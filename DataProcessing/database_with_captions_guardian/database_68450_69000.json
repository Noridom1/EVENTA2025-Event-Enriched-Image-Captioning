        "content": "But \u2018landmark agreement\u2019 signed by 24 countries also notable for absences of major manufacturers\nTwenty-four countries and a group of leading car manufacturers have committed to ending the era of fossil-fuel powered vehicles by 2040 \u201cor earlier\u201d, in a major new commitment set at Cop26.\nThe agreement to sell only zero-emissions vehicles from this time, unveiled at the UN climate summit in Glasgow on Wednesday, includes Canada, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Ireland and the UK, which had already agreed to phase out new petrol and diesel car sales by 2030.\nFord, Mercedes, Volvo and Mercedes-Benz are among the carmakers to sign the accord, pledging to reach the goal by 2035 in \u201cleading markets\u201d, as have numerous cities and regional governments, including New York, London, Barcelona and the Australian Capital Territory.\nA further group of countries, including India and Kenya, have agreed to \u201cwork intensely towards accelerated proliferation\u201d of zero-emissions vehicles, while a group of financiers and fleet owners have also vowed to phase out fossil fuel-powered cars.\nBut the agreement is also notable for its absences, with the US, China and Germany, the behemoths of the global car industry, all declining to sign. Volkswagen and Toyota have also not put their name to the deal, along with BMW, which told the Financial Times there was still \u201cconsiderable uncertainty about the development of global infrastructure to support a complete shift to zero-emissions vehicles\u201d. Toyota said: \u201cAlthough we refrain from joining the statement, we share the same spirit and determination to address climate change and remain open to engage and work with stakeholders. Toyota will continue to contribute by making the best efforts to achieve carbon neutrality.\u201d\nNegotiators had hoped to announce a sweeping deal involving governments and car manufacturers that committed them to reaching 100% zero-emissions cars and vans by 2035.\nThe British government, however, has hailed the agreement as a \u201clandmark global agreement\u201d and pointed out that in combination with existing pledges to phase out polluting cars, most notably by the European Union, it will cover nearly a third of global car sales. Before the conference UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, had said the mantra of Cop would be \u201ccoal, cash, cars and trees\u201d; he will be hoping this deal means that all four have been covered, to some extent.\nTransport accounts for a fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions and the International Energy Agency has said the sale of fossil fuel-powered cars will have to cease by 2035 if the world is to avoid surpassing dangerous global heating thresholds.\n\u201cCop26 marks the end of the road for the internal combustion engine,\u201d said Helen Clarkson, the chief executive of Climate Group. She added: \u201cI welcome all leaders standing with us today to show the world that the shift to clean road transport is not only happening, but accelerating.\n\u201cFor those organisations notably absent \u2013 the climate cannot wait for you to get onboard with zero-emission vehicles. It\u2019s time to get out of the slow lane before you miss the exit.\u201d\nSteven van Weyenberg, the environment minister of the Netherlands, said it was \u201ctime to speed up\u201d the transition to electric vehicles. \u201cNot just for the climate,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone has the right to breathe clean air. This cuts both ways \u2013 investments now will lead to more green jobs in the coming years. I call on other countries to join our effort as soon as possible.\u201d\nActivists at Cop26 have called on governments to move away from all types of cars and instead transform cities and towns to become more amenable to walking, cycling and taking public transport. A protest to call for better investment in public transport is taking place in Glasgow on Thursday morning.\n\u201cThe evidence is clear that we cannot put all our faith in electric cars \u2013 we need a more fundamental shift in how we get around, and we have much to gain from this,\u201d said Jools Townsend, the chair of the Sustainable Transport Alliance.\n\u201cBy focusing on a shift towards public, shared and community transport, walking and cycling, we can create healthier, happier communities and more equal access to opportunity, without adding to emissions and environmental problems through the manufacture of millions more cars.\u201d\nA group of city mayors from around the world said last week that investment in public transport needed to double if climate breakdown was to be averted. \u201cWithout a revolution in public transport the world will miss the bus on tackling climate change,\u201d said Anies Baswedan, governor of Jakarta.\n\u201cTime is running out.\u201d",

The pub chain said these drinks were all popular with younger people.\nDraught products, which Wetherspoon\u2019s said were more often consumed by older customers, have been under pressure, with traditional ales down by 30% and stout down by 20%.\nMartin, who has been an outspoken critic of the social mixing restrictions that have hampered pub trade for much of the pandemic, said older customers had \u201cunderstandably\u201d been wary of going to the pub.\nLaura Hoy, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the company could suffer in the event of a long-term trend towards younger patrons and away from its older regulars.\n\u201cWetherspoon\u2019s tends to cater to the latter group, so a permanent shift in that direction could be bad news,\u201d she said.\n\u201cMore likely is an abundance of caution among vulnerable populations as Covid continues to spread despite vaccine efforts. This attitude should wane as the pandemic comes under control but there\u2019s no telling how long that will take.\u201d\nWetherspoon\u2019s put an 8.1% slump in food sales down to more people working from home and eschewing the allure of its breakfasts, down by 22%, and its coffees, down by 30%.\nWith office workers staying away, the worst affected region was London, down 17.4%, offsetting relatively buoyant trade in cities such as Liverpool, Newcastle, Nottingham and Oxford, where sales were up 11.3%.\nLingering travel restrictions meant that trade was significantly lower in airports, down 38.8%, stations, down 22.4%, while sales also fell in Scotland (-12.2%) and Northern Ireland (-11.0%), where some restrictions still apply.\n\u201cWith no music in Wetherspoon pubs (apart from 46 trading as Lloyds), a material proportion of our trade comes from older customers, some of whom have visited pubs less frequently in recent times,\u201d Martin said.\n\u201cAs outlined in our annual report, published in October 2021, there have been no outbreaks of Covid-19, as defined by the health authorities, among customers in Wetherspoon pubs.\n\u201cHowever, some customers have been understandably cautious. Improvement in trade will therefore depend, to some extent, on the outlook for the Covid-19 virus.\u201d\nMartin has been a vocal backer of Brexit but the pub chain he founded suffered shortages of some beers earlier this year, amid a shortage of delivery drivers partly caused by the UK\u2019s exit from the EU.\nThe company said it had experienced problems \u201cfrom time to time\u201d but that the problem had eased in recent weeks, albeit with the caveat that the hectic Christmas period was yet to come.\nWetherspoon\u2019s also said it had not suffered badly from a difficulty across the hospitality sector in finding staff. The number of employees has increased from 36,987 when pubs reopened in April 2021 to 42,240 today, it said.",

He learned ironmongery, making a horseshoe as a gift for the film\u2019s director, Jane Campion, and woodworking, which involved carving a set of miniature wooden furniture.\nAlso like his character, Cumberbatch said he didn\u2019t wash himself. \u201cI wanted that layer of stink on me. I wanted people in the room to know what I smelled like. It was hard, though. It wasn\u2019t just in rehearsals. I was going out to eat and meet friends of Jane and stuff. I was a bit embarrassed by the cleaner, in the place I was living.\u201d\nAnd, in true method acting style, Cumberbatch said he stopped answering to his real name. \u201cIf someone forgot \u2026 and called me Benedict, I wouldn\u2019t move.\u201d\nThe Power of the Dog is released in the UK on 19 November.",

He said: \u201cWe all think we got there on merit. I like to think we did, but nonetheless, on balance, a disproportionate number of people like me got there on merit, if you see what I mean.\u201d\nBoulton has been with the rolling news channel since its launch in February 1989, including a 25-year stint as its political editor. The 62-year-old, who is the channel\u2019s editor-at-large and presents the morning All Out Politics show, will remain as an occasional contributor but will also look to work elsewhere.\nHis departure comes at a time of transition for Sky News, which was an integral part of the initial channel line-up for Rupert Murdoch\u2019s pay-TV satellite service. The channel was known for being fast to break news and gained influence by offering politicians and journalists the chance to appear on air \u2013 making it a constant presence in MPs\u2019 offices and newspaper newsrooms.\nHowever, in common with other rolling news channels, it now has to work out how to serve audiences who are less tied to television screens and more likely to get breaking news through social media on their mobile phones.\nThe main Sky News channel continues to have a substantial reach, with an estimated 7.5 million Britons watching some of its output in the last month. But many people dip in for only a few minutes at a time and viewing figures for individual shows can be low. As a result the much smaller rightwing upstart channel GB News sometimes pushes Sky News close in specific time slots.\nWhen Murdoch sold the entire Sky business to the US media conglomerate Comcast in 2018, the new owners agreed to subsidise the lossmaking Sky News for a decade \u2013 giving an effective deadline to find a future for the outlet. Staff at the channel have become increasingly intrigued by the role of David Rhodes, an American former boss of CBS News who joined Sky this summer and has been taking an interest in how the news service operates.\nThe other big question at Sky News headquarters is whether any presenters could be tempted to jump ship to Murdoch\u2019s forthcoming talkTV channel, which is due to launch next year and will be fronted by Piers Morgan.",

Pints are dispensed from an onstage bar while nine burly blokes with seven beards between them croon and stomp through a jukebox\u2019s worth of dad rock hits: You\u2019re the Voice, I\u2019m Gonna Be (500 Miles), Somebody to Love. It can feel at times like being trapped in Jeremy Clarkson\u2019s CD player.\nOur T-shirted MC is Ben Norris, whose poetic asides provide connective tissue. When he isn\u2019t singing the praises of the pub (\u201cIts clarion call is \u2018gather\u2019\u201d), he is giving his bros the hard-sell. Bartender Mark Loveday is \u201cmore beer than man\u201d. Miles Anthony Daley, responsible for a goosebump-inducing cover of Adele\u2019s Hello, is \u201csecretly shy\u201d. Daniel Harnett is \u201cthe self-appointed king of banter\u201d. We have to take Norris\u2019s word for all this since no one develops beyond his thumbnail sketches, which have the effect of aggressively sentimentalising the performers (\u201cHis home was the sea with Dad or a cuddle with Mum\u201d) while keeping them at arm\u2019s length.\nThe atmosphere is very New Man but there are intriguing hints of caveman, too. The boast that \u201cthere\u2019s no burgers or brioche here \u2013 it\u2019s pork scratchings or nothing at all\u201d recalls Al Murray\u2019s Pub Landlord, who would certainly approve of all the testosterone on tap. Women are absent except for female audience members dragged on stage to sit ramrod-straight while being serenaded.\nAnyone sceptical of the show\u2019s ingratiating, calculated warmth and synthetic bonhomie is likely to have the sensation of being present at a cult. It would be churlish, though, to deny that The Choir of Man will go down a storm with office outings, or that it contains moments of unmistakable power, such as the rousing, a cappella spin on Sia\u2019s Chandelier.\nThe one outright misjudgment comes when Red Hot Chili Peppers\u2019 Under the Bridge is performed in front of a mobile urinal. Even the finest close-harmonising can\u2019t alter the fact that we\u2019re watching a row of men peeing in the middle of a pub.

So, please look after them,\u201d he said. \u201cDamaging your own stuff doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d He insisted he would rather they didn\u2019t call them \u201cBurnham Bikes\u201d but stick to their Sunday name, inspired by Manchester\u2019s civic symbol, the worker bee.\nIn 2017 Manchester was the first UK city to test dockless bike hire when the Chinese firm Mobike pedalled into town.\nWithin a year Mobike gave up, after hundreds of bikes each month ended up at the bottom of the Manchester Ship Canal and various other waterways. Others were strung up lampposts, abandoned in the Arndale shopping centre, locked in secure car parks and hidden in sheds. A startling number had their locks hacked off \u2013 and with them, their inbuilt GPS trackers.\nBee Bikes are owned by Greater Manchester but will be operated for the first five years by Beryl, a private company which runs schemes in the West Midlands, Bournemouth, the Isle of Wight and beyond. They are part of Burnham\u2019s aim to build the UK\u2019s first carbon-neutral transport city region network by 2031, consisting of bikes, buses and trams.\nBy summer 2022, 1,500 yellow bikes, including 300 electric models, will be available to the public in parts of Manchester, Salford and Trafford. If successful, the fleet will be expanded to cover the whole of Greater Manchester, with more electric bikes in the hilliest suburbs, according to Chris Boardman, the Olympic champion turned Greater Manchester travel commissioner.\nHe admitted being apprehensive in the run-up to the 18 November launch. \u201cVandalism is something that you don\u2019t have control over,\u201d he said. But he stressed that Greater Manchester police (GMP) had been involved in planning the scheme, whereas Mobikes were just \u201cdumped on the street\u201d with minimal notice.\nAs well as being too easy to pinch, Mobikes were also uncomfortable, having only one gear and apparently being designed for tiny people. \u201cI\u2019m only 5ft 8 and I still couldn\u2019t get the saddle to go high enough,\u201d said Boardman.\nThe Bee Bikes have three gears and the saddle can be adjusted to suit riders between 4ft 11in and 6ft 5in (149cm to 195cm). It costs 50p to unlock a pedal bike and 5p a minute of cycling, or \u00a31 to unlock an e-bike and 10p a minute to ride.\nCycle hire stations will typically be between 300 metres and 500 metres apart, ensuring that up to 198,000 residents are never more than a five-minute walk from a bicycle.\nThe bikes should be parked in branded docks, otherwise riders receive fines of \u00a35 or \u00a310 depending on how far away they abandon theirs. Unlike London\u2019s Santander scheme, the dock does not lock the bike in place, but encourages sensible parking.\nIf the dock is full, users can still leave their bike locked to itself nearby and not get penalised. \u201cIt means you never need miss your train because there are no spaces at the station,\u201d said Boardman.\nA team of 17 Beryl staff will be whizzing around the city redistributing and fixing bikes all day and night, he added.\nPhil Ellis, the chief executive of Beryl, insisted he had no hesitation to pitch for the contract. \u201cIt might have seemed that Manchester is the wild west, but it wasn\u2019t really. Vandalism was not a unique problem to the city. It happens everywhere. We were thrilled to be selected to run the scheme,\u201d he said.\nUltimately, the success of the Bee Bikes will not be simply down to how many remain roadworthy, but whether Mancunians like to ride them. A lot of that comes down to safety, said Graeme Sherriff, a researcher in healthy active cities at the University of Salford.\n\u201cThe cycling environment generally is also a challenge. It has to be cycleable if you have a bike hire scheme,\u201d he said. \u201cCurrently, Greater Manchester isn\u2019t very cycle-friendly, but it is getting better.\u201d\nBoardman is trying to build 1,800 miles of safe walking and cycling routes as part of the Bee Network, but so far only a fraction of the network is complete after wranglings with Greater Manchester\u2019s 10 councils.\nEdinburgh\u2019s Just Eat cycle hire scheme lasted three years before its operator, Serco, threw in the towel in September, saying it would not extend the contract amid higher-than-expected costs for vandalism. In 2020 about one in four of the scheme\u2019s 550 bikes had to be repaired every week.\nThe CEO of Mobike admitted in a company blog that more than 200,000 of its bicycles were lost to theft or vandalism in 2019. It now no longer operates outside China.\nOfo, another Chinese firm, gave up on the UK in 2019 after ill-fated schemes in London, Norwich, Sheffield and Oxford.\nSantander Bikes, aka Boris Bikes, are the grandparents of the bike hire world, having been launched in 2010 by the then mayor of London. Londoners now have access to more than 750 docking stations and more than 14,000 bikes.\nThis year Leicester launched what the council said would be the UK\u2019s biggest docked electric bike-sharing scheme. Santander Cycles Leicester will eventually make 500 electric bikes available to hire from 50 locations.\nNext Bikes, which operates Glasgow\u2019s Ovo bike sharing programme, expanded its scheme before Cop26 came to the city.",

The child\u2019s maternal relatives appealed against the ruling; a hearing on the case will be held in Tel Aviv on Thursday.\nEitan, who suffered injuries to his head and legs in the crash, went to live with his paternal aunt, Aya Biran-Nirko, in Pavia after he was discharged from hospital in June. Biran-Nirko was granted temporary custody soon after the tragedy so that Eitan, who has Italian and Israeli passports, could continue to receive the necessary medical care.\nHowever, this was contested by relatives on his mother\u2019s side in Israel, and tensions between the two sides of the family escalated.\nThe boy was taken to Israel in September in a private plane that prosecutors said cost \u20ac42,000.\nEitan was born in Israel but had been living in Italy since he was one month old. He had been due to start school two days after his alleged abduction.\nEitan\u2019s paternal relatives claimed he had been taken away against their wishes and immediately filed a petition for his return to Italy. Peleg argued he had acted in the boy\u2019s best interests.\nThe prosecutor Mario Venditti told Ansa news agency: \u201cWe are waiting for the response of the Israeli authorities to the international arrest warrant. Then we will proceed with the closure of the investigation and the request for a trial.\u201d\nEitan\u2019s great-grandparents also died in the crash, which is believed to have happened when a lead cable snapped, causing the cabin to hurtle backwards before falling about 20 metres into a wooded area below. The wreckage of the cabin was removed on Tuesday amid an ongoing investigation into the cause of the crash.",

        "content": "MP says he will accept judgment of commissioner over allegation he did legal work from Commons office\nThe former attorney general Geoffrey Cox has said he will submit to the judgment of the parliamentary watchdog over whether he breached a rule by working on his second job from the House of Commons, as he defended his right to advise the British Virgin Islands (BVI) authorities while a Tory MP.\nThe MP for Torridge and West Devon has been under fire for appearing to conduct a public hearing as a lawyer while in parliament, and using a proxy vote while working in the BVI.\nIn a statement, he said he had consulted the chief whip about voting in the Commons from abroad during lockdown and was \u201cadvised that it was appropriate\u201d. He also said his work for the BVI authorities was \u201cnot to \u2018defend\u2019 a tax haven or, as has been inaccurately reported, to defend any wrongdoing but to assist the public inquiry in getting to the truth\u201d.\n\u201cNo evidence of tax evasion or personal corruption has been adduced before the inquiry and if it had been, that person would have been required to seek their own representation,\u201d he said.\nOn the issue of appearing at a public hearing as a lawyer while in his parliamentary office, Cox did not take the opportunity to deny that this had taken place.\nHis statement said: \u201cAs for the allegation that he breached the parliamentary code of conduct on one occasion, on 14 September 2021, by being in his office while participating in an online hearing in the public inquiry and voting in the House of Commons, he understands that the matter has been referred to the parliamentary commissioner and he will fully cooperate with her investigation. He does not believe that he breached the rules but will of course accept the judgment of the parliamentary commissioner or of the committee on the matter.\u201d\nMore generally, Cox said he had made \u201cno secret of his professional activities\u201d and regularly worked 70-hour weeks, always ensuring his casework for constituents was given primary importance.\nCox released the statement after ministers distanced themselves from his activities, with Sajid Javid, the health secretary, saying MPs should not be using parliament for private jobs and ought to be devoting the vast majority of their time to their constituents.\nJavid defended the right of MPs to have second jobs but gave a clear answer that they should not be using Commons facilities to do that. He also expressed regret about having supported the government\u2019s motion to change the standards system last week.\nThe government has been in crisis for a week over allegations of financial sleaze after a failed attempt by No 10 to overhaul the rules around investigations into MPs, the resignation of the Tory MP Owen Paterson after he was found to have broken lobbying rules, and the latest furore over Cox.\nAdditionally, the former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith is facing questions over his \u00a325,000-a-year second job advising a multimillion-pound hand sanitiser company after he chaired a government taskforce that recommended new rules benefiting the firm.\nAfter Boris Johnson\u2019s failed attempt to overhaul the standards rules, Andrew Bowie, a Conservative party vice-chair with portfolios for youth and the union, handed in his resignation, though he has agreed to stay in the role until a replacement is found.\nWith Paterson having quit, the pressure is now on Cox, who is under scrutiny over his lucrative legal work on top of his job as an MP. Footage of Cox reportedly at a hearing in September showed a background similar to those of MPs\u2019 offices. After it surfaced, Angela Rayner, the Labour deputy leader, urged the standards commissioner to investigate, and called it \u201ca slap in the face and an insult to British taxpayers\u201d.\nJavid said he would not get into the specific case of Cox, and praised him as having been a \u201cfantastic cabinet minister\u201d, but said it was important that MPs \u201ccontinue to spend the vast majority of their time on their parliamentary affairs and their constituency affairs\u201d.\nCox has been paid about \u00a31m over the course of a year for legal work, including that for the BVI authorities advising on a public inquiry into corruption allegations brought by the UK Foreign Office.\nJavid defended the principle of second jobs but said MPs should be \u201ccompletely transparent and open\u201d.\nWhen asked by Sky News whether MPs should use their parliamentary offices for private work, he said: \u201cNo.\u201d He added: \u201cOf course you shouldn\u2019t be using, whether it\u2019s your parliamentary office \u2026 parliamentary stationery or anything that\u2019s funded or supported by the taxpayer, of course that should not be used. I think the rules are clear and of course all MPs would be expected to observe that at all times.\n\u201cI\u2019m not the judge of this, nor should I be \u2013 it should independently judged by the parliamentary standards commissioner, so if there are particular cases then I will trust the commissioner to look at that and come to the right decision.\u201d\nCox, 61, declared his extra earnings as a barrister. But he faced criticism for the many hours spent on work unrelated to the Commons and the \u00a3150,000 he was paid for giving legal advice to the BVI.\nOn Monday the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said Cox\u2019s work overseas was \u201ca legitimate thing to do as long as it\u2019s properly declared\u201d and it was quite important to have \u201csome knowledge of what\u2019s going on\u201d in the BVI.",

        "content": "Hayhoe says people can use their roles in their workplaces and communities to act on the climate crisis\nKatharine Hayhoe has wrestled with her climate footprint. The climate scientist, who is now chief scientist for the nonprofit The Nature Conservancy, was shocked when she realized how much of her personal emissions came from work travel. But are these more justifiable because her work is educating people about the climate crisis?\nThere has long been a debate about how much individual actions matter when it comes to climate. The oil industry\u2019s promotion of the concept of the carbon footprint has led some to believe that the whole idea is a huge distraction technique to divert attention from corporations driving the crisis. But as Greta Thunberg demonstrates, individuals can have a big impact, just not always in ways that can be measured.\nPart of the challenge is that we have no good way to conceptualize our impact as individuals. I came up with the concept of a \u201cclimate shadow\u201d to try to help visualize how the sum of our life choices influences the climate emergency. Your shadow includes the car you drive and what you eat, but it\u2019s also about where you work, how you engage in the workplace, where you invest your money and how much you talk about climate.\nI spoke with Hayhoe about the limitations of the carbon footprint, the impact we can have as employees and community members, and why it may be more profound than we think.\nThe interview has been edited for clarity and length.\nThere\u2019s an ongoing debate about individual responsibility versus corporate responsibility when it comes to carbon emissions and the climate crisis. A lot of people feel as if there\u2019s nothing they can do to make a difference \u2013 we\u2019re just individuals. And yet, corporations are made up of individuals.\nAbsolutely. I mean, look [at the climate strikes] at Amazon, that really shows the power of individual people using their voices. When you look at how change has happened before with corporations, with governments, with cities, it\u2019s because one or two or three or four people began by using their voice, and typically they were not the people at the top.\nIt reminds me of a story in my book about a guy who works for a big hospital in New York. He was horrified to find out that their pension fund was invested in fossil fuels when fossil fuel air pollution is responsible for almost 9m premature deaths a year. He said: \u201cIsn\u2019t our Hippocratic oath to do no harm?\u201d\nSo he talked to the pension fund about it and they said: \u201cwell, we don\u2019t care.\u201d Then he started a petition. He started going around the hospital talking to the doctors, the nurses, and the other people who work there, saying, \u201cwould you be interested in signing this petition?\u201d I don\u2019t even know if he has succeeded yet, he hadn\u2019t when I wrote the book, but that\u2019s what he\u2019s doing. That\u2019s his attempt to use his voice.\nEverybody has a voice, and wherever you work, you have the ability to use your voice.\nOne of the reasons I created the climate shadow was my frustration with the carbon footprint and how it devalues actions that can\u2019t be measured, such as voting or activism. Can you speak a little bit about the tension between higher impact actions that can\u2019t be measured and actions that have less impact but can be measured?\nI think that climate shadow is such a powerful concept. Ten years ago I stepped on the carbon scale, so to speak, to measure my carbon footprint. I was genuinely shocked to find out that the biggest part of it was my travel. I was going to a lot of scientific meetings and going places to talk to people about climate change.\nI decided that I was going to transition most of my talks to virtual talks and when I traveled, I was going to bundle my talks. One of my last bundled trips was to Alaska, where I visited three different cities and did 28 events with an average of 75 people per event. So I spoke to about 2,000 people and I calculated that if eight individual people reduced their individual carbon footprint by 10% as a result of listening to me talk \u2013 and a 10% reduction is very easy to achieve \u2013 then that was the carbon of my flight.\nNow let\u2019s extrapolate this. Say that I put solar panels on my house. That\u2019s great. But what if my place of work transitions to clean energy? You can calculate the difference, we\u2019re talking orders of magnitude. But my place of work is only going to transition to solar energy if someone starts the conversation.\nYour recent book, Saving Us, is focused on hope and fighting hopelessness. And it does seem that if we want to tackle that hopelessness, the most important thing we can do is empower people within their corporate and political groups. Can you speak to that?\nSomehow we see corporations as not being made up of people, but they are made up of people. Every big organization is made up of people. In some corporations, the leadership is aware of the problem but they\u2019re not sure what to do. In some cases, they would make a change, but people just haven\u2019t called for it.\nWe often have the image of corporations being completely immovable, but they\u2019re made up of people who want to do the right thing. Even in the fossil fuel industry, there are people at those corporations who want to do the right thing.\nOften people feel that they\u2019re just trying to hold on to their jobs and survive. How do we navigate that so people aren\u2019t like: \u2018Oh great, now I have to also be a climate warrior on top of just trying to not get fired\u2019?\nWe think of climate change as a separate issue on our priority list, but the only reason you care about climate change is because of what\u2019s already at the top of your list \u2013 keeping your job, taking care of your family, worrying about your health, worrying about your kids, worrying about the place where you live \u2013 whatever it is that you\u2019re already worrying about.\nWhen you are taking action for climate, it\u2019s not for climate change, it\u2019s for you. It\u2019s for your family, it\u2019s for everything you love, everyone you love, every place that you love \u2013 that\u2019s why you\u2019re doing it. There\u2019s a significant mind shift there, so that we don\u2019t see it as an extra \u201cto do\u201d on our list.",

However, on Wednesday a panel of five supreme court justices allowed an appeal by Google against that decision.\nGiving the lead ruling, Lord Leggatt said Lloyd\u2019s intention that affected iPhone users could be awarded a uniform sum, without having to prove financial loss or mental distress, was \u201cunsustainable\u201d.\nLeggatt said the section of the DPA on which the claim was based referred to material damage and mental distress caused by unlawful processing of data \u2013 and not the unlawful processing itself. A catch-all lawsuit that did not detail each individual\u2019s suffering of material damage or mental distress was therefore unsustainable.\nThe judge said: \u201cWhat gives the appearance of substance to the claim is the allegation that Google secretly tracked the internet activity of millions of Apple iPhone users for several months and used the data obtained for commercial purposes. But on analysis the claimant is seeking to recover damages without attempting to prove that this allegation is true in the case of any individual for whom damages are claimed.\n\u201cWithout proof of some unlawful processing of an individual\u2019s personal data beyond the bare minimum required to bring them within the definition of the represented class, a claim on behalf of that individual has no prospect of meeting the threshold for an award of damages.\u201d\nGoogle\u2019s lawyers argued at a hearing in April that the landmark appeal court ruling could \u201copen the floodgates\u201d to vast claims brought on behalf of millions of people against companies responsible for handling people\u2019s data.\nEmily Cox, the head of disputes at Stewarts law firm, said the ruling was a relief for big tech firms that handle the data of millions of people in England and Wales on a daily basis.\n\u201cThis decision ensures the floodgates remain firmly closed to data privacy class actions in England and Wales, much to the relief of big tech, but it also leaves consumers without a viable route to compensation for breaches of their privacy rights by large corporations and so limits access to justice.\u201d\nJonathan McDonald, a partner at the law firm Charles Russell Speechlys, said: \u201cHad Google lost the appeal, this could have kicked open the floodgates for mass litigations in the technology sector.\u201d\nGoogle You Owe Us and Lloyd claimed Google bypassed privacy settings on Apple iPhone handsets between August 2011 and February 2012 and used the data gathered to divide people into categories for advertisers.\nThey said \u201cbrowser-generated information\u201d collected by Google included racial or ethnic origin, physical and mental health, political affiliations or opinions, sexual interests and social class. Google\u2019s lawyers said there was no suggestion the so-called Safari workaround had resulted in any information being disclosed to third parties.\nLloyd said: \u201cWe are bitterly disappointed that the supreme court has failed to do enough to protect the public from Google and other big tech firms who break the law.\u201d\nA Google spokesperson said: \u201cThis claim was related to events that took place a decade ago and that we addressed at the time. People want to know that they are safe and secure online, which is why for years we\u2019ve focused on building products and infrastructure that respect and protect people\u2019s privacy.\u201d\nMeanwhile, a top EU court on Wednesday rejected Google\u2019s appeal against a \u20ac2.4bn (\u00a32.1bn) fine from regulators who found the tech giant had abused its massive online reach by giving its own shopping recommendations an illegal advantage in its search results.\nThe European Commission, the EU\u2019s executive arm, punished Google in 2017 for unfairly favouring its own shopping service over competitors. The European court of justice\u2019s general court ruled it \u201clargely dismisses\u201d Google\u2019s appeal against that antitrust penalty and upheld the fine.",

It sold 153m shares, more than the 135m it aimed for initially.\nThe increased offer price means Rivian will raise $11.9bn, putting it among the top 10 initial public offerings of all time in the US, according to data from Dealogic.\nMore than 20 investment banks are involved in running the sale, led by Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan.\nThe raised price reflects the huge demand for shares in electric carmakers on the day that a series of carmakers and countries pledged to move away from fossil fuels by 2040 or earlier at the Cop26 climate conference in Glasgow.\nThe surge in interest has propelled Tesla, the electric car pioneer, into the ranks of the world\u2019s trillion-dollar public companies. A $65bn valuation would put Rivian roughly equal with BMW, the German carmaker that delivered 2.3m cars in 2020.\nUnlike BMW or Tesla, Rivian is yet to record meaningful revenues, let alone profits. It revealed losses over 2019 and 2020 of $1.4bn plus borrowing of $2.5bn when it filed for the offering in October.\nHowever, Rivian has the advantage of backing from Amazon, founded by Jeff Bezos, the world\u2019s second-richest person after the Tesla boss, Elon Musk.\nBezos rode in one of Rivian\u2019s prototype electric SUVs to the launchpad of his spacecraft in July, in effect providing advertising to the carmaker.\nAmazon owns 22% of Rivian\u2019s shares and has committed to buying 100,000 electric delivery vehicles from the startup by 2025. Rivian can sell delivery vans only to Amazon for four years.\nRivian\u2019s debut product, the R1, will be available in pickup or SUV varieties, competing with Tesla\u2019s Model X and electric SUVs from older manufacturers such as Ford and Audi as well as newer entrants including the US\u2019s Fisker and Canoo or China\u2019s NIO.\nRivian will manufacture the R1 and commercial vans at a factory in Normal, Illinois. However, Irvine in California is home to the car\u2019s engineering and design, including crucial work on propulsion and battery technology.\nThe company could make revenues of between $20bn and $25bn by 2025 if it achieves its aim of 350,000 vehicles produced annually at that plant, according to Chris McNally, an automotive analyst at Evercore ISI investment bank.",

No, really \u2013 Trump is in power! Has the world gone mad? And how do I find my place in it? Milk and Gall uses the frightening sense of dislocation that many felt with the election of Donald Trump to frame the equally jolting experience that is new motherhood. It\u2019s just a shame Mathilde Dratwa\u2019s play is being staged a year later than originally planned, which would have meant a run that coincided with the chaotic and frightening final days of Trump\u2019s presidency. The piece risks feeling slightly dated as a result \u2013 but this is still a striking debut with a wonderfully confident, surreal swagger to it.\nDratwa is based in New York and the play unfolds in a Brooklyn apartment, which looks impressively accurate (designer Mona Camille has a sharp eye for detail) then cracks and splinters as new mum Vera\u2019s world begins to implode. Vera asks Alexa how to talk to her baby \u2013 and Alexa starts to talk back, only the advice she offers grows increasingly strange. An FBI agent storms into the living room on the hunt for a lost mother; a model baby is eaten alive and, in one particularly memorable moment, Hillary Clinton crawls out of the TV and bursts into song.\nDirector Lisa Spirling handles the comic flourishes with control and panache and encourages lively performances from her cast of five. MyAnna Buring is physically compelling as new mum Vera: every movement is accompanied by a wince in the early days following her C-section and there\u2019s a striking disconnect between the ferocity of Vera\u2019s speech and the fragility of her body. The whole ensemble is strong but Jenny Galloway almost stops time with her comic timing as she rattles through a host of kooky cameos.\nLots of the laughter comes with the sting of truth but the dislocated scenes never quite add up to something bigger. Vera\u2019s potential post-partum depression is mentioned but rarely felt and the dramatic encounters between Vera and her family and friends feel underpowered; a sideshow to the stronger and more truthful comic skits.\nAt Theatre 503, London, until 27 November",

        "content": "PC, PS4/5, Xbox; ActivisionA band of inglorious stereotypes go on a covert mission to uncover a Nazi plan in a traditional instalment of the series\nThere is always a sense of deja vu with Call of Duty games. For almost 20 years, they have led us through so many bombed-out cities, treacherous canyon passes and collapsing multi-storey buildings, the whole run now merges into one apocalyptic mega battle. By taking us back to the origin of the series \u2013 the second world war \u2013 Vanguard hammers this sense of familiarity home. This is a very traditional, extremely familiar and almost nostalgic Call of Duty instalment.\nFor the entertaining Campaign mode, we\u2019re thrust into a covert mission involving an international task force of six differently skilled soldiers attempting to infiltrate a German submarine base to uncover a Nazi plan known as Operation Phoenix. As this is taking place in Germany in 1945 and features rogue SS officers (one brilliantly played by Dominic Monaghan, the nature of a plan named Phoenix should not be too hard to guess, but we still have to fight through around six hours of hectic, bullet-riddled missions to get there.\nIn a twist of cinematic narrative grace, the squad \u2013 let\u2019s call them the Dirty Half-Dozen \u2013 is captured early on, and most of the game is a series of flashbacks giving us the origin stories of each of the characters. There\u2019s cynical Russian sniper Polina Petrova, gung ho American pilot, Wade Jackson and conscientious British special forces officer Arthur Kingsley, and with them we whiz through key second world war flashpoints from Tobruk to Normandy, ticking off staple CoD set-pieces as we go. There\u2019s a last stand against waves of incoming enemies, a flight combat bit, a tank bit, and you get to try out a range of authentic period weapons. What keeps it all together is a tight script that keeps the noninteractive sequences to a minimum, explores issues of diversity and personal tragedy in war and actually makes us care about this band of inglorious stereotypes.\nAlongside the single-player Campaign is the usual range of online multiplayer options. Team Deathmatch and Domination are here, alongside newcomers such as Champion Hill, a sort of mini team-based Battle Royale organised into short elimination rounds. The pace of combat is almost ludicrously fast, and for your first few days of play your average lifespan between respawns will be roughly two seconds. You arrive, look about a bit, take one step \u2026 and then a 14-year-old wielding a tricked-out MP 40 submachine gun will riddle you with bullets. Repeat. Repeat again. The 20 or so maps are mostly very traditional three-lane set-ups, channelling the action through mountain-top Nazi meeting houses, north African villages and submarine bases \u2013 none have significantly interesting features or clever interactive elements, but they do the job.\nThe Zombies mode (another mainstay of the CoD series), takes the usual recipe \u2013 a team of players battling hordes of the undead \u2013 and makes changes. In previous instalments, the action was very round-based: you had to survive waves of progressively tough enemies. Now there are objectives to fight through, including patrol missions where you have to follow a glowing artefact, and a quest where you must harvest rune stones from fallen foes and feed them into the Sin Eater obelisk \u2013 the most literal interpretation of the \u201cfetch quest\u201d archetype that we\u2019ve encountered in the series. It really messes with the rhythm and tension of the mode and you lose that pure sense of making a desperate last stand against the undead. You can still upgrade your weapons and unlock supernatural abilities, but the progression system feels a little lightweight and unfocused. There will be tweaks and new features in the near future, but it feels like they need to come sooner rather than later.\nCall of Duty: Vanguard is the video game equivalent of an old war film that you\u2019ve seen many times before, but still enjoy watching with a feeling of nostalgic comfort that armed conflict perhaps should not provide. It won\u2019t set the world alight, but gives you the opportunity to blow a lot of it up \u2013 which is, after all, what we want from this series.\n Call of Duty: Vanguard is out now; \u00a359.99.",

Many commodity-rich developing countries have been relying increasingly on resource-backed loans \u2013 in which they secure finance from lenders by putting up future revenue streams as collateral.\nResource-backed loans accounted for almost 10% of new borrowing in sub-Saharan Africa between 2004 and 2018, the Bank said. More than 15 countries had such debt but none provided details on the collateral arrangements.\nThe bank\u2019s report, Debt Transparency in Developing Economies, expressed concern that low-income countries were starting to use central-bank repurchases and foreign-currency swaps to support external borrowing rather than as tools of monetary policy. \u201cThese operations do not show up in government debt statistics, and the databases of international financial institutions do not capture them either,\u201d Malpass said.\n\u201cImproving debt transparency requires a sound public debt-management legal framework, integrated debt recording and management systems, and improvements in the global debt monitoring. International financial institutions, debtors, creditors and other stakeholders, such as credit-rating agencies and civil society, all have a key role to play in fostering debt transparency.\u201d\nThe bank said it had long considered debt transparency a crucial step in countries\u2019 development strategies because being open led to new investment, improved accountability and helped reduce corruption. All countries that borrow from the organisation \u2013 more than 100 in total \u2013 were required to report details of external debt owed by any public agency.",

Most students at that time were studying online owing to lockdown restrictions, while this term students have returned to campuses for more face-to-face teaching.\nOn vaccination, the survey \u2013 which is based on experimental data drawn from responses from almost 1,000 students in England during October and November \u2013 found that 91% of respondents had been vaccinated against Covid at least once.\nThe proportion of students who have been double-vaccinated was 85%, up from 78% in late September. Of the 8% who said they had not been vaccinated, almost a third (32%) said they were fairly or very likely to take a vaccine if offered.\nStudents also showed they were willing to test for Covid: 92% said they would request a test if they developed symptoms, and 49% said they had taken a test in the previous seven days. Meanwhile, 57% said they would stay at home for 10 days if they developed symptoms.\nLast year students were often accused of spreading the virus by holding parties in breach of restrictions, and some were fined and threatened with exclusion from their university studies.\nTim Gibbs, the head of the ONS student Covid-19 insights survey, said: \u201cIt is encouraging, the majority of students report being vaccinated against Covid-19, and many would get tested if they developed symptoms. However, a third of students sadly reported their mental health and wellbeing had worsened since the start of the autumn term.\u201d\nNick Hillman, the director of the Higher Education Policy Institute thinktank, said: \u201cThis shows that students are largely very sensible \u2013 they are getting tested and vaccinated and they are trying to progress with their studies as best they can. But they are not finding life as easy as they had hoped because student life continues to be so disrupted by Covid. Going away to university is a big transition point at the best of times; it is extra stressful in the very odd times in which we live.\u201d\nStudents at 58 institutions face the possibility of further disruption to their studies because of threatened strike action by university staff who voted in favour of industrial action in two ballots over pensions and pay and working conditions. The University and College Union will meet later this week to decide on its plans.\n This article was amended on 15 November 2021. An earlier headline \u2013 \u201cNine in 10 university students in England have had at least one Covid jab\u201d \u2013 was stated as fact rather than attributed to the findings of a study.",

        "content": "If you don\u2019t agree with People magazine that the US actor is the sexiest man alive, there\u2019s something wrong with you\nHumanity finds itself at a low ebb. Years of entrenched division mean that we can no longer find a single thing to agree upon. We are happy to tear each other apart for the slightest ideological incursion, howling shrieks of outrage whenever anyone fails to slot into the narrow grid system of our increasingly binary worldview. It is a tragedy, but it doesn\u2019t have to be this way. What if a brave shining knight came charging in on a golden steed, presenting us with a truth so simple and undeniable that it could reunite all of humanity as we know it? Wouldn\u2019t that be amazing?\nWell, stop dreaming. The actor, screenwriter and producer Paul Rudd has just been named as the sexiest man alive. We are saved.\nPeople magazine, which has since 1985 compiled a forensically scrutinised sexiness ranking of all the world\u2019s men, has announced that Paul Rudd has finally done it. Out of all the men who are currently alive, Rudd is objectively sexier than all of them. Sexier than Michael B Jordan, who was named as the sexiest man alive last year. Sexier than John Legend, who was named as the sexiest man alive in 2019. Sexier than Chris Hemsworth, Bradley Cooper, Jude Law, Nick Nolte or John F Kennedy Jr, who were named as the sexiest men alive in 2014, 2011, 2004, 1992 and 1988 respectively. Sexier even than Johnny Depp, who was named as the sexiest man alive on two different occasions despite, you know, everything. All those hunky bimbos can get in the bin, because Paul Rudd just out-sexied the whole damn lot of them with one hand tied behind his back.\nIn response to his new award, Rudd told People: \u201cI\u2019m going to lean into it hard. I\u2019m going to own this. I\u2019m not going to try to be like: \u2018Oh, I\u2019m so modest\u2019. I\u2019m getting business cards made \u2026 I\u2019m hoping now that I\u2019ll finally be invited to some of those sexy dinners with Clooney and Pitt and B Jordan. And I figure I\u2019ll be on a lot more yachts\u201d. Which might sound as if he\u2019s exaggerating for comic effect. But he is not. Because Paul Rudd really is the sexiest man alive.\nRudd has always managed to be handsome in a manner that borders on the miraculous. Not only is there his seemingly supernatural inability to age \u2013 he is only five years younger than Nigel Farage, for instance, who has spent the last decade looking like the botched results of a scientific quest to fuse Crazy Frog with the concept of gout \u2013 but he also radiates dangerous levels of easygoing charm. There is no mysterious darkness to Paul Rudd. There is no hint that he would ever attempt to steal your wife even though everyone knows your wife would leave you for him in a second.\nAnd ever since he joined the Marvel payroll, Rudd\u2019s sexiness has only expanded. He\u2019s still the same goofball he always was, except that now he is contractually obliged to briefly show a six-pack onscreen once per movie. This newly showcased physical fitness means that Rudd has now achieved the rarefied status of four-quadrant sexiness. He\u2019s nice to look at. He has good hair. He\u2019s funny. He\u2019s weird enough to make an Ant-Man trailer that consists of nothing but he and Michael Douglas slapping their thighs and shouting the word \u201cants\u201d over and over with increasingly deranged intensity. This, ladies and gentlemen, is what the word sexy was created for.\nEven his relatively advanced years no longer matter. Rudd isn\u2019t the oldest sexiest man alive ever \u2013 Harrison Ford was 56 when he was awarded the title in 1998, and Sean Connery was 59 when he was crowned in 1989 \u2013 but who cares about the piffling matter of age? Rudd will be sexy when he\u2019s 70, and when he\u2019s 90. His body could be dug up by robots a thousand years from now and his ruined corpse would still be a thousand times sexier than you on your best day. Seriously, ask anyone if they have a crush on Paul Rudd, and the only people who will reply negatively are either liars or sociopaths.\nSure, you might find people who will claim that the entire notion of world\u2019s sexiest man is a sham, a half-baked publicist-assisted con job designed to boost the circulation of a wilting publication while amplifying the winner\u2019s latest project (Rudd\u2019s new Ghostbusters movie is released a week from now, coincidentally). But this isn\u2019t a time for cynicism. May we all swoon at his feet for ever.",

For a child who grew up a voracious reader of sword-and-sorcery genre fiction, directing a grimy fantasy game was a dream. I find a great sense of poetic satisfaction in the fact that Miyazaki \u2013 now in his mid 40s and the president of developer FromSoftware, having propelled the company to global success with his demanding, distinctive, haunting and unforgettable games Dark Souls, Bloodborne and Sekiro \u2013 has been working with George RR Martin on a fantasy game. It feels like a full-circle moment for the boy who, when he couldn\u2019t understand parts of the fantasy novels he brought home from his local library, used his own imagination to bridge the gaps.\nMartin\u2019s role on Elden Ring was completed some time ago \u2013 he workshopped the characters and their relationships, which Miyazaki and his team then integrated into the game. Aside from all the swords, Elden Ring bears almost no resemblance to Game of Thrones (it does have dragons, but if there is any complex politicking, skullduggery or mass-murder at weddings to be found here, it\u2019s later in the game than the five hours I played). This game is more fantastical: your character can summon ethereal blades and lightning strikes, characters talk in reverent jargon about \u201csites of grace\u201d and \u201cthe Tarnished\u201d, and your horse is a corporeal ghost. After learning the basics of attacking and defending yourself, you emerge into a world called the Lands Between, where eerily glowing trees extend into the sky like mountains, bathing the forested land below in golden light.\nFrom there the map is yours. A few steps outside the tutorial cave, I found a patronising monk sitting on top of a hill. Spotting an intimidating-looking knight on horseback down the obvious path in front of me, I shouldered a broadsword and headed around him instead, creeping through a wood where knights ambled around with lit torches. They led me to another cave full of wolves, at the end of which I found my first boss, a beastman: a shrieking, whirling tangle of pelts and blades. Miraculously, I finished him off on my first try \u2013 but then, flush with success, I thought I\u2019d have a go at that big mounted guy in the gleaming armour outside and swiftly got stomped to death. Ah. This is a FromSoftware game, after all. Fighting is brutal and strategic \u2013 no mashing a button and hoping for the best here. You have to be on your toes and ready for a guard or parry.\nWhat surprised me about Elden Ring is that it doesn\u2019t feel forbidding. As much as I love Miyazaki and FromSoftware\u2019s other games, I find them intensely stressful to play, at least the first time around. You never know what\u2019s down the next decrepit castle corridor or at the bottom of the next crumbling staircase, but you can be fairly sure that it will be horrible and it will probably kill you, leaving you with a daunting run back to where you were. In Elden Ring the sense of open space negates this somehow. I was intrigued rather than afraid of what I might find if I followed the light of a campfire, or hauled open a long-closed dungeon doorway, or summoned my steed and rode off towards an area of the world I hadn\u2019t yet explored. Being able to zip around the map also made a world of difference \u2013 there was no harrowing journey to be repeated over and over after meeting each of my inevitable demises.\nPerhaps this is 12 years\u2019 worth of Souls experience talking, but I also didn\u2019t find it off-puttingly difficult. Or at least not in the same way as FromSoftware\u2019s most recent game, the punishingly hard samurai-horror Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. Elden Ring\u2019s bosses are formidable, and I don\u2019t mind admitting that I got nowhere with the demo\u2019s final gatekeeper, Margit, a hideous giant with bits of tree growing out of his face, who has not only a giant sword and a scorpion\u2019s tail to smash you up with but also a magical dagger that he summons out of thin air, which really seems like overkill. But I was never ambushed by the challenge. I always knew when I was in a dangerous area or about to face a particularly hard opponent and, crucially, I could run away if I wanted to. This is more like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, in that you can get yourself into and out of trouble with delightful ease, escaping sticky situations and returning later when you\u2019re feeling braver.\nBreath of the Wild kept surfacing in my memory as I played Elden Ring, along with the 10-year-old Bethesda fantasy classic, Skyrim. At least in the previewed sections, this has a high-fantasy aesthetic vibe, with colour and light and gold-glinting sunshine in place of other Miyazaki games\u2019 oppressive, unrelenting darkness. And the way the world is laid out, with enticing structures just visible in the distance, and caves and catacombs and tucked-away little pockets of land that provide ideal hiding places for interesting creatures or treasure, encourages adventurousness and curiosity rather than hesitance and terror. Elden Ring has multiplayer: like in Dark Souls, you can summon other players to help you, or invade their worlds to duel them. I couldn\u2019t get it to work over the few days I had access to this demo, but because I didn\u2019t end up stuck on one particular boss or area, I was more than happy trying things out on my own.\nThere\u2019s also a minimalism to what\u2019s on screen that makes the imaginary world conjured here feel bigger, more absorbing. Your health and stamina bars and the icons showing your equipped weapons and items disappear when they\u2019re not needed, letting you concentrate on what you can see ahead of you, whether you\u2019re tearing across the landscape on your horned, spectral steed or crouched in long grass, creeping up on an encampment of soldiers. Don\u2019t get me wrong, there\u2019s an abundance of overwhelming information nestled in the menus \u2013 there are just so many stats and different items, all accompanied by opaque text descriptions that players will enjoy piecing together into comprehensible lore. But while you\u2019re playing, you are not bombarded with visual information.\nMargit, the gatekeeper to the castle at the edge of this section of Elden Ring\u2019s map, hides at the top of a windswept hill. To get to him, you have to make your way through barricades, past giants, and through some atmospherically terrible weather. I found a lake that was home to a dragon, and catacombs that spooked me too much to delve too deep. These sound like fantasy tropes, but there is nothing generic about Elden Ring\u2019s alluringly creepy and subversive art direction, or the way it makes you feel when you\u2019re fighting its creatures, sword in hand and heart in mouth. Exploring the Lands Between, I was struck by how much this felt like an adventure rather than a gauntlet. It\u2019s like a collision between two of my favourite games of the last decade \u2013 Dark Souls and Zelda: Breath of the Wild \u2013 and that is a comparison that should excite anyone.\nElden Ring is out 25 February 2022 on Xbox, Playstation 4/5 and PC; a network test version will be playable for selected players from 12-15 November.",

Meta, which also sells adverts on its Messenger app and to third-party apps through its audience network, made $86bn (\u00a364bn) in revenues last year. Nearly 2 billion people use the Facebook app every day.\nMeta acknowledged that the move could affect political groups and campaigning organisations, many of which use Facebook for fundraising.\n\u201cSome of our advertising partners have expressed concerns about these targeting options going away because of their ability to help generate positive societal change, while others understand the decision to remove them,\u201d said Mudd, who added that advocacy groups still had options on the platform for reaching people.\nHowever, advertisers on Meta platforms can continue to target billions of users based on a range of options such as age, gender, occupation and location. Meta is under scrutiny on both sides of the Atlantic over its record on keeping users safe following revelations by the whistleblower Frances Haugen, who has released tens of thousands of internal company documents.\nIn a quarterly report released on Tuesday, Meta said the prevalence of hate speech on Facebook had fallen for the fourth quarter in a row. In the third quarter of 2021, it was 0.03% or 3 views of hate speech per 10,000 views of content, down from 0.05% in the second quarter.",

        "content": "There is close scrutiny of the legal work the former attorney general does in addition to his tasks as an MP\nThe former attorney general Sir Geoffrey Cox is the MP currently in the spotlight amid a wider controversy about second jobs and outside interests, after it emerged that in his work as a QC he has been representing the British Virgin Islands (BVI), both from London and the Caribbean.\nIn a statement on Wednesday, the Torridge and West Devon MP insisted he had done nothing improper, and that his extensive outside work was \u201cno secret\u201d.\nNonetheless, Labour and the Lib Dems have demanded an inquiry into Cox\u2019s activities. Here are the main areas of controversy over his extra-parliamentary work:\nWhile MPs are allowed to have other jobs, they are not permitted to use parliamentary resources to do them. This was one of the charges upheld against Owen Paterson, the now-resigned Tory MP whose paid lobbying instigated the current fuss. Paterson held meetings connected to his lobbying in his Commons office, and used Commons stationery for some letters.\nFootage has emerged of Cox taking part virtually in hearings in which he represented the BVI over allegations of misgovernance and corruption. He appears to be doing so from his parliamentary office. At one point on 14 September Cox apologised for an absence, saying \u201cthe bell went off\u201d, thought to be an apparent reference to the division bell, which calls MPs to vote.\nOpposition parties want Kathryn Stone, the parliamentary commissioner for standards, to investigate what they believe is a breach of the rules. In his statement, Cox says he would accept Stone\u2019s verdict, but \u201cdoes not believe that he breached the rules\u201d.\nAs well as representing the BVI via video link, Cox represented its government and its premier, Andrew Fahie, in person in the Caribbean, in April, May and June this year, including periods when the Commons was sitting.\nCox took part in a number of votes while he was away, doing so via a proxy. Proxy voting was first introduced to the Commons in January 2019, initially just for new parents.\nIn June last year, amid Covid, the arrangement was extended for MPs who could not be in Westminster for medical or public health reasons, and then in November, to any MPs who preferred to not vote in person \u201cfor medical or public health reasons relating to the pandemic\u201d. This element expired in July this year.\nUnder the rules as set out, Cox would appear not be have been allowed to cast a proxy vote so he could do non-MP work. However, in his statement Cox said he \u201cconsulted the chief whip specifically on this issue and was advised that it was appropriate\u201d.\nDuring spring, restrictions on travelling abroad remained notably tougher than they are now. Overseas trips from England were only permitted with a \u201creasonable excuse\u201d.\nOne of these was travel for business \u201cwhere it is not reasonably possible to complete that work within the UK\u201d. Among examples listed were work linked to critical infrastructure, national security or diplomatic purposes.\nCox is likely to have a reasonable argument that his trip was necessary, both in terms of the difficulty of holding weeks of legal hearings remotely, and the fact he was representing a national government.\nCox\u2019s contribution to the register of MPs\u2019 interests shows significant hours devoted to Withers, the international law firm representing the BVI, with a continuing commitment from this month of up to 41 hours a month, or around 10 hours a week.\nIt does seem to be the case that Cox\u2019s contributions to the work of the Commons have been minimal since he took on the BVI case. From 1 April this year until now, Cox has spoken just three times in the chamber, according to Hansard, all on the same day, 13 September.\nHowever, as long as MPs do not break rules, for example on paid lobbying, there is in effect no limit on how much outside work they carry out, and it is up to their electors to decide. Cox makes this point in his statement, one he opted to voice in the third person: \u201cSir Geoffrey\u2019s view is that it is up to the electors of Torridge and West Devon whether or not they vote for someone who is a senior and distinguished professional in his field and who still practises that profession.\u201d",

Police said Von Bredow\u2019s body showed signs of torture.\nCommissioner Hugo Grance, the chief investigator of the local police, said four violins believed to have been made by the revered Italian luthier Antonio Stradivari were found in the possession of Volker Grannas, a 58-year-old German who lived near the Von Bredow residence.\nAlso arrested were Yves Asriel Spartacus Steinmetz, 60, and Chilean Stephen Jorg Messing Darchinger, 51. None had been formally charged yet, however, said prosecutor Lorena Ledesma.\nGrance said that Von Bredow apparently had left the violins with Grannas during a trip to Germany, and was told when he returned that they had been destroyed in a fire.\n\u201cOur principal hypothesis is that the motive for the double crime was to find the international certification of authenticity of the violins so they could be sold,\u201d he said.\nLedesma said officials were seeking further evidence because they suspect more people were involved.\n\u201cTo commit the crime and such a brutal murder it must be because they knew the victims. We\u2019ve found a lot of evidence,\u201d said Ledesma.\nViolins crafted by Stradivari in the 17th and 18th centuries can sell for millions of dollars.\nVon Bredow gained notice as a teenager when he discovered the complete skeleton of a mammoth near his home town of Siegsdorf in Bavaria. He later founded a museum on mammoths and also pursued work in biology, geology and other fields, according to the biography on his museum\u2019s website.\nNeighbors in Aregua said Von Bredow had settled in the town two years ago and dedicated himself to making violins.\nGrance said last week that Von Bredow\u2019s house \u201cwas found in complete disarray and blood stains indicated that the Germans were probably killed elsewhere on the property. The man had traces of having been tortured,\u201d Grance added.\nThe officer said the evidence at the scene indicates \u201cthat two or more individuals sought something\u201d inside the house.",

The reopening of the markets is part of that narrative, even as data shows the health emergency is far from over.\nTighter controls had been announced to allow Christmas markets to go ahead, with organisers expected to monitor visitors\u2019 entry in some cases by putting fencing around venues, and with many markets due to insist on vaccine certificates or proof of recovery from coronavirus.\nMarket stalls are to be erected with more distance between them, and the numbers allowed in are to be restricted. Organisers and health authorities have issued appeals for visitors to use common sense, keep their distance from other market-goers and to wear masks.\nBut now authorities from Bavaria in the south to Saxony and Thuringia in the east have begun announcing the cancellation of many scheduled markets, saying a rising infection rate means it would be irresponsible for them to go ahead.\nBerlin\u2019s Charlottenburg Palace market was cancelled after its operator said enforcing mask-wearing, as well as an alcohol ban in place owing to its location in a public park under the German capital\u2019s infection protection law, made the event impossible to hold.\nThe market\u2019s Tommy Erbe told German media: \u201cOnce again, politics has failed to create clear and real conditions for organisers in time.\u201d\nNuremberg, one of the country\u2019s most popular markets, is due to go ahead but its opening ceremony will only take place online. Other cities such as Dortmund have cancelled their Christmas lights ceremonies, arguing that health and safety regulations had made events too costly to hold.\nHolger Zastrow, the head of the Augustustmarkt in Dresden, due to open on 24 November, said he remained optimistic it would go ahead. \u201cAt 500 metres long, our market has the longest promenade of any in Germany, and we will open,\u201d he told German media. \u201cEverything is so spread out that it is not necessary to carry out controls, whether of tests or vaccine passports.\u201d\nGermany\u2019s Weihnachtsm\u00e4rkte do not only contribute to the seasonal spirit \u2013 offering families and parties of office workers up and down the country the chance to get into the festive mood with everything from Gl\u00fchwein and roast chestnuts to a range of arts and crafts and fairground amusements \u2013 they are also huge business. Typically they attract more than 150 million visitors a year, including many tourists from abroad, and generate about \u20ac3bn (\u00a32.6bn) in revenue annually. They normally open from mid- to late November until just before Christmas.\nThe virologist Christian Drosten, a leading German voice throughout the pandemic, warned in his regular podcast on coronavirus on Tuesday, in an episode titled SOS \u2013 Iceberg Ahead, that Germany faced an escalation that would be hard to control and lead to tens of thousands of additional deaths if authorities did not reintroduce tighter measures, including contact restrictions.\n\u201cWe need to be able to control infection activity again, and testing is not an adequate way of doing that. The tests are viewed as an emergency brake, to break the wave, but there is no way they will do that.\u201d\nPrevious waves, Drosten said, had shown that the only way to lower the incidence rate was a change in the behaviour of the entire population. \u201cWhen people change their behaviour and take the threat more seriously, that has an effect,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are in an emergency situation.\u201d He said the most effective way of ending the pandemic was for the entire population to have received three vaccination shots, though he admitted it was an unrealistic prospect.\nThere has been much focus in Germany in recent days on neighbouring Denmark, which had announced its pandemic was over last month but which has reintroduced restrictions this week over a rise in cases, and on Austria, which has managed to considerably boost the number of people willing to receive a vaccine by introducing strict so-called 2G rules, meaning that only those who are vaccinated or recovered can take part in many activities such as visiting cinemas or hairdressers. Germany is also debating a mandatory vaccine for people working in certain fields such as care homes and hospitals.",

Sign up now!\nThe Fiver has lost count of the amount of times we\u2019ve sharpened our pencil and taken aim at the Premier League for not having rules robust enough to stop nefarious forces flooding into the English top flight. Vulture capitalists? Hello. Online betting companies? Show us the money. Blood-soaked regimes? The washing machine is right over there. So imagine our surprise when the powers that be pointed to their rulebook to make it clear what they were not willing to tolerate: teams wearing away kits at home. For charidee. Yep, well done Richard Masters and co \u2013 what a show of strength!\nIt stems from an approach to the Premier League by Shelter, the organisation campaigning to end homelessness in England, asking for its support for #NoHomeKit. \u201cThe idea is simple but powerful: this Boxing Day, clubs and fans ditch their home colours for their away or third kit, showing support for people who don\u2019t have a safe home.\u201d It\u2019s a brilliant proposal and a cause that even our mean-spirited relatives would support. You\u2019d think it was an open goal for an organisation up to its elbows in bad publicity after the Newcastle takeover.\nBut nope, here\u2019s a faceless suit, perhaps dressed like Scrooge, with a view from their paymasters. \u201cThe Premier League receives a large number of requests from charities every season, however we aren\u2019t able to support all centrally,\u201d they blabbed. \u201cClubs are entitled to support charitable causes, and we encourage clubs to do so, provided it is in compliance with Premier League rules.\u201d Those rules state home teams must wear home kits as their first priority. The backlash was understandably swift. \u201cThe Premier League have obviously got no heart,\u201d roared Trevor Sinclair, while Gary Neville \u2013 who has helped house homeless people in his Manchester hotel \u2013 also took aim, damning it with comparisons to the PM. \u201cImagine refusing a request to raise money and awareness for homelessness,\u201d he sighed. \u201cA Johnson-like U-turn on its way if the clubs push hard.\u201d\nThe only good to come out of the iron-hearted decision so far is that it has arguably given Shelter\u2019s campaign more publicity in the run-up to Christmas than it would have received had the Premier League done the right thing and said yes. The Fiver\u2019s not always the most charitable, but we\u2019ll be getting right behind Shelter by plucking our dusty Dukla Prague away kit out of the attic and donating some of our soft-earned to a vital cause. We might even dig deep to buy Premier League suits a moral compass for Christmas.

But it seems the list of joint experiences may also include coronavirus infections.\nExperts say they have detected the first case in the UK of a pet dog catching coronavirus, apparently from its owners. The canine\u2019s infection was confirmed after testing on 3 November.\nIt is not the first time that pets have tested positive for the virus; the same laboratory detected coronavirus in a cat last year, while research from the Netherlands has previously suggested that the virus is common in cats and dogs owned by people who have Covid.\nSome experts have suggested owners with Covid should avoid their pets to prevent spreading the virus to them, and have raised concerns the animals could act as a reservoir of the virus, potentially passing it back to humans.\nThe UK\u2019s chief veterinary officer, Dr Christine Middlemiss, said coronavirus was confirmed in a pet dog in the UK after tests at the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) laboratory in Weybridge, Surrey.\n\u201cThe infected dog was undergoing treatment for another unrelated condition and is recovering,\u201d she said.\nHowever, it seems owners need not be too worried. \u201cIt is very rare for dogs to be infected and they will usually only show mild clinical signs and recover within a few days. There is no clear evidence to suggest that pets directly transmit the virus to humans,\u201d said Middlemiss. \u201cWe will continue to monitor this situation closely and will update our guidance to pet owners should the situation change.\u201d\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also suggests there is little risk of catching Covid from a pet. \u201cBased on the available information to date, the risk of animals spreading Covid-19 to people is considered to be low,\u201d it states.\nHowever it appears transmission can, at least sometimes, go the other way. \u201cCovid-19 is predominantly spread from person to person, but in some situations the virus can spread from people to animals,\u201d said Dr Katherine Russell, consultant epidemiologist at the UK Health Security Agency.\n\u201cIn line with general public health guidance, you should wash your hands regularly, including before and after contact with animals,\u201d she said.\nProf Rowland Kao, of the University of Edinburgh, said there was little sign that coronavirus infections in dogs were of concern.\n\u201cIn order [for these infections in dogs] to be important for transmission there has to be contact, and production of virus,\u201d he said. \u201cIf dogs were getting seriously infected often, we probably would have seen it before now. The fact that it hasn\u2019t happened that much yet, with so much infection and so many people at home with their pets [suggests] it\u2019s probably not an issue.\u201d\nKao added that to be a reservoir of the virus, dogs would need to circulate the virus amongst themselves, for example in kennels \u2013 although Kao said dogs may not yet have returned in large numbers. \u201cIf they have, and we still haven\u2019t seen much infection transmission, again it would seem to make it unlikely,\u201d he said.\nCats and dogs are not the only animals to have caught coronavirus. \u201cMore recently, a big study has shown that white-tailed deer are probably circulating it among themselves in the US,\u201d said Kao.\nOutbreaks of coronavirus on mink farms led to mass culling of the animals in countries including Denmark, with the World Health Organization warning in February that there was a high risk of introduction and the spread of the coronavirus from fur farming to humans.\nThe CDC says mink to human transmission has been reported in countries including the Netherlands, Denmark, and Poland, adding there is a possibility of mink spreading the virus to people on mink farms.\nBut, the agency notes: \u201cCurrently, there is no evidence that mink play a significant role in the spread of Sars-CoV-2 to people.\u201d\nProf James Wood, the head of the department of veterinary medicine at Cambridge University, said there was increasing evidence that asymptomatic and undetected infection of dogs and cats in households with human cases were actually quite common.\nBut he added: \u201cThe fact that they are common, perhaps counterintuitively, combined with their very rare real-time detection emphasises that they are generally not at all serious,\u201d he said.\n\u201cDetailed risk assessments and understandings of these findings suggest that the risk of onward transmission to other pets or humans from dogs and cats is highly unlikely to occur. There is absolutely no suggestion that our pet animals will become reservoirs in the way that ferrets and white-tailed deer in Iowa have become.\u201d",

The protesters had also called for that law to be scrapped.\n\u201cIf we allow the first, second and third defendant and their networks to keep doing this action, it will not be long to lead to the overthrow of the constitutional monarchy,\u201d said the judge, Chiranit Havanond, according to AFP.\nSunai Phasuk, a senior researcher with Human Rights Watch, described the ruling as \u201cessentially a judicial coup\u201d that could pave the way for further legal cases against protesters, who could be accused of treason.\n\u201cBy asserting that sovereign power belongs to the monarchy not the people, this puts an end to Thailand\u2019s constitutional monarchy rule and replaces it with absolutism,\u201d he said.\nThe court did not impose a penalty on the three protest leaders, as it was instead ruling on the constitutionality of their demands. All three deny seeking to overthrow the monarchy, according to their lawyer, Krisadang Nutcharut.\n\u201cIf you actually give the time and opportunity for these young people to elaborate and make their arguments, they would say that these demands for monarchy reform would actually make the monarchy more safe and secure under the democratic regime that we have,\u201d said Krisadang.\nEvidence submitted by the defence was not examined by the court, according to Krisadang, who said this had prompted him and Panusaya to walk out of the hearing. Arnon and Panupong are in pre-trial detention over separate charges related to protests and were not permitted to attend the session.\nSince last year\u2019s protests, at least 156 people have been charged under the lese majesty law, including 12 minors, the youngest aged 14, according to Thai Lawyers for Human Rights. Twenty-four protesters have been denied bail and remain in pre-trial detention for their political activities.\nAn online petition recently set up by protest groups to call for an end to lese majesty has attracted more than 210,000 signatures.\nProtests have dwindled in number since 2020, partly owing to Covid outbreaks and the increased use of legal charges against activists.\nSunai said it remained to be seen how the protesters would respond to the verdict. \u201cBy making peaceful expression impossible, I am worried Thailand is now at a very dangerous juncture as a result of the constitutional court ruling. Instead of stabilising the country, Thailand is heading towards a dangerous chaos,\u201d he said.\nOn Twitter, FreeYouth, a key protest group, shared an image with the message \u201cJust say it clearly that this country is governed by absolute monarchy\u201d. It added: \u201cThe judgment will burn its own system.\u201d",

Once the TGA has scrutinised the data, and if it is satisfied with it, it may grant Evusheld \u201cprovisional approval\u201d for use in Australia in limited circumstances. Further data must be collected and given to the TGA even if this occurs.\nThis treatment consists of two laboratory-made antibodies, tixagevimab and cilgavimab. These antibodies bind to the spike protein of the virus, stopping the virus from entering the body\u2019s cells and causing an infection.\nBecause each of the antibodies attach to different parts of the protein, using them in combination may be more effective than using either alone. It is also hoped this will offer good protection against variants, since the virus would have to mutate in multiple ways to escape both antibodies\u2019 actions.\nEvusheld is being considered for use as a Covid-19 preventive in Australians aged 18 years and older. In August, AstraZeneca released the results of a trial of the treatment involving 5,197 participants from the US, UK, Spain, France and Belgium who did not have Covid-19. Seventy-five per cent of participants had comorbidities, including medical conditions that often mean vaccination is weak or ineffective. Two-thirds of participants received Evusheld, and the rest were given a placebo.\nThe trial found Evusheld reduced the risk of developing symptomatic Covid-19 by 77% compared to the placebo. There were no cases of severe Covid-19 or related deaths in those given Evusheld. In the placebo group, there were three cases of severe Covid-19, which included two deaths.\nThe results now need to be replicated more widely in further trials, which is why regulators such as the TGA require AstraZeneca to submit ongoing data.\nNo. A vaccine trains the body\u2019s immune system to respond to the virus if a person becomes infected in the future. Evusheld provides antibodies directly to the body via two intra-muscular injections administered consecutively. It immediately targets and neutralises the virus, preventing the virus from entering cells and causing an infection in the first place.\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nIf approved, Evusheld will be the first long-acting antibody available for Covid-19 prevention in vulnerable populations who are unable to mount an adequate immune response to the virus from vaccination alone, for example people with cancer, and some elderly people.\nAssociate Prof Nada Hamad, a haematologist in Sydney, said Evusheld and similar treatments under development are designed to fill a gap left by vaccines, and by antibody treatments like Sotrovimab.\nSotrovimab is given to people already diagnosed with Covid-19 who are at high risk of developing severe disease. Sotrovimab needs to be administered early after someone is diagnosed to be effective.\n\u201cBut Sotrovimab is very short-acting,\u201d Hamad said. \u201cIt just lasts as we wait for the virus to dissipate. Once you get over the virus, the treatment doesn\u2019t hang around in your body.\n\u201cEvusheld is a longer-acting antibody, and the hope is it will prevent the infection.\u201d\nClinical trials to date show Evusheld may provide six to 12 months of protection from the virus. This is significantly shorter than vaccines. Even though the protection offered by vaccines does slowly wane over time, they are still effective at preventing severe disease, death and hospitalisation months down the track.\n\u201cEvusheld and similar treatments being examined should be seen as a major advancement in protecting the very vulnerable, but not a vaccine alternative,\u201d Hamad said.\nEvusheld also takes longer to administer, is more expensive, needs to be given by a trained doctor or nurse, and patients may need longer monitoring afterwards than the 15 minutes required for a vaccine.

        "content": "Study says some individuals clear virus rapidly due to a strong immune response from existing T-cells, meaning tests record negative result\nWe all know that person who, despite their entire household catching Covid-19, has never tested positive for the disease. Now scientists have found an explanation, showing that a proportion of people experience \u201cabortive infection\u201d in which the virus enters the body but is cleared by the immune system\u2019s T-cells at the earliest stage meaning that PCR and antibody tests record a negative result.\nAbout 15% of healthcare workers who were tracked during the first wave of the pandemic in London, England, appeared to fit this scenario.\nThe discovery could pave the way for a new generation of vaccines targeting the T-cell response, which could produce much longer lasting immunity, scientists said.\nLeo Swadling, an immunologist at University College London and lead author of the paper, said: \u201cEveryone has anecdotal evidence of people being exposed but not succumbing to infection. What we didn\u2019t know is whether these individuals really did manage to completely avoid the virus or whether they naturally cleared the virus before it was detectable by routine tests.\u201d\nThe latest study intensively monitored healthcare workers for signs of infection and immune responses during the first wave of the pandemic. Despite a high risk of exposure 58 participants did not test positive for Covid-19 at any point. However, blood samples taken from these people showed they had an increase in T-cells that reacted against Covid-19, compared with samples taken before the pandemic took hold and compared with people who had not been exposed to the virus at all. They also had increases in another blood marker of viral infection.\nThe work suggests that a subset of people already had memory T-cells from previous infections from other seasonal coronaviruses causing common colds, which protected them from Covid-19.\nThese immune cells \u201csniff out\u201d proteins in the replication machinery \u2013 a region of Covid-19 shared with seasonal coronaviruses \u2013 and in some people this response was quick and potent enough for the infection to be cleared at the earliest stage. \u201cThese pre-existing T-cells are poised ready to recognise SARS-CoV-2,\u201d said Swadling.\nThe study adds to the known spectrum of possibilities after exposure to Covid-19, ranging from escaping infection entirely to severe disease.\nAlexander Edwards, associate professor in biomedical technology at the University of Reading, said: \u201cThis study identifies [a new] intermediate outcome \u2013 enough virus exposure to activate part of your immune system but not enough to experience symptoms, detect significant levels of virus or mount an antibody response.\u201d\nThe finding is particularly significant because the T-cell arm of the immune response tends to confer longer lasting immunity, typically of years rather than months, compared with antibodies. Nearly all existing Covid-19 vaccines focus on priming antibodies against the vital spike protein that helps SARS-CoV-2 enter cells. These neutralising antibodies give excellent protection against severe illness. However, the immunity wanes over time and a potential weakness of spike-based vaccines is that this region of the virus is known to mutate.\nBy contrast, the T-cell response does not tend to fade as quickly and the internal replication machinery that it targets is highly conserved across coronaviruses, meaning a vaccine that also targeted this region would probably protect against new strains \u2013 and possibly even against entirely new pathogens.\n\u201cInsights from this study could be critical in design of a different type of vaccine,\u201d said Edwards. \u201cA vaccine that primes T-cell immunity against different viral protein targets that are shared between many different coronaviruses would complement our spike vaccines that induce neutralising antibodies. Because these are components within the virus, antibodies are less effective \u2013 instead, T-cells come into play.\u201d",

        "content": "Study on mice found palmitic acid promoted metastasis in mouth and skin cancers\nScientists have shown how a fatty acid found in palm oil can encourage the spread of cancer, in work that could pave the way for new treatments.\nThe study, on mice, found that palmitic acid promoted metastasis in mouth and skin cancers. In future, this process could be targeted with drugs or carefully designed eating plans, but the team behind the work cautioned against patients putting themselves on diets in the absence of clinical trials.\n\u201cThere is something very special about palmitic acid that makes it an extremely potent promoter of metastasis,\u201d said Prof Salvador Aznar-Benitah, of the Institute for Research in Biomedicine (IRB), Barcelona. \u201cI think it is too early to determine which type of diet could be consumed by patients with metastatic cancer that would slow down the metastatic process.\u201d\nThe study adds to emerging evidence that diet can be used to enhance existing cancer treatments because certain nutrients are disproportionately relied on by tumour cells, or are required at critical stages such as metastasis.\nThe study built on previous work by the same team showing that, within a tumour, just a small subset of cells have the capacity to spread by travelling out of the tumour, reaching other organs and colonising them. These specialised cancer cells appeared to rely particularly heavily on fatty acids and the latest work narrowed this down to palmitic acid, which is found in palm oil \u2013 but also in a wide variety of foods such as butter and olive oil.\nThe study, published in Nature, found that when palmitic acid was supplemented into the diet of mice, mouth and skin cancers were more likely to spread. Other fatty acids called oleic acid and linoleic acid \u2013 omega-9 and omega-6 fats found in foods such as olive oil and flaxseeds \u2013 did not show the same effect. Neither of the fatty acids tested increased the risk of developing cancer in the first place.\nThe study suggested that exposure to palmitic acid caused changes to the function of genes in cancer cells that allowed them to sense fatty acids and consume them more efficiently. The presence of palmitic acid also appeared to send cancer cells into a \u201cregenerative state\u201d allowing them to form signalling networks beyond the tumour, which is known to be a crucial step towards spreading.\nMetastasis of cancer remains the main cause of death in cancer patients and the vast majority of people with metastatic cancer can only be treated, but not cured.\nBy understanding what cancer cells need to make this leap, the scientists also identified ways to block the process and are planning a clinical trial of proteins that interfere with the tumour response to palmitic acid.\n\u201cThat is a much more realistic approach in terms of a real therapy, that doesn\u2019t depend on whether a patient likes Nutella or pizza,\u201d said Aznar-Benitah. \u201cPlaying with diets is so complicated.\u201d\nProf Greg Hannon, director of the Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute, said: \u201cThis is a rigorous and comprehensive study that suggests that exposure to a major constituent of palm oil durably changes the behaviour of cancer cells, making them more prone to progress from local to potentially lethal metastatic disease. Given the prevalence of palm oil as an ingredient in processed foods, this study provides strong motivation for further study on how dietary choices influence the risk of tumour progression.\u201d\nHelen Rippon, chief executive at Worldwide Cancer Research, said: \u201cThis discovery is a huge breakthrough in our understanding of how diet and cancer are linked and, perhaps more importantly, how we can use this knowledge to start new cures for cancer. Metastasis is estimated to be responsible for 90% of all cancer deaths \u2013 that\u2019s around 9 million deaths a year globally. Learning more about what makes cancer spread and \u2013 importantly \u2013 how to stop it is the way forward to reduce these numbers.\u201d",

Instead of thinking of these things as providentially ordained, there is hope to be found by recalling how they were made by ordinary hands.\nImagine that today all new judges were appointed by Dominic Raab. Yet, for us, the independent appointment of judges is quite new. It was wrested from the grip of the lord chancellor during the Blair government, and as a headhunter I played a part in that. (I led the search work to recruit the first Judicial Appointments Commission and, more significantly, its vital, little-remembered predecessor: the body which in a brief life blew apart the lord chancellor\u2019s cosy club.)\nWhen I started work in the civil service, I was taught that fundamental principles like appointment on merit, with no chumocracy, were created during the Crimean war. Our predecessors learned what the rule by cronies of the powerful had cost in terms of unnecessary deaths. They had had enough. They invented a new concept of public administration. They changed their minds about who, and what, deserved respect.\nThis \u201csceptred isle\u201d needs a new Crimean moment. Let\u2019s choose to have one.Douglas Board Visiting professor, University of Chichester\n Nesrine Malik\u2019s depiction of the way cynicism can flourish in a country like this is timely. The urgency now is around how to arrest the decline and restore voters\u2019 belief that their participation at the ballot box is worthwhile. That only becomes possible if there is even the slightest belief that things are capable of changing.\nAnd in the current mire, if opposition parties cannot even provide a spark of hope which might inspire us to believe that change is possible, then the direction of travel is bleak indeed. Robust and sustained calling-out of corrupt practices, corrupt individuals and, above all, demands for restitution where possible, are vital prerequisites if the rot is to be stopped. Dr Peter Mangan Beckenham, London\n It is with sadness and shame that I concur with Nesrine Malik\u2019s searing analysis. I once believed that my country, with all its failings and injustices, had endeavoured over the past 60 years or so to improve the lot of all through its commitment to the NHS, the welfare state and improving social justice. Once I believed that my government spoke with \u201cgood faith\u201d and that it did at least intend to speak the truth. Once I believed that when I died, I would leave behind a better and fairer country than the one I entered in the 1940s.\nNow I believe that this government, with its frequent reneging on explicit promises and agreements, its rejection of genuine honest debate, its distortion of facts, and our prime minister\u2019s propensity to bully and flout every rule of good governance, is gradually unravelling the achievements of all the previous postwar administrations. If we continue on this path, it will inevitably lead to Britain being justifiably compared with Malik\u2019s \u201cfailed states overseas\u201d.

Sinstadt, born in 1930, was the only child of shopkeepers in Folkestone and was evacuated during the second world war. Later, reflecting on the tragic death of the pair in a German air raid, he said: \u201cI can still remember my teacher taking me out of class to tell me the news. I have wondered what might have been if my parents had survived. Who knows, I may have followed my dad and become a shopkeeper.\u201d\nThe young Sinstadt made his first live commentary in 1949 for forces radio after his conscription into national service and was rewarded with a 7-6 cup game between an English and Scottish regiment.\n\u201cThe game made my job easy and I thought: \u2018Hang on, I can do this,\u2019\u201d recalled Sinstadt. \u201cUnfortunately, I soon realised you couldn\u2019t just turn up on the day and hope for the best. If you don\u2019t do your proper research the listener will soon catch you out.\u201d\nAfter time on BBC radio and Anglia Television, Sinstadt\u2019s informed but distinctively dry style became a feature of Granada TV\u2019s Kick Off preview and of highlights shows on ITV from 1969 to 1981 when he became the station\u2019s full-time football commentator. Sinstadt described the iconic moment Denis Law scored a cheeky backheel goal for Manchester City as his former club Manchester United were relegated to the then second division.\nA cultured man with a passion for opera, he worked on programmes covering that art form as well as branching out to commentate on golf for Channel 4 when he left Granada TV before returning to the BBC in the mid-1980s to become a regular on Match of the Day, Football Focus and Final Score until his retirement.\nSinstadt settled in the Potteries after his retirement and wrote a weekly column for the Stoke Sentinel until 2019.",

In order to protect the investigation, and in the interests of justice, we cannot comment further.\u201d\nWanjiru was last seen one evening in March 2012 with a British soldier from the military base and her body was found about two months later.\nRose Wanyua, Wanjiru\u2019s eldest sister, told the Guardian: \u201cIt\u2019s painful, very painful. Shiru did not deserve to die the way she did. We will never forget her.\u201d\n  Wanyua disputes the assumption that her sister met the soldiers while looking for clients as a sex worker. \u201cA friend told my sister that there was some \u2018quick money\u2019 to be made that evening if only Wanjiru joined her in entertaining the Johnnies in town. She was a hair stylist who used to make my daughters\u2019 hair, never the prostitute as many would like the world to believe,\u201d she said.\nThe UK high commissioner to Kenya, Jane Marriott, last month expressed \u201coutrage and concern\u201d over Wanjiru\u2019s death and promised high-level support for a Kenyan investigation into her murder.\nNoordin Haji, Kenya\u2019s director of public prosecutions, has said the government would request the soldier\u2019s extradition to face murder charges in Kenya.\nSince Kenya gained independence in 1963, the British Army Training Unit Kenya (BATUK) on the outskirts of Nanyuki has been beset by controversies and allegations of offences, although some see it as bringing benefits, both to the local economy and to the society through the soldiers\u2019 development work.",

We asked for their immediate reactions to the draft negotiation outcome published on Wednesday morning.\nOne secret negotiator said:\nThe draft covering decisions text has not come up to the global great expectations. The whole world wants a more ambitious outcome at Glasgow Cop26. But the draft covering decisions text waters down those ambitions and is not consistent with Paris agreement 1.5C goal, nor with raising ambitions [on cutting emissions].\nThe hope is that we have still two more days to raise mitigation [emissions-cutting] ambitions, deliver $100bn (\u00a374bn) [that was promised from] 2020 and $100bn-plus for beyond 2025, fix article 6 rules for market mechanisms, set adaptation goals and support national adaptation plans and operationalise Santiago Network for loss and damage.\nThe world needs a Marshall plan to face the climate emergency humanity is now facing. We can\u2019t let Glasgow Cop26 fail to rescue the most vulnerable now on the hook of adverse impacts of runaway climate change.\nAnother said:\nThe IPCC [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] report is very clear, and the cover decision [summary of aims] needs to reiterate the messages from the IPCC report, acknowledge the gap between emissions pledges and the emissions cuts needed, and call on parties to fill the gap. Parties need to submit NDCs [nationally determined contributions] by 2022.\nWe also need clear language on doubling adaptation finance, and on solidarity and support from developed countries. The link between finance for developing countries and their ability to have higher ambition on cutting emissions by 2030 [which would result from that finance] is also not made clear.\nAnother said:\nTo be honest, the text is devoid of any real ambition on finance and adaptation, especially in the context of the motto of keeping the 1.5C alive. Furthermore, it seems to be a sign of sobering realisation that all the hype around Cop26 and gloss is fading and fading fast.\nThere seems to be some mad scramble now to kick the can on many issues down the road into next year. The so-called UK leadership does not seem to be present.\nAnother told the Guardian:\nThere need to be stronger words on reducing emissions in the near term, especially from developed countries, and much more than the current vague acknowledgments that more finance is needed.\nA serious deal that bridges the emissions gap to achieve a path to limit warming to 1.5C must also bridge the financial gaps that are needed for developing countries to both adapt to climate change and leapfrog the fossil fuel age. Ambitious mitigation must go hand in hand with ambitious financial support to achieve this. Anything less will condemn billions to needless suffering.\nAnother developing country negotiator said:\n\u201cTo have any chance of reaching the 1.5C target, we must have a framework that consistently encourages countries to raise ambitions, and a five-year common timeframe is the best way to do this. The current NDC commitments already have us on a 2.4C temperature rise. A five-year common timeframe allows the review and assessment of how we are doing and forces a course of action.\nDespite the publicity created by pledges made last week, there are still huge leaps that must be taken if Cop26 is to be a success on climate finance. As well as the highly publicised failure to meet the $100bn target, which was intended as a floor, there are a number of other key issues.\nAt present, there is an imbalance in the prioritisation of mitigation finance over investment in adaptation. For the developing world, the need to scale up adaptation financing is urgent. Yet sticking points for developed nations continue to grind negotiations to a halt.\nRefusals to commit to concrete financial targets, inabilities to discuss the definition of climate finance and stubbornness on the share of proceeds issue under article 6.2 are all contributing to an increasing disillusionment with this negotiation process among developing nations.",

        "content": "England\u2019s attempt to unite the white-ball belts ended in Abu Dhabi with them on the canvas, bewildered and then beaten by a succession of vicious blows from Jimmy Neesham and Daryl Mitchell as a spellbinding game reached a brutal conclusion. Between them they simply pulverised England\u2019s death bowling as, at the end of an evening when batters consistently struggled to time the ball and find the boundary, everything suddenly clicked. In the end New Zealand cantered to victory by five wickets with an over to spare.\nDefeat will sting, of course, and it will be little consolation to Eoin Morgan\u2019s side that they contributed to a slow-burning thriller of a semi-final, a match that teetered compellingly on a knife-edge throughout.\nIt was not until the 16th over of the second innings that either side seemed to grab the game, and at that point it was England who briefly took control as Liam Livingstone ended his allocation by leaking just three and taking the wicket of Glenn Phillips. At that point their opponents needed an apparently far-fetched 57 from 24, and Neesham was fresh to the crease.\nNew Zealand immediately ripped the game right back out of their grasp again, and this time there was to be no comeback. Chris Jordan, England\u2019s one genuine death-overs specialist, was completely marmalised by Neesham in the following over. It turned into England\u2019s most expensive of the tournament, 23 runs coming off it including a couple of wides, and by its end it looked the Kiwis\u2019 game. Neesham fell to the last ball of the 18th over but it hardly mattered, given what Mitchell was about to do to Chris Woakes. He had never scored an international T20 half-century, but ended the most important game of his life unbeaten on 72 off 47 balls.\nAfter the 50-over World Cup and the World Test Championship, New Zealand have now made three finals in three years in three formats, an extraordinary achievement. They have also brought to an end a run of high-profile defeats to England, and though they had promised that memories of their gut-wrenching defeat on boundary countback in the 2019 World Cup final would not be on their minds there was some poetic justice in Neesham, who faced all but one ball of New Zealand\u2019s super over that day, returning to all but decide this match.\nIt was a night when New Zealand\u2019s core strategy of prioritising bowling depth, restricting their opponents\u2019 run-scoring and leaving themselves a chaseable target worked to perfection, albeit after a little more drama than they might have liked. Meanwhile England\u2019s decision to replace the injured Jason Roy with Sam Billings and bolster their batting, however well the formula has worked over recent years, looked decidedly unwise as the 30-year-old did not face a ball and their death bowling was mercilessly punished.\nEngland\u2019s minds might drift back to the moment, halfway through Jordan\u2019s decisively expensive over, when Jonny Bairstow executed a phenomenal catch on the boundary and, knowing he was heading over the rope, tossed the ball to Livingstone. England celebrated a brilliant relay catch but Bairstow seemed strangely half-hearted, and sure enough replays showed his knee making contact with the boundary padding just before he released the ball. In a game of tight margins perhaps this was the decisive moment, for all that New Zealand\u2019s victory was hard-fought and ultimately comprehensive.\nHaving won the toss and inevitably chosen to field, their long bowling attack slowly coiled around England\u2019s batters from the start, restricting their freedom and their scoring. Bairstow, promoted to open in Roy\u2019s absence, looked unsettled at the top of the order, hitting two boundaries including one off the inside edge in his 17-ball 13, and Dawid Malan\u2019s was a very Dawid Malan innings: loitering at around a run a ball for a while before accelerating, particularly strong on the cover drive. But when he truly tried to motor he crashed, heaving Tim Southee for six and then edging the next as he attempted a repeat. In between England had to come to terms with the shock of Jos Buttler doing only moderately well, before being trapped lbw by Ish Sodhi.\nInstead Moeen Ali provided the backbone of their innings, scoring his third T20 half-century and cementing his status among the key players in a team that ignored him for the best part of two years before welcoming him back in 2020. But the feeling at the halfway stage was that England had been pedestrian for long periods, had not made use of their fabled batting depth and had reached a score that was no more than par.\nMartin Guptill, probably the batter England feared the most, fell to the third ball of New Zealand\u2019s innings and when Kane Williamson followed not long after the Kiwis were 13 for two. They needed a partnership, and Devon Conway joined Mitchell to provide one.\nThey, too, found timing difficult \u2013 after five overs together both were still going at just under a run a ball \u2013 but they offered few chances and looked ominously set when Conway was stumped off Livingstone in the 14th over. At that stage England seemed to be ahead on points, but New Zealand and Neesham were about to land the knockout blow.",

I understand the suffering of the victims. I am trying in my answers [to the court] to give confirmation that everything was done.\u201d\nHollande appeared in court on Thursday to testify at France\u2019s biggest ever criminal trial over the attacks by Islamic State on 13 November 2015, which killed 130 people and injured more than 400 in synchronised suicide bombings and mass shootings across the French capital.\nThe killing began at about 9pm that Friday night, when a suicide bomber blew himself up after failing to get into the Stade de France for a France v Germany friendly football match, which Hollande was attending. Then came drive-by shootings and suicide bombings at cafes and restaurants. Finally, three gunmen entered the Bataclan during an Eagles of Death Metal gig, killing 90 people.\nThere has been anger from some victims\u2019 families that a jihadist commando was able to evade detection while preparing the biggest atrocities seen on French soil since the second world war.\nHollande insisted that the intelligence services had \u201cdone all they could\u201d to \u201cidentify and neutralise\u201d threats.\nFrench officials had known for months that the country could be a target, Hollande told the court. He said it was even known that IS extremists were entering disguised as refugees. \u201cBut we did not know where, when or how they would strike us,\u201d he added.\nAll nine gunmen died, either shot by police or by blowing themselves up. A total of 20 men are on trial accused of providing planning and logistical support. Six will be tried in their absence; five are presumed dead in Iraq or Syria and one is in prison in Turkey. The chief defendant in the trial is Salah Abdeslam, who is alleged to have been part of the team of attackers but discarded a malfunctioning explosive vest and fled home to Belgium.\nDuring the attack on the Bataclan gig, gunmen had shouted that it was Hollande\u2019s fault and that they were seeking revenge for France\u2019s airstrikes on Syria.\nHollande dismissed the attackers\u2019 speeches about him as \u201ca text learnt by heart, a kind of signature, as if the people who ordered the attacks had said that was the message that should be given\u201d.\nHe said he didn\u2019t believe the attackers had struck France because of French military intervention. \u201cThis group struck us not for our actions abroad, but for our ways of life at home,\u201d he said. \u201cDemocracy will always be stronger than barbarism.\u201d\nHollande said he stood firmly by French military intervention in Iraq and Syria in 2014 and 2015, saying: \u201cThe biggest victims of Islamist terrorism are Muslims.\u201d\nHe described being within earshot of the first explosion, when a suicide bomber blew himself up outside the gates of the national stadium.\nHollande said: \u201cWhen the first explosion sounded, and a player stopped, surprised, I realised that it could be an attack. When the second explosion went off, I no longer had any doubts.\u201d\nHe said he had left his seat to consult with security officials and decided the match should continue and \u201ceverything should be done to avoid panic\u201d. He told a German government minister and the head of the French parliament, who were present, to stay in their seats. He went to the interior ministry to coordinate the response.\nLater that night he decided to go to the Bataclan himself, watching bloodied survivors walk out after an ordeal that had lasted two hours. \u201cI saw people leaving the Bataclan, even then, holding on to each other. They saw me and could not say a single word,\u201d he testified. \u201cThat will remain with me for ever.\u201d",

He held bold positions that veered radically left of the usual law-and-order script: he vowed to stop prosecuting minor quality of life crimes, create a unit to look at past wrongful convictions and eliminate cash bail. One of his most contested campaign goals was to stop the use of gang enhancements, which can add up to 10 years to someone\u2019s sentence and is disproportionately used on Black and Latino people.\nBoudin supporters say those progressive policies of ending mass incarceration and promoting restorative justice are what San Francisco wants, that he\u2019s been blamed unfairly for problems that have vexed the city for years and has been thwarted by a pandemic-related slowdown in the courts.\nCritics charge he has failed to prosecute repeat offenders, allowing them to commit more crimes that have contributed to the deterioration of the city\u2019s quality of life. They have pointed at videos of brazen shoplifting and auto break-ins during the pandemic, reinforcing the idea of the city as a lawless place.\nThe recall effort was widely expected to make the ballot after backers submitted about 80,000 signatures in October, more than the 51,325 required. The 7 June election will be consolidated with the California statewide primary election.\n\u201cWe have tremendous momentum on our side that is growing daily in every corner of San Francisco,\u201d said the recall campaign chair, Mary Jung, in a statement. She promised to \u201chelp ensure San Francisco has a DA that makes public safety their number one priority\u201d.\nJulie Edwards, a spokesperson for the anti-recall campaign, said in a statement: \u201cThe recall is an attempt to reverse the reforms DA Boudin has enacted to keep us safe and make the criminal justice system fairer. But this will not stop him from continuing to work for all San Franciscans.\u201d\nBoudin\u2019s recall election is the latest effort to oust officials part of the electorate argues have failed.\nEarlier this year, California\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, defeated a recall effort organized by critics of his pandemic and criminal justice policies.\nSan Francisco voters will also get the chance to recall three members of the city\u2019s board of education. The board drew national attention last year when it moved ahead with a plan to rename nearly four dozen schools as part of a racial reckoning while classrooms stayed shuttered, even as other districts opened to in-class instruction. The renaming plan was scrapped.\nMayor London Breed, a Democrat who did not support Boudin in the DA\u2019s race, has not expressed an opinion on his recall. She would name his replacement should the recall succeed.\nBreed, however, said on Tuesday in a statement that she supports the recall of all three school board members, saying the board\u2019s priorities were misplaced. She would also get to name their replacements should they lose.",

Sinner, one of the best young players on the tour, has won two indoor titles in recent weeks.\n\u201cI\u2019m convinced I can play \u2026 well, I can. I\u2019m playing at the top level and I\u2019m winning matches against the best players in the world,\u201d said Murray when discussing the doubts he had about his tennis earlier in the year. \u201cThe ones that I\u2019m losing, I\u2019m pushing the best players in the world. That argument is finished. I can compete at the top level.\u201d\nThe rise of Sinner has been defined by his clean, destructive shotmaking but Murray matched his intensity and frustrated the Italian with his fast-improving movement. While Murray did initially struggle with his return, in the tie-break he finally imposed himself on Sinner\u2019s serve and he thrived on the big points. At 4-4 he slipped in a second serve ace, to which Sinner responded with a double fault. Murray soon took the set.\nThe most notable aspect of Murray\u2019s performance was how he maintained a consistent level and intensity throughout, controlling the match with an array of drop shots, low slices and smart angles while patiently waiting for the right moments to attack his forehand. Sinner\u2019s level, by contrast, dipped at the beginning of the second set and Murray refused to allow him back into the match as he secured an excellent win.\nAfterwards, Murray said that he felt he had strayed from his normal patient, varied game style earlier in the year amid the many comments from pundits and former pros suggesting that he needed to play more attacking tennis and take more risks in order to be successful again. Now he is playing with far more clarity and his confidence is clear. \u201cI said in the last few weeks, it\u2019s coming,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s coming. I don\u2019t know if it will be this week or the beginning of next year, but I\u2019m going to be pushing and getting deep in tournaments again.\u201d\nMurray will now seek to reach his first tour semi-final in two years when he faces Tommy Paul, a talented 52nd-ranked American, in the quarter-final. Dan Evans, the fourth seed in Stockholm, beat Alejandro Davidovich Fokina 7-6 (5), 6-2 and he will face Frances Tiafoe next.",

        "content": "After canceling his trip for \u2018family obligations\u2019, Gavin Newsom said he chose to take his children trick-or-treating\nCalifornia\u2019s governor made his first public appearance in nearly two weeks on Tuesday, after days of mounting speculation about his decision to abruptly cancel a trip to Cop26 and largely recede from public view.\nGavin Newsom said he chose to take his children trick-or-treating on Halloween rather than travel to Scotland to discuss the climate crisis with world leaders, explaining his decision was driven by the simple desire of a working parent to spend more time with his kids.\nNewsom\u2019s comments, delivered Tuesday at an economic summit in Monterey, came after increasing media coverage and criticism from Republicans about his whereabouts and what he was doing. His last public event had been on 27 October when he got a coronavirus booster shot. Two days later his office issued a brief statement saying he was canceling his travel plans for unspecified \u201cfamily obligations\u201d.\nHis staff would not answer questions about where he was or what he was doing for much of that time, sparking criticism from conservatives who spread rumors that Newsom was experiencing difficult side effects after his booster shot and rallied on social media around the hashtag #wheresgavin.\nPhotos over the weekend published in Vogue showed Newsom attending the lavish wedding of Ivy Love Getty, the granddaughter of the late billionaire oil tycoon J Paul Getty, whose family members have been large donors to Newsom\u2019s campaigns.\nJennifer Siebel Newsom, Newsom\u2019s wife, added to the intrigue on Sunday night with a since-deleted tweet telling people to \u201cplease stop hating and get a life\u201d.\nBut Tuesday, Newsom said his absence was nothing more than a chance to recharge with his family after a frenetic three years in office that included an unprecedented pandemic, record-breaking destruction from wildfires, a drought and fighting for his political life in only the second gubernatorial recall election in state history. Newsom beat back the recall in September and then spent the next several weeks considering hundreds of bills passed by the legislature.\nNewsom, who routinely has multiple public appearances each week, relishes his role as leader of the nation\u2019s most populous state, which if it were its own country would have the world\u2019s fifth-largest economy, making his absence after the sudden withdrawal from the climate conference so unusual.\nAnd the climate crisis is a signature issue for the governor, who many believe has aspirations of running for president some day. Attending the conference would have given him the opportunity to tout his climate change initiatives, which include banning sales of new gas-powered cars and trucks by 2035, and would raise his profile with world leaders. But as the trip neared, his children took the initiative, he said.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been on this damn treadmill, we\u2019ve gone from crisis to crisis,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cThe kids, literally, they kind of had an intervention. They said they couldn\u2019t believe that I was going to miss Halloween.\u201d\nNewsom said for his kids, who range in age from 5 to 12, missing Halloween is worse than missing Christmas. \u201cI had no damn choice; I had to cancel that trip,\u201d he said. Newsom\u2019s comments earned applause from the audience and praise from his fellow Democrats in the state legislature, many of whom blamed the governor\u2019s political opponents and the media for blowing the story out of proportion.\nAssemblyman Ash Kalra tweeted that had Newsom attended the conference, he would have been criticized \u201cfor traveling overseas instead of staying home attending to the state\u201d.\n\u201cHe just can\u2019t win,\u201d Kalra said.\nWesley Hussey, a political science professor at Sacramento State University, said Newsom could have prevented much of the fuss if he had simply said at the outset why he wasn\u2019t attending the conference and taking a step back from public appearances.\n\u201cI think this is an example of where the governor and his press operations need to be aware of social media and distortions and always being in front of the story,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we should know what the governor is up to and give the governor space when he needs family time. And I think that those can go together.\u201d\nNeither the governor nor his representatives said why they didn\u2019t offer details about Newsom\u2019s whereabouts before this week. On Monday, Newsom\u2019s office said the governor had been working in the Capitol on \u201curgent issues, including Covid-19 vaccines for kids, boosters, ports, the forthcoming state budget and California\u2019s continued economic recovery\u201d.\nWhen he emerged Tuesday, Newsom added details of his week out of the spotlight. He went to his childrens\u2019 soccer tournament and took them trick-or-treating, having quickly found a pirate costume to join them. He said he brought his children to the Capitol last week, participating for the first time in tourist traditions like taking a selfie with the statue of a grizzly bear \u2013 the animal that appears on the state flag \u2013 outside the governor\u2019s office.\nThe children also got coloring books that are regular handouts from the senate president pro tempore\u2019s office.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been probably the most productive week I\u2019ve had since I\u2019ve been governor,\u201d Newsom said.",

In BorisWorld, all Boris Johnson has to do is turn up to sprinkle the stardust of mindless optimism and things fall into place. It worked for Brexit and it worked for his 2019 general election campaign. Bertie Booster ruled OK. But climate change is a rather tougher nut to crack. Other countries aren\u2019t quite so susceptible to his charms and the Cop26 summit in Glasgow is in danger of ending in disappointment.\nQuite what Johnson expected to achieve by turning up to Cop26 for a few hours on Wednesday afternoon was anyone\u2019s guess. Still, at least he travelled by train this time. Maybe he just couldn\u2019t accept his powerlessness and that his presence was a total waste of time. That talk of banging negotiators\u2019 heads together really wouldn\u2019t cut it after all. Whatever it was, there was none of the Bertie Booster tub-thumping about the 25-minute press conference he gave shortly before he scuttled back to London.\nThis was about as close as you\u2019ll ever get to Johnson admitting defeat. He did go through the motions of saying \u201c1.5 was still alive\u201d but his body language rather suggested the opposite. His shoulders were stooped and his opening speech was delivered with little enthusiasm.\nWe were into the hard yards, he said. Stuck in a rolling maul in the final furlong. Our children and grandchildren would not forgive us if we didn\u2019t agree a deal. And right now he would settle for one that he could sell as significant even if it was effectively worthless. Just to save face. What was required was more ambition and implementation. It wasn\u2019t clear who he expected to supply them. \u201cWhen are leaders going to lead?\u201d he asked. It\u2019s a question some of us have been asking about him for a while now.\nThere were a few token questions about the conference but most of the media seemed to have already made up their minds that Cop26 wasn\u2019t going to be the gamechanger the government had tried to build it up to be before it started. Rather, they used the time to encourage the prime minister to break his omert\u00e0 on Tory sleaze. For the last week or so, Bertie Booster has been uncharacteristically quiet.\nIt soon became clear why. Because Johnson was about to rewrite history to suit himself. Even for such an accomplished liar, this was quite something. A deception on the grandest of scales. A self-deception on the most tawdry of scales. Here was Johnson, a man incapable of honesty and bereft of self-esteem, pulling out all the stops to distance himself from the scene of the crime. This is his special talent. Because he doesn\u2019t just always betray his family, friends and colleagues. He also always betrays himself. The self-loathing must be intense.\nBoris began by saying that any MP who had been found to have broken the rules must be punished. Er \u2026 yes. Only he appeared to have totally forgotten that Owen Paterson had been found guilty of multiple egregious cases of paid advocacy. And that Johnson had imposed a three-line whip on his own MPs to get his suspension put on hold until the case had been re-examined by a new committee with a majority of well-disposed Tory members, who would now come to the right conclusion. It was about as sleazy as it gets.\nYet here was a Bertie Booster, admittedly on worn-out Duracell batteries, trying to portray himself as a champion of natural justice. Boris Johnson is going to be very angry when he catches up with Boris Johnson who fucked up so badly. He could scarcely bring himself to mention Geoffrey Cox. There again, he must be sick with envy at the amount Geoff has raked in since becoming an MP.\nFrom there on in, it was something of a pile-on. Johnson was entirely unrepentant. Three times he was asked to apologise, and three times he said nothing. Not even an insincere expression of regret for impressions that might have been given. The Tory MPs whose second jobs have come under the microscope as a direct result of his own misjudgment might at least be hoping for a \u201csorry\u201d in private. Despite all evidence to the contrary, he also declared that the UK was about as uncorrupt a country as you could find \u2013 \u00a33m for a peerage, anyone? There again, he is a prime minister who once declared the \u00a3250k a year for his Telegraph column to be \u201cchicken feed\u201d, so no wonder he can\u2019t see what all the fuss is about.\nStill, Boris wasn\u2019t finished. He then said there was nothing wrong with second jobs provided MPs put their constituents first. Something he had failed to do when he had carried on as London mayor despite being elected to Westminster in 2015. And he insisted his own behaviour was beyond reproach. It was just nobody\u2019s business who paid for the redecoration of his Downing Street flat. Or if he accepted a free holiday from someone he put in the House of Lords. Wrongdoing must be punished, he said repeatedly. Perhaps he has a subconscious desire to be found out. One for his therapist.\nNone of this would have gone down well with Tories hoping to draw a line under the corruption scandal. Far from killing the story, Johnson had taken politics a step further into the sleaze bath by refusing to accept any responsibility. Par for the course for a self-destructive narcissist. He was asked why he didn\u2019t stay up in Glasgow, even if the chances of a meaningful deal were minute. Just to show he cared. But then he doesn\u2019t really. The only thing he really cares about is himself.\nA Farewell to Calm by John Crace (Guardian Faber, \u00a39.99). To support the Guardian and Observer, order your copy at guardianbookshop.com.

He also referred to Taiwan as China\u2019s \u201cfront doorstep\u201d.\nIn response, a spokesperson for Taiwan\u2019s ministry of foreign affairs told Guardian Australia that Taiwan and Australia were important partners, sharing universal values and common strategic interests and that China\u2019s aggression had far-reaching implications.\n\u201cThe crisis in the Taiwan Strait is by no means a domestic matter between Chinese, and the security of the Taiwan Strait involves the stability and prosperity of the Indo-Pacific region, but also the global peace, stability and development,\u201d Joanne Ou said.\nOu said the Australian government had demonstrated the importance it attached to the issue in regional dialogues and other multilateral partnerships.\n\u201cA peaceful and stable Indo-Pacific region is in the interest of Australia, Taiwan and other countries.\u201d\nThere is growing international concern about Beijing\u2019s military capability and potential plans for Taiwan, which it claims as a province of China that must be retaken. Under the rule of the Chinese Communist party leader Xi Jinping, Beijing rejects criticism as interference in its \u201cinternal affairs\u201d.\nIt has increased acts of aggression and rhetoric towards Taiwan, including near-daily sorties of warplanes into Taiwan\u2019s air defence identification zone, peaking with 149 over four days last month.\nThe US, which has strong ties to Taiwan and commitments to help it defend itself, has increased its military presence in the region, which has added to tensions.\nIn his appearance, Keating rejected the labelling of the Chinese flights as \u201cincursions\u201d and said: \u201cThe only time the Chinese will attack or be involved in Taiwan is if the Americans and the Taiwanese try and declare a change in the status of Taiwan.\u201d\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nTaiwan\u2019s government has repeatedly said it seeks to maintain the status quo, and has no intention to be \u201cadventurous\u201d. President Tsai Ing-wen says the island is already a sovereign nation with no need to declare independence.\n\u201cThe Chinese government has never stopped its military threats and diplomatic crackdowns on Taiwan, and has continued to engage in [disinformation] operations against Taiwan and to invade Taiwan\u2019s air defense identification zone (ADIZ),\u201d Ou said.\n\u201cIn addition to trying to reduce Taiwan\u2019s space for international affairs, China has also continued to intrude on its neighbours \u2026 in the East and South China Seas.\n\u201cThe Taiwanese government and people are defending not only the way of life of Taiwan\u2019s 23.5 million people, but also the values of democratic freedom that global democracies jointly defend.\u201d\nKeating said the \u201cgeneral point\u201d of Xi and previous leaders was that they would \u201charmoniously lead the Chinese people into coming to terms with one another\u201d. But successive polling shows a growing majority of Taiwanese people do not wish to be ruled by China and, while Xi has stated he hopes \u201creunification\u201d will occur peacefully, he has not ruled out annexing Taiwan by force.\nKeating also incorrectly stated that Australia has \u201calways seen [Taiwan] as a part of China\u201d.\n\u201cThe whole world has regarded China and Taiwan as one country, the Taiwanese have regarded it as one country, the Chinese, one country,\u201d he said.\nFourteen countries recognise Taiwan as a sovereign nation, while more than 70 others have informal diplomatic ties. Beijing claims Taiwan as a province under its one-China principle but the principle is not universally recognised, including by Australia.\nAustralia\u2019s one-China policy, like the US\u2019s, only acknowledges Beijing\u2019s claim and does not recognise or reject it.\nA Lowy Institute senior fellow, Richard McGregor, told the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age that Keating\u2019s narrative about Taiwan had been out of date \u201cfor decades\u201d.\n\u201cOur military interest is not in fighting a war over Taiwan but in helping ensure we don\u2019t have to,\u201d he said.\nWen-ti Sung, a lecturer on China-Taiwan-US relations at the Australian National University, said Taiwan was important to Australia \u201cfor ideological affinity and for ensuring the credibility of the US\u2019s values-based coalition-building, without which US withdrawal from the Indo-Pacific, and weakened Australia-US relationship, will become more likely\u201d.\n\u201cGood people can disagree on whether that makes Taiwan per se a vital strategic interest to Australia, but a strong and dependable US regional engagement certainly is a vital interest for Australia. And Taiwan is an important part of that puzzle.\u201d",

        "content": "Sam Underhill says England are dealing with Covid disruption before their match against Australia on Saturday by facing the problem head-on. Their captain, Owen Farrell, sat out England\u2019s opening autumn international victory over Tonga but produced a false-positive test result and has returned to training.\nHowever, on Tuesday the prop Joe Marler was ruled out of facing the Wallabies after contracting the virus, with the 21-year-old uncapped Sale prop Bevan Rodd called up by Eddie Jones as replacement for Marler on the bench, providing loosehead cover for Ellis Genge.\nUnderhill believes England have become used to such 11th-hour changes and have the correct protocols in place \u2013 and a clean bill of health was reported on Wednesday \u201cIt\u2019s part of the game now,\u201d says the Bath flanker. \u201cIt\u2019s part of life, as a squad we\u2019ve got to be adaptable. Joe is a big character and we\u2019ll miss him and I hope he\u2019s all right.\n\u201cIt\u2019s better to address it than to try and ignore it and pretend it\u2019s not there. That way we can deal with it. We had a good training session this morning after a little bit of disruption, so we\u2019ve shown we can handle it.\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of those things, you try to control what you can control but we can\u2019t control this. The lads are being careful and there\u2019s a good level of protocol around the place to make sure we\u2019re not losing players unnecessarily.\u201d\nUnderhill, who picked up a knock before the break against Tonga and was replaced by Alex Dombrandt in England\u2019s 69-3 romp, said there have been changes after the two Covid setbacks. \u201cWhenever there is a positive or a threat everything does get a bit tighter and we\u2019ve also got a job to do training-wise.\u201d\nHaving Farrell back in training has been a boon, his presence bringing a welcome zest to the buildup to Wallabies, who England last faced in the bruising World Cup quarter-final win in October 2019. \u201cHe\u2019s a brilliant guy to have around,\u201d says Underhill. \u201cHe\u2019s very influential, he\u2019s a very motivational character, he works hard, drives people around him and he brings a good sense of calm.\n\u201cCourtney [Lawes] was excellent in stepping into that role last week, again a very chilled guy but he instils everyone with a lot of confidence.\u201d\nEngland\u2019s attentions now turn to the challenging prospect of meeting a side smarting from their 15-13 defeat by Scotland at Murrayfield last Sunday but still ranked No 3 in the world. That England have beaten them seven times on the trot is not influencing Underhill\u2019s preparations for a significant step up from Tonga.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think form matters too much, it\u2019s a bit of a hot-hand fallacy, you\u2019ve got to turn up on the day,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat someone has done in a previous game doesn\u2019t matter too much \u2013 you\u2019re only as good as your next game.\u201d\nRegardless, any collision with Australia comes with an extra frisson and a fair dollop of mutual respect. \u201cThere\u2019s a massive bit of competition there,\u201d says Underhill. \u201cIt brings an emotional edge to the game, which in a contact sport is always a useful thing to have.\u201d\nRecollections of the 2019 World Cup quarter-final victory on Kyushu Island have dimmed somewhat but there are certain aspects of the Wallabies\u2019 style that remain a constant. \u201cIt is a bit of a blur,\u201d says Underhill. \u201cI remember it being fast and there being a lot of ground to cover. They are a good attacking team and they have got some brilliant individuals who are very good at beating defenders.\nCardiff flanker Ellis Jenkins will captain Wales in Sunday's Autumn Nations Series clash against Fiji.\nJenkins delivered an outstanding performance on his return to Test rugby after a three-year injury absence when Wales were beaten narrowly by world champions South Africa last weekend.\nWales head coach Wayne Pivac has handed starts to Ospreys wing Alex Cuthbert \u2013 his first Wales appearance for four years \u2013 flanker Thomas Young and scrum-half Kieran Hardy, while Josh Adams moves from wing to centre, where he is partnered in midfield by Johnny Williams.\nAnd there is a place on the bench for uncapped 19-year-old Exeter forward Christ Tshiunza, where he is joined by players such as Bristol fly-half Callum Sheedy and Ospreys prop Gareth Thomas.\nTshiunza, a second-row or back-row player, was born in DR Congo but moved to Wales in 2010 and is a product of Whitchurch High School in Cardiff, whose past pupils also include Sam Warburton, Gareth Bale and Geraint Thomas.\nWasps flanker Young's call-up is the only change to the pack, although flanker Taine Basham switches to No 8 instead of an injured Aaron Wainwright.\nBehind the scrum, Liam Williams makes a first start of the autumn campaign, lining up at full-back, with Dan Biggar again wearing the No 10 shirt. Cuthbert, meanwhile, wins his 49th cap, having last featured for Wales against Georgia in November 2017.\nOn Tshiunza's selection, Pivac said: \"He has come in and he has trained well. We are looking at him as a player, in the future, who can hopefully cover two positions, in the second-row and at six.\n\"We are really looking forward to seeing him out there. He will be full of energy, he is very excited about the opportunity and he is one for the future.\" PA Media\nTeam: L Williams (Scarlets); A Cuthbert (Ospreys), J Adams (Cardiff), J Williams (Scarlets), L Rees-Zammit (Gloucester); D Biggar (Northampton), K Hardy (Scarlets); R Carre (Cardiff), R Elias (Scarlets), T Francis (Ospreys), W Rowlands (Dragons), A Beard (Ospreys), E Jenkins (Cardiff, capt), T Young (Wasps), T Basham (Dragons).\nReplacements: B Roberts (Ulster), G Thomas (Ospreys), W John (Scarlets), C Tshiunza (Exeter), S Davies (Cardiff), T Williams (Cardiff), C Sheedy (Bristol), N Tompkins (Saracens).\n\u201cIn attack they are a very physical team and they hit the breakdown hard, that is what I remember from that, and they had Pocock and Hooper playing, brilliant 7s, brilliant back-rowers, both of them at every breakdown.\u201d\nThe prospect of going toe-to-toe with Michael Hooper is certainly stirring Underhill, given the flanker has long been a source of inspiration. \u201cHe is one of the guys, as a young player, I would look up to,\u201d says Underhill, an England regular under Jones since the 2017 summer tour of Argentina. \u201cHe has been outstanding for a long time so it is great to play able to play against a guy like that.\u201d\nAfter Saturday\u2019s meeting with Australia, England\u2019s final autumn international will be against the world champions, South Africa, at Twickenham on 20 November.",

This all-encompassing set looks like the industrious spinning of one of Louise Bourgeois\u2019s giant spiders. But its sense of spectacle does not pay off in a production whose theatricality overwhelms its stories.\nDirected and designed by Melly Still, Colin Teevan\u2019s play, first performed as a staged reading in 2006, is \u201cthe result of a long conversation between Euripides and me\u201d in which he resuscitates the unhappy mothers and lost children of ancient Greek tragedy. A seven-part monologue cycle set in the modern day, it features the notorious \u2013 and notoriously wronged \u2013 women of Euripidean tragedy: Medea, Phaedra, Hypsipyle, Persephone, Demeter, Alcestis and Creusa. Their stories include rape, kidnap and murder, and centre on maternal pain and loss. But the pathos and intensity in Teevan\u2019s script is lost on the stage, rendered overly stylised and emotionally absent.\nNiamh Cusack and Shannon Hayes, who share all the roles, are tasked not only with moving between monologues, one often acting out what the other is narrating and chipping in with dialogue, but also manoeuvring the set as well as traversing a stage that has two upper circles and two plank-like walkways above it.\nThe actors create a commotion that feels unnecessary and distracts us from their characters\u2019 inner worlds. Cusack and Hayes are so busy manipulating the set, winding string or running in circles that this seems to inhibit them from going deeper into their roles. The performances appear flighty and frantic, as if the actors are running in and out of those, too.\nHayes\u2019s Medea is not a filicidal murderer here but an abused wife, with Cusack, as her abusive partner, acting out his violence on cushions and on a chalk silhouette on the floor. Cusack\u2019s Phaedra is a drunk who tries to batten down her desire for her stepson with alcohol; Hayes plays him wordlessly, flicking through a year 12 course book and pointing out the empty wine bottles unsubtly. Hypsipyle is a teenage childminder gabbling to her friend on the phone and fed up with looking after a rich woman\u2019s baby, whose cries are played out by Cusack rather gratingly as she walks around the stage.\nIn the story of Alcestis (a wife donating an organ at her peril to a husband whose wrecked liver is a result of too much partying) Cusack impersonates Pierce Brosnan and the whimsy of the piece just does not work.\nThe comedy feels an awkward fit and the drama quavers between archness and earnestness. Potent moments peep through and point at lost promise, where less could have been more.\nThe Seven Pomegranate Seeds is at the Rose theatre, Kingston upon Thames, until 20 November.",

It is thought the outbreak in west Africa in 2014-16 may have led to more than 11,000 deaths, while the outbreak in the DRC between August 2018 and June 2020 claimed more than 2,200 lives.\nHighly effective vaccines against Ebola have been developed in recent years but experts warn these have only been approved for one of the four species of the Ebola virus. This is the Zaire species that is responsible for many outbreaks, and has the highest mortality rate, with estimates of between 70% and 90%.\n\u201cThere are three other important species of Ebola virus out there that these vaccines aren\u2019t approved to prevent,\u201d said Dr Daniel Jenkin, principal investigator of the trial at the Jenner Institute, University of Oxford.\nOf these other species, the Sudan Ebola virus is thought to have a mortality rate of about 50%, with Jenkin noting it has caused the second largest number of outbreaks.\nNow researchers at the University of Oxford say they are due to start human trials of a new Ebola vaccine that has been designed to protect against both the Zaire and Sudan species of the Ebola virus.\n\u201cThe two species that we\u2019re targeting in this vaccine have caused almost all of the outbreaks and deaths,\u201d said Jenkin.\nAs with the Oxford/AstraZeneca Covid jab, the Ebola vaccine is based on a virus that causes the common cold in chimpanzees, but which has been modified so it cannot cause illness in humans. However, instead of inserting spike protein genes from the coronavirus into the genetic material of this chimp virus \u2013 as was the case for the Covid vaccine \u2013 the team have loaded the chimp virus with genes for the main protein on the surface of the Ebola virus.\n\u201cBasically, we have two copies of that \u2013 one copy from the Zaire Ebola virus species and one copy from the Sudan Ebola virus species,\u201d said Jenkin.\nWhile there are other vaccines in development to protect against more than one species of the Ebola virus, Jenkin said the new jab was the first to use the same underlying technology as employed for the Oxford/AstraZeneca Covid vaccine. That, he added, could bring practical benefits.\n\u201c[The Covid jab] is now being manufactured at 20 different manufacturing sites, including in middle income countries,\u201d he said. \u201cHaving that proof of concept that a similar vaccine can be manufactured on an incredibly large scale is also a very big advantage.\u201d\nWhile the first jab of the new Ebola vaccine is being given on Thursday, the team say they are looking for 26 healthy volunteers, aged between 18 and 55, for the phase 1 clinical trial. Those interested in signing up can do so online.\nParticipants will be given one dose of the jab and then followed up over a six-month period to allow researchers to explore the safety of the vaccine and the immune response it triggers.\nDavid Matthews, professor of virology at the University of Bristol, who was not involved in the development of the new Ebola jab, but was involved in studying mechanisms by which the Oxford/AstraZeneca Covid vaccine works, said using the same technology made sense.\n\u201cYou have a huge safety profile database and you have [a] well-understood manufacturing process,\u201d he said.",

Corrosive river water caused lead to leach from pipes, contaminating the drinking water and causing an outbreak of Legionnaires\u2019 disease.\nThe Flint water crisis was one of the country\u2019s worst public health crises in recent memory. The case became emblematic of racial inequality in the United States as it afflicted a city of about 100,000 people, more than half of whom are African-Americans.\nThe contamination prompted several lawsuits from parents who said their children were showing dangerously high blood levels of lead, which can cause development disorders. Lead can be toxic and children are especially vulnerable.\nThe former Michigan governor Rick Snyder was charged in January with two counts of willful neglect of duty over the lead-poisoning of Flint\u2019s drinking water.\nPayouts from the settlement approved on Wednesday will be made based on a formula that directs more money to younger claimants and to those who can prove greater injury. Michigan\u2019s attorney general has previously said that the settlement would rank as the largest in the state\u2019s history.\n\u201cAlthough this is a significant victory for Flint, we have a ways to go in stopping Americans from being systematically poisoned in their own homes, schools, and places of work,\u201d said Corey Stern, a counsel for the plaintiffs, in a statement after the judge\u2019s order on Wednesday.\nThe judge said it was \u201cremarkable\u201d that more than half of Flint\u2019s 81,000 residents have signed up for a share of the settlement. It\u2019s not clear just how much each child will receive.\nFlint resident Melissa Mays, a 43-year-old social worker, said her three sons have had medical problems and learning challenges due to lead.\n\u201cHopefully it\u2019ll be enough to help kids with tutors and getting the medical care they need to help them recover from this,\u201d Mays said. \u201cA lot of this isn\u2019t covered by insurance. These additional needs, they cost money.\u201d\nShe considers the settlement a win.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made history,\u201d Mays said, \u201cand hopefully it sets a precedent to maybe don\u2019t poison people. It costs more in the long run.\u201d",

        "content": "Its gurus increasingly promote vaccine scepticism, conspiracy theories and the myth that ill people have themselves to blame. How did self-care turn so nasty?\nOzlem Demirboga Carr is not really into all that woo\u2011woo stuff. \u201cI\u2019m definitely a full-science kind of person,\u201d says the 41-year-old telecoms worker from Reading. She doesn\u2019t believe in crystals, affirmations or salt lamps. But she did find herself unusually anxious during the UK\u2019s Covid lockdown in March 2020 and, like many people, decided to practise yoga as a way to de-stress.\n\u201cI tried to be open-minded and I was open to advice on trying to improve my wellbeing and mental health,\u201d she says. So she followed a range of social media accounts, including the \u201csomatic therapist and biz coach\u201d Phoebe Greenacre, known for her yoga videos, and the \u201cwomen\u2019s empowerment and spiritual mentor\u201d Kelly Vittengl. The Instagram algorithm did its work. \u201cI suddenly found myself following so many wellness accounts,\u201d she says.\nWhen the deployment of the Covid vaccine got under way, Carr began to see posts that troubled her, ranging from polite concern about the social consequences of mass vaccination, or the politics underpinning it, to full-blown rejection of the science. \u201cThe conversation and tone of their posts shifted,\u201d she says. \u201cAt first it was all about self-care and being part of a community that is caring for each other. But then they started to speak more about how there should be a choice when it came to vaccines. They were saying things like: \u2018My body, my choice.\u2019\u201d\nCarr watched as Greenacre posted an Instagram story describing vaccine passports as \u201cmedical apartheid\u201d. Vittengl went further. In a post in July, Vittengl, who is unvaccinated, compared vaccine passports to the social polarisation witnessed during the Holocaust and spoke about the \u201cmess\u201d caused by the \u201cideology of the western medical system\u201d. \u201cWe aren\u2019t being shown the full picture,\u201d Vittengl concluded, in a post that was liked by Greenacre. Greenacre subsequently invited Vittengl on to her podcast, where Vittengl discussed the pernicious influence of \u201cbig pharma\u201d and celebrated the work of the controversial doctor Zach Bush, who has been called a \u201cCovid denialist\u201d by researchers at McGill University in Montreal.\nSuch views are anything but exceptional in the wellness community. If anything, they are on the milder end of the spectrum. Anti-vaccine or vaccine-hesitant attitudes are as abundant in online wellness circles as pastel-coloured Instagram infographics and asana poses on the beach at sunset. \u201cPeople are really confused by what is happening,\u201d says Derek Beres, the co-host of Conspirituality, a podcast about the convergence of conspiracy theories and wellness. \u201cWhy is their yoga instructor sharing QAnon hashtags?\u201d\nIn May, the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) found that just 12 influencers were responsible for nearly 65% of anti-vaccine content on Facebook and Twitter. \u201cMany of these leading anti-vaxxers are alternative health entrepreneurs \u2026 They\u2019re reaching millions of users every day,\u201d says Callum Hood of the CCDH. \u201cThis is a serious problem. Vaccine hesitancy has become a difficult and entrenched obstacle to dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic.\u201d\nIncluded within the CCDH\u2019s \u201cdisinformation dozen\u201d are Joseph Mercola, a US wellness entrepreneur called the \u201cmost influential spreader of Covid-19 misinformation online\u201d by the New York Times; Dr Christiane Northrup, a wellness expert who helped popularise the notorious Covid pseudo-documentary Plandemic by sharing it with her 560,000 Facebook followers; and Kelly Brogan, a contributor to Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s Goop wellness platform. Mikki Willis, the director of Plandemic, is well known in the California yoga scene, while David \u201cAvocado\u201d Wolfe, a conspiracy theorist and raw food advocate, is a regular figure at anti-vaccination protests across the US.\nAway from the CCDH\u2019s list, other prominent figures include the yoga instructor Stephanie Birch, who has posted QAnon hashtags on her now-deleted Instagram account, and Krystal Tini, a wellness influencer with 169,000 Instagram followers, who has consistently posted anti-vaccine content, including one post that compared lockdowns to the horrors inflicted on Polish Jews in the Warsaw ghetto. Comparing vaccine deployment to historic atrocities such as slavery and the Holocaust is a routine trope in anti-vaccine wellness circles; the Los Angeles wellness and beauty guru Shiva Rose recently compared vaccines to McCarthyism, slavery, the Cultural Revolution, the Spanish Inquisition and the Holocaust, all in one post.\nBeres says many of these wellness influencers are \u201cusing cult leader techniques in digital spaces\u201d, sowing fear and hesitancy about the Covid vaccine among their followers, one Instagram post at a time.\nThey maintain, however, that they are misunderstood or misrepresented. When contacted by the Guardian, Greenacre distanced herself from Vittengl\u2019s comments on her podcast. \u201cIt would be incorrect and misleading to your readers to suggest comments from a third party reflect my own,\u201d she said. She also said that she used the term \u201cmedical apartheid\u201d to refer to \u201cthe use of discrimination and segregation based on medical status, for example treating people negatively based on their medical status by use of Covid vaccine passports\u201d, rather than anything relating to historical discrimination based on race.\nVittengl, meanwhile, stated that she is \u201cnot against the western medical system \u2026 However, I do feel that the industry has been heavily taken over by big pharmaceutical companies who are primarily concerned with finances over health.\u201d She defended the work of Bush. \u201cHe is compassionately trying to help find more answers,\u201d she said.\nCarr, however, decided to unfollow both women. Now, when she wants to practise yoga, she watches the Sweaty Betty YouTube channel.\nWe have had more than a decade of the modern iteration of wellness. A decade of vagina candles, chia bowls, coffee enemas and spirulina shots. A decade of burnt-out, anxious, unhappy women seeking to detoxify their bodies, rebalance their chakras and recentre their divine femininity, ideally while losing weight. The global wellness industry is worth about $1.5tn (\u00a31.1tn) \u2013 and for every saintly Yoga With Adriene there are thousands of grifters pushing untested therapies on impressionable people.\nAlthough the modern iteration of wellness rose out of the primordial goop of the late 00s (Paltrow, the high priest of wellness, founded her lifestyle brand in 2008, originally as a newsletter), the origins of the movement go back to the hippy counterculture of the 70s. Then, as now, wellness presented itself as a remedy to the travails of modern life. It was structured around three tenets: robust individualism, distrust of western medicine and a commitment to self-optimisation, usually through restrictive diets and vigorous exercise regimens, designed to stave off disease and death for as long as possible. In her 2018 book Natural Causes: Life, Death and the Illusion of Control, Barbara Ehrenreich wrote: \u201cWellness is the means to remake oneself into an ever-more perfect self-correcting machine, capable of setting goals and moving toward them with smooth determination.\u201d\nIn the 70s and 80s, Ann Wigmore proselytised the ability of a raw-food diet to cure cancer, diabetes and Aids. \u201cThere is this belief that if you stay true to a certain lifestyle and only ingest a particular kind of food and drink, that guards you against disease,\u201d says Carl Cederstr\u00f6m, the co-author of Desperately Seeking Self-Improvement: A Year Inside the Optimization Movement. \u201cYou create a strong armour around yourself by living healthily.\u201d\nBy contrast, western medicine \u2013 in particular the pernicious influence of big pharma \u2013 conspires to keep the masses sick. \u201cThere\u2019s this suspicion about science,\u201d Cederstr\u00f6m says. \u201cYou often hear the rhetoric that modern civilisation is poisoning our lives, poisoning our food, and we need to find ways of living clean again, by cutting ourselves loose from a society that is constraining us and forcing us to live an inauthentic, unnatural lifestyle.\u201d\nThe polluting tributary in wellness\u2019s fresh, clear stream has always been its unwavering insistence that health is a choice rather than something genetically predetermined or socially ordained. Few wellness practitioners say outright that people who are morbidly obese, have type 2 diabetes or have a mental illness suffer by their own hand: they instead couch their judgment in euphemisms and misdirection.\n\u201cWellness has very strong ties to the self-help movement,\u201d says Cederstr\u00f6m. \u201cAnd what you find at the core of these movements is the idea that you should be able to help yourself.\u201d Rhonda Byrne, the author of the bestselling self-help book The Secret \u2013 which portrayed the power of positive thinking as a curative to all of life\u2019s ills \u2013 once claimed that the victims of 9/11 were in the wrong place at the wrong time due to their own negative thoughts and outlook on the world.\n\u201cA more general theory as to why people would happily tune into the ideology of wellness, and in particular this individualistic attitude, is that it is in some ways self-flattering,\u201d says Cederstr\u00f6m. \u201cWe live in a culture that connects morality to health. If you have a good, middle-class life, you\u2019re encouraged to believe that you deserve it. If you\u2019re poor and unhealthy \u2013 well, you didn\u2019t work hard enough.\u201d\nFor nearly 50 years, the world of wellness has viewed health as something that can be shrugged on or off at will, like a cashmere sweater. Doctors are to be distrusted and individuals should take responsibility for their own \u201cwellness journey\u201d. Then the Covid vaccine programme began \u2013 and this anti\u2011scientific attitude metastasised into something far more harmful. \u201cThis is a very long-running thing,\u201d says Hood. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing that erosion of trust in mainstream medicine flowering now. And it\u2019s very dangerous.\u201d\nBefore Catherine Gabitan, who is 31 and lives in northern California, became an \u201covercoming self-sabotage\u201d coach, she worked in the service industry. Gabitan usually rose to manager roles easily, but despite the promotions she never felt that she was fulfilling her true potential, as an A-grade student with a college degree.\nShe smoked cigarettes, drank coffee and alcohol and ate processed foods. Despite her best efforts, she could never kick these habits. \u201cOne of my initial inspirations for becoming really healthy was to make sure I had a really clean body, so that I could be the healthiest vessel I could be in order to have the healthiest baby,\u201d Gabitan says.\nIn early 2020, Gabitan bought a $199 lecture series from the self\u2011sabotage coach Jason Christoff. Christoff, who also styles himself as a nutrition and exercise expert, shares misinformation about the Covid vaccine on his public Facebook page and his Telegram channel.\nWhen contacted by the Guardian for comment, Christoff responded: \u201cMaybe you should look into who sponsors your own newspaper, but that would get you sacked.\u201d He subsequently wrote a blog linking the Guardian to a plot by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to reduce the global population by 10-15%. \u201cIs the Guardian and their sponsors watching out for public health or are they colluding to decrease population and public health, in order to place the remaining population under firm tyrannical control?\u201d Christoff wrote.\nChristoff helped Gabitan to realise that, for years, she had not believed herself to be worthy of \u201ca higher level of health\u201d. She explains: \u201cMy subconscious beliefs regarding why I didn\u2019t feel worthy of having a business or learning to invest, or why I drank alcohol or smoked cigarettes \u2013 all these things were related to what I felt worthy of achieving.\u201d\nChristoff\u2019s lecture series had the invigorating quality of an ice bath after a sauna. Almost immediately, Gabitan embarked upon what she calls her \u201chealth journey\u201d. She quit coffee, smoking, alcohol and gluten. She began exercising three times a week and eating only organic, locally produced food. She also quit the service industry, rebranding as a self-sabotage coach.\nWhen the Covid vaccine programme began, Gabitan, who is unvaccinated, began sharing anti-vaccine content on her Instagram page. \u201cInjecting poison will never make you healthy,\u201d she posted on 8 July. \u201cWe\u2019re taught that \u2018germs\u2019 and genetics make us sick so we don\u2019t have to take responsibility for our toxic lifestyles,\u201d she wrote on 23 July. \u201cCould other people\u2019s need to micromanage what we put on or in our bodies be a projection of their poor health history and inability to take responsibility for their own health?\u201d she asked on 16 August.\nGabitan sees health through a hyperindividualistic moral frame. She takes control of her own health; if other people won\u2019t help themselves, why should she? \u201cI don\u2019t smoke and I don\u2019t drink,\u201d she says. \u201cI spend a lot of money investing in the highest-quality foods available to me. I believe in natural immunity and supporting my immune system. I\u2019ve taken radical responsibility for that, especially over Covid. And there are other people out there who are still drinking alcohol and smoking cigarettes who want me to protect their health, but they won\u2019t even protect their own health.\u201d\nIn this, Gabitan exhibits the logical fallacy of wellness: the idea that the human mind is a drill sergeant and the organs of our body obediently fall in line. \u201cYou may exercise diligently, eat a medically fashionable diet, and still die of a sting from an irritated bee,\u201d Ehrenreich said in Natural Causes. \u201cYou may be a slim, toned paragon of wellness, and still a macrophage within your body may decide to throw in its lot with an incipient tumour.\u201d\nGabitan does not need the vaccine, because she is a shining paragon of health. The people dying from Covid are people with disabilities, or those who are already sick, obese or old. What happens to them is nothing for Gabitan to trouble herself about unduly, as an able-bodied member of the wellness community.\n\u201cA lot of the people that are experiencing hospitalisations from Covid had a lot of other co-morbidities, right?\u201d Gabitan says. \u201cOr they are overweight. If our government had promoted a healthy lifestyle, healthy eating, from the beginning \u2026 that would have done a lot more to prevent some of these hospitalisations by actually encouraging people to become the healthiest versions of themselves. Right. So, for me, one premise is people taking responsibility for their own health.\u201d\nIt sounds, I respond, as if you are saying that, when people get sick, it is their fault; not bad luck, because anyone can get sick at any time. \u201cSee, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s just bad luck,\u201d she says. \u201cI think part of it is people taking responsibility for their own health, to make sure they\u2019re not putting toxins in their body \u2013 and the other part of it is not being exposed to pollution.\u201d Nobody close to her has died from Covid.\nGabitan also believes the vaccine to be dangerous and ineffective. \u201cThe vaccine doesn\u2019t stop transmission,\u201d she says. (The vaccine is thought to reduce the risk of transmitting the virus to other people, although this protection wanes with time.) She is concerned about the impact of the vaccine on her fertility \u2013 this is a common fear among the vaccine-hesitant and is particularly prevalent in wellness circles, which are mostly female \u2013 and doesn\u2019t trust data released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the US health agency. She prefers to get information about the vaccine from Telegram, the Children\u2019s Health Defense (a group founded by Robert F Kennedy Jr that is a major source of vaccine disinformation) and Project Veritas, a far-right conspiracy theory site.\nAs a result of the research she has conducted over the last year, Gabitan\u2019s distrust of medical science now extends beyond the Covid vaccine. If she had children, she would not vaccinate them against any disease. She would reject modern medicine in virtually all cases, excepting broken bones. Modern medicine is \u201cdesigned to deal with symptoms, not the reason the symptoms showed up in the first place\u201d, she says.\nI ask Gabitan, who is affable and willing to answer all my questions, why she agreed to speak with me, given our dramatically different perspectives on the vaccine. \u201cTo have open dialogue, even with people with different opinions, is the only way that we can heal what\u2019s going on in the world,\u201d she says. I tell her that many people would find her attitude selfish and disturbing. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be callous,\u201d Gabitan says. \u201cBecause my goal is to help other people live the healthiest life that they can. That\u2019s my passion in the world.\u201d\nI am certain that she believes it.\nGabitan\u2019s views are by no means a reflection of all wellness practitioners. Deepak Chopra, the famed yoga and meditation expert, has urged people to get vaccinated. \u201cIt\u2019s mistaken and unfair to use a fringe group as the tar that stains everyone else,\u201d Chopra wrote in a blog in June. But Gabitan\u2019s attitude is an example, however extreme, of how the ideological structures of wellness may support anti-vaccine attitudes.\nBefore Conspirituality\u2019s Beres worked in technology, he was a yoga instructor. \u201cEven though I\u2019ve been involved in the yoga and wellness world since the 90s, I\u2019ve always been sceptical of a lot of the claims,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you get into yoga, there are a lot of health claims that sound OK if you\u2019re at a nice yoga studio in a major city, but don\u2019t reflect reality.\u201d\nHe sees people like Gabitan as the logical end point of 50 years of telling people that virtue is to be signalled with striated abs and a rippling musculature. \u201cWhen you live in a country where even a relatively modest middle-class lifestyle is way above what the rest of the world can sustain, it\u2019s very easy to get locked into anecdote and your circle of friends,\u201d Beres says. \u201cYou think: I drink smoothies and go to yoga and work out seven days a week and eat organic food. Why can\u2019t everyone else do it?\u201d\nThe US \u2013 the avocado stone of the global wellness community \u2013 is, and always has been, extremely individualistic. \u201cEverything is about personal freedom and personal knowledge. What we see here is late-stage capitalism merging with hyperindividualism,\u201d Beres says.\nThe US is also a country without universal healthcare. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have insurance, it\u2019s incredibly expensive to get treated,\u201d says Hood of the CCDH. \u201cPeople develop an interest in looking into alternatives and that\u2019s where wellness influencers step in. You don\u2019t have to spend thousands on doctors. You can just take this supplement or follow this regimen and you will be fine.\u201d\nFinally, it is a country where pharmaceutical companies have long behaved contemptibly. Last month, Purdue Pharma paid $4.5bn to settle its role in the opioid crisis, after overwhelming evidence emerged that the pharmaceutical company played down the addictive qualities of OxyContin for many years. Claims about the pernicious influence of big pharma are de rigueur in anti-vaccine circles; Plandemic\u2019s central thesis is that big pharma is suppressing affordable cures for Covid to make money from patented medicines.\n\u201cOne thing alternate health entrepreneurs have in common with anti-vaxxers is that they talk about big pharma a lot,\u201d says Hood. \u201cIt\u2019s no coincidence that the organised anti-vaxx movement has its home in the US. Because there\u2019s a greater profit motive in US healthcare, there\u2019s a level of suspicion.\u201d The irony, of course, is that many wellness practitioners are also motivated by profit. \u201cIt\u2019s a business for them, but they\u2019re not open about it,\u201d says Beres.\nBut to understand why some people may be driven to anti-vaccine attitudes is not to excuse their wider impact on community health, or the distressing implication that they regard the lives of those less fortunate than themselves as having scant value. \u201cSome of the most strikingly nasty stuff I\u2019ve seen with Covid misinformation has come from wellness influencers,\u201d Hood says.\nOn the subject of nastiness, he refers to a widely circulated meme (shared this year by the TV presenter Anthea Turner, to outrage) featuring a fat person on a mobility scooter asking a slim person to wear a mask. \u201cThe implication is that the person in the mobility scooter is somehow morally deficient and doesn\u2019t have the authority to ask someone to wear a mask,\u201d says Hood. There are similar attitudes where vaccines are concerned. \u201cThere is this nasty sense from some anti-vaxxer people that the people who have fallen ill with Covid are somehow deserving of it.\u201d\nSocial media companies, for their part, are reluctant to take down disinformation. \u201cSocial media is the wild west when it comes to health claims,\u201d says Hood. \u201cYou can say whatever you want.\u201d Research in 2020 by the CCDH found that platforms failed to act on 95% of Covid and vaccine misinformation reported to them.\nWellness influencers \u2013 including members of the CCDH\u2019s \u201cdisinformation dozen\u201d \u2013 remain on social media platforms with a nudge and a wink. Often, they refer users to their Telegram channels, where they really let rip. (Telegram is unmoderated.) While Northrup has had her Instagram account disabled, her Facebook page links to her Telegram channel, in which she deluges 58,000 people with a flow of anti-vaccine disinformation. Likewise, Wolfe exhorts his Facebook fans to follow him on Telegram, where he unleashes.\nTechnology companies are slow to take down anti-vaccine content, because it is lucrative. Mercola has 1.7m engaged followers on Facebook; Wolfe an astonishing 11.9m. Outrage fuels engagement, which drives revenue, for the influencer and the social media platform. In March, Mercola joined the newsletter platform Substack \u2013 his paid-for subscription costs $5 a month, of which Substack takes 10% as commission. It is already the 11th-most-read paid health newsletter on the platform. (While Substack\u2019s terms of use ban plagiarism, pornography and intellectual property theft, there is no prohibition on disinformation.)\nSome of the people pushing anti-vaccine content do so in the sincere belief they are working for the public good. \u201cThey believe themselves to be martyrs,\u201d Beres says. \u201cThey\u2019re fully bought in. They think this is an apocalyptic-level battle they were made for, to be the champions.\u201d But Beres believes others \u201care like: \u2018Wow. I can make a bunch of money here.\u2019\u201d\nWhen wellness influencers start to post anti-vaccine content online, a calcifying effect takes place. Pro-vaccine people unfollow; a few push back in the comments, but ultimately also unfollow, whereas followers who were hesitant about vaccines waver towards anti-vaccine attitudes and committed anti-vaxxers congregate, with applause. Before Gabitan began posting anti-vaccine content on her Instagram account, an average post would get 20-30 likes; now, she can easily get more than 150 likes on a post about big pharma. \u201cThe more people get this social reinforcement, the more anti-vaxx they become,\u201d says Hood.\nAs a result, anti-vaccine wellness influencers get an influx of followers, many of them new to the community. \u201cWhat happened after Plandemic is that QAnon infiltrated wellness circles,\u201d says Beres. \u201cYoga instructors started using QAnon hashtags and watched their following grow by hundreds of thousands.\u201d Online wellness is so closely affiliated with QAnon that the phenomenon has been called \u201cpastel QAnon\u201d by Marc-Andr\u00e9 Argentino, a researcher at Concordia University in Montreal. Carr is baffled by how QAnon, a rightwing movement, has infiltrated what was historically a hippy, countercultural space. \u201cThe similarities between rightwing groups and the wellness community scares me,\u201d she says.\nThis dopamine pull of likes and engagement encourages influencers to skew extreme, all the while positioning themselves as victims of so-called cancel culture or online hate mobs. In an Instagram story posted after Vittengl stated her views on vaccination, she portrayed herself as a victim. \u201cThe backlash is unbelievable,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAs an energetically sensitive person [someone who feels emotions in a heightened way] it can sometimes be too much. But \u2026 not speaking up no longer feels like a choice.\u201d She later tells me: \u201cI understand how this may come off as \u2018victim mentality\u2019, but it is a very real and very intense phenomenon.\u201d\nCarr finds this narrative maddening. \u201cThis community feels like they are being victimised, but they are not victims. They are privileged, well-off people with choices.\u201d Carr is British-Turkish and takes umbrage with how the community co-opts the language of human rights to advocate against vaccines. \u201cThat makes me crazy,\u201d says Carr. \u201cTo portray vaccines as against human rights ... I come from a country where human rights are constantly being diminished.\u201d\nIn the absence of action from the social media giants, all users like Carr can do is unfollow their former gurus. \u201cIn a passive way, that\u2019s my solution,\u201d she says. Many more users will no doubt replace them. \u201cIf you\u2019re an ordinary person who\u2019s having doubts about the vaccine and you start looking for answers, you\u2019re far more likely to come across an anti-vaxx source than you are an authoritative source like the NHS or CDC,\u201d says Hood. \u201cThese are effective and very intentional ways of radicalising people.\u201d\nHe hopes that this alignment of the wellness community with anti-vaxxers and conspiracy theorists will prompt a wider reappraisal of an industry that, for many years, has been replete with charlatans and quacks, profiting from that most fundamental of human desires \u2013 a desire for health. \u201cI\u2019m not saying the whole thing is rotten,\u201d Hood says. \u201cBut there are broader questions to be asked about wellness and the alternative health industry. This is the end product of telling people they can control their health through willpower and diet. Most of the time, as a society, we don\u2019t think that\u2019s so harmful. But when it comes to the pandemic, it\u2019s quite obvious that it is harmful. Probably the harms were there all the time. But the pandemic has exposed them.\u201d\n This article was amended on 11 November 2021. A previous version said CCDH research found that 95% of social media platforms failed to act on Covid and vaccine misinformation reported to them. In fact, the figure of 95% referred to the percentage of reported misinformation that was not removed by social media companies.",

        "content": "Slew of sleaze allegations engulfs Tories \u2026 China and the US in surprise deal to cut greenhouse gases \u2026 how the wellness sector turned nasty\nMorning everyone. This is Martin Farrer bringing you the day\u2019s top stories.\nSir Geoffrey Cox has earned at least \u00a36m from his second job since he entered parliament, a Guardian analysis reveals, and records show that he skipped 12 recent votes on days when he was doing paid legal work. The revelations came as Boris Johnson tried to reassure the public that the UK was \u201cnot remotely a corrupt country\u201d as the Conservative party continued to be engulfed in a slew of sleaze allegations. Johnson skipped a parliamentary debate on the sleaze row on Monday, but yesterday he said MPs who broke the rules \u201cshould be punished\u201d. Cox insists he has acted within the rules.\nThe prime minister did not defend Cox, the former attorney general who has been under fire after it emerged he spent a month in the British Virgin Islands this year doing paid legal work. Cox, who is a QC, has reported earnings for his second job of \u00a3930,588 in 2021 so far. In a statement he insisted that he \u201cregularly works 70-hour weeks and always ensures that his casework on behalf of his constituents is given primary importance and fully carried out\u201d. Here\u2019s an explainer about the main controversies around his second job.\nCop breakthrough \u2013 In a remarkable turnaround at the Cop26 climate summit, China and the US announced a surprise plan to work together on cutting greenhouse gas emissions in the crucial next decade. Talks are still going on over a draft outcome in Glasgow but news that the world\u2019s two biggest emitters will cooperate closely on the emissions cuts needed in the next 10 years to stay within 1.5C could galvanise negotiators towards a deal. World leaders and experts welcomed the agreement but some called for more details. Earlier, Chinese leader Xi Jinping warned against a return to cold war-era tensions in the Asia-Pacific, but urged greater cooperation on pandemic recovery and the climate crisis.\nNHS \u2018breaking point\u2019 \u2013 Nine out of 10 NHS chief executives, chairs and directors say the service is under unsustainable pressure and patient safety is being put at risk. The health service has hit \u201cbreaking point\u201d, the leaders say in a survey, with record numbers of patients seeking care. The use of whole genome sequencing could save the NHS millions of pounds, according to a study which found that a quarter of people with rare illnesses received a diagnosis for their condition through the technology.\nMeghan apology \u2013 The Duchess of Sussex has apologised in court for failing to remember authorising a senior aide to brief the authors of her and Harry\u2019s unofficial biography. Meghan submitted a statement in which she said she could not remember emails between her and her then press secretary about the unauthorised book. But the court of appeal heard that the royal couple\u2019s former communications secretary provided information on a \u201croutine basis\u201d to the authors of Finding Freedom. The court is hearing an appeal by Associated Newspapers to force a trial over Meghan\u2019s claims against the Mail on Sunday of breach of privacy and copyright.\nTesla selloff \u2013 Tesla boss Elon Musk has sold about $5bn worth of shares in the company, days after he polled Twitter users about selling 10% of his stake. In his first share sale since 2016, Musk\u2019s trust sold nearly 3.6m shares in Tesla, worth around $4bn, while he also sold another 934,000 shares for $1.1bn. Musk polled Twitter users on Saturday about selling 10% of his stake, helping to push down Tesla\u2019s share price. But filings show some of the stock sale was planned in September\nDino doctor \u2013 A new species of dinosaur with an extremely large nose has been identified by a retired doctor who spent lockdown rummaging through boxes of ancient bones. Jeremy Lockwood, who is studying for a PhD, decided to catalogue every iguanodon bone discovered on the Isle of Wight. He found a specimen with a unique \u201cbulbous\u201d nasal bone and eventually discovered that it was a new species, which has been named Brighstoneus simmondsi.\nDuring the second world war, Chinese sailors served alongside their British allies in the merchant navy, keeping supply lines open to the UK. But after the war hundreds of them who had settled in Liverpool suddenly disappeared. Now their children are piecing together the truth.\nSorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen $https://audio.guim.co.uk/2021/11/10-70936-20211111TIFchinese.mp3\nIts gurus increasingly promote vaccine scepticism, conspiracy theories and the myth that ill people have themselves to blame. Sirin Kale investigates how the well-being industry turned so nasty.\nEoin Morgan said his England side were devastated after losing a thrilling and desperately close T20 World Cup semi-final to a New Zealand side turbo-boosted to glory by an innings of swashbuckling brilliance by Jimmy Neesham. Pakistan face underdogs Australia in the other semi-final today. Arsenal\u2019s manager, Jonas Eidevall, praised the impact of the 500-strong away contingent present for their 5-1 win over the organised Danish champions HB K\u00f8ge in the Women\u2019s Champions League. Paris St-Germain women\u2019s midfielder Aminata Diallo has been taken into custody for questioning by Versailles police after an attack on one of the club\u2019s players last week. Aston Villa are confident of naming Steven Gerrard on a long-term deal as their new manager.\nWorld Rugby is being urged to help bridge the widening north-south financial divide by confirming Australia as the host nation of the 2027 men\u2019s Rugby World Cup. Sam Underhill says England are dealing with Covid disruption before their match against Australia on Saturday by facing the problem head-on. UK Athletics\u2019 controversial chief executive Jo Coates was earning a salary package of \u00a3226,163 before she resigned last month, making her one of the highest paid administrators in British Olympic sport, the Guardian can reveal. Tyson Fury was \u201cvery badly injured\u201d going into his knockout victory over Deontay Wilder last month and has since undergone elbow surgery to correct the problem. And Gerald Sinstadt, one of the most recognisable sports commentators for BBC and ITV for more than 40 years, has died aged 91.\nPressure on central banks to raise rates looks certain to increase after rising energy costs and supply shortages sent inflation surging in the US and China. The news sent the US dollar soaring, which means the pound is down to $1.340 and \u20ac1.168. The outlook for the FTSE100 is flat this morning. Monitoring of workers and setting performance targets through algorithms is damaging employees\u2019 mental health and needs to be controlled by new legislation, according to MPs and peers.\nThere is a divide among the papers today with several leading on the sleaze latest, including the Guardian: \u201cMP Cox made at least \u00a36m from his second job\u201d. The Mail sticks the boot into the government with \u201c\u00a35.5m MP with no shame\u201d and the Mirror\u2019s splash is \u201cExposed: Tory MP\u2019s homes greed\u201d.The i warns \u201cChief whip in peril over MP moonlighting in Caribbean\u201d.

        "content": "Yorkshire CCC\u2019s chaos is a world away from work done by believers in the game\u2019s ability to bring communities together\nIn late September, on one of the last good days of the summer, a 15-year-old girl called Rhia Sedha scored a 50 at Lord\u2019s. Sedha was captaining the Bradford Girls under-15s in the final of a tournament run by the MCC Foundation for state school cricketers. She and her team made 135 from their 20 overs, then bowled out their opposition from the Cotswolds for 24.\nIn Bradford cricket, they already knew all about Sedha. The Asian Express has been following her for years, from playing in the back garden with her father, Deepak, through school, club and district cricket, the seven for none she took for Shadwell, her hat-trick for Bradford Academy, her debut for Yorkshire, her dream of playing for the England Women\u2019s team.\nIn 2013, Yorkshire celebrated their 150th anniversary. To mark it, the Guardian published a short editorial that consisted entirely of one long list of great Yorkshire players. They were all men. Martyn Moxon is on the list, so is Michael Vaughan. If the club makes it through another 50 years maybe Sedha will be too. Yorkshire cricket belongs to her, just as much as it does to Vaughan; she has a claim on its future, he has a claim on its past.\nThe Guardian has reported on several cases of discrimination in cricket in the past few years. The Yorkshire story is depressingly familiar, but the sport it describes still feels utterly unrecognisable.\nIt is not the game Sedha was playing at Lord\u2019s. It is not the game we saw during the World Cup in 2019, won by an England team led by an Irish-born captain and included first- and second- and third-generation immigrants from Barbados, South Africa, New Zealand and Pakistan, and when almost every other ticket was brought by a member of the south Asian diaspora. It\u2019s not the sport I recognise from all the work I\u2019ve done reporting on English cricket in the past 10 years, at schools in Hartlepool and leisure centres in Wolverhampton, village greens in Suffolk and Hampshire, and city pitches in Burnley and London.\nI don\u2019t believe English cricket has \u201cgone backwards\u201d. It\u2019s not what I\u2019ve seen in the work of the MCC Foundation, the Lord\u2019s Taverners, the ACE programme, Chance to Shine or, indeed, the Yorkshire Cricket Foundation, which last week were at the Infinity Centre in Harehills, putting on football and cricket workshops for a group of 140 Afghan refugees who have just arrived in Leeds. The YCF were recently shortlisted for the Yorkshire Post\u2019s excellence in business awards because of their work delivering cricket coaching to underprivileged children across the county.\nAnd it\u2019s not what I\u2019ve heard in off-the-record conversations with staff at Yorkshire and on-the-record conversations with people across the game in the past few days. In Yorkshire, there is genuine fury that the progress made has been so badly undermined by the stubborn refusal of senior management at the club, and at the ECB, to deal with this situation head-on until now. The problem at Yorkshire isn\u2019t just that players discriminated against players from Asian backgrounds, it\u2019s that the management oversaw a culture that allowed that behaviour to pass and made such a mess of their opportunity to address it when it first arose.\nThere are plenty of people in cricket, hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands, who share that anger and who are sick of the institutional failures we\u2019ve seen laid bare, again, in the past week, sick of the managerial class who have known about these problems for 25 years and more and are saying the same old things about how something needs to be done. Truth is, English cricket, and Yorkshire cricket, is already full of people who have been getting on and doing it.\nKamlesh Patel mentioned one of them on Monday, in his first press conference as Yorkshire chairman, when he was asked about Azeem Rafiq\u2019s sister, Amna, who works as a community and development manager for the Yorkshire Cricket Board and is on sick leave because of the stress she\u2019s been put under while her brother has been pursuing his case against the club.\nLord Patel already knows her. \u201cShe\u2019s dynamic, and from my knowledge, what she did at Leicestershire, going out there, and working with the Asian women, that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about,\u201d he said. Maybe you know her. We ran a short film about her work in 2017.\nI\u2019ve met dozens of people like her in just the past year. Ebony Rainford-Brent, who got so fed up at listening to all the talk about the lack of black British players that she decided to set up the ACE programme, is one. Sarah Fane, who spent years building school pitches in Afghanistan and now runs the MCC Foundation, is another. Will Gaffney, who has set up his own charity distributing cricket kit to underprivileged kids, is another. John Claughton, a former headmaster who is now running a programme that opens up private school facilities to local state-run junior schools, is another. There are countless more.\nThe ECB announced this week that it is launching a call for evidence about experiences of discrimination in the game. It is necessary, but it is not sufficient. What it needs to be doing is talking to the people \u2013 and there are plenty of them working in their own headquarters \u2013 who love the sport, who believe in its ability to bring communities together and who are out there, every day, working to make it better.\nFind them, listen to them, give them more attention, more resources and more responsibility. Because the game they play moved on from all this a long time ago.",

        "content": "French adventurer revolutionised undersea film-making and sounded early alarm over oceans\u2019 destruction\nHe was the French adventurer who plumbed the depths of the world\u2019s oceans to introduce us to a magical and previously unseen universe under the sea. Commander Jacques-Yves Cousteau, the former naval officer turned inventor of the Aqualung and scuba equipment and then television explorer, became a hero to generations of children who were mesmerised by his adventures and groundbreaking films.\nNow a new documentary explores his life and legacy, showing how more than half a century ago Cousteau sounded the alarm over the destruction of the oceans, which he saw as vital to the future of the human race.\nWhile a young David Attenborough captivated viewers fascinated by nature on land, Cousteau, with his red beanie and weatherworn profile at the helm of the Calypso, was the old man of the sea, co-star to shoals of colourful fish, sharks and coral reefs in The Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau.\n\u201cUndersea film-making was extraordinarily rudimentary before Cousteau came along and revolutionised it. It\u2019s hard to remember now, but this was a totally new world he showed us,\u201d said Liz Garbus, the award-winning director of the new film about the oceanographer, Becoming Cousteau.\nIn the 1970s, after decades diving and exploring and at the height of his fame, Cousteau changed tack: instead of simply showing and sharing his exploits, he began worrying about and warning of the damage humanity was doing to the planet. Today, as world leaders gather in Glasgow to discuss the climate emergency, Cousteau\u2019s fears for the future of the marine environment seem prescient but ignored. At the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio, the oceanographer \u2013 nicknamed \u201cCaptain Planet\u201d \u2013 was received as a hero and was the only non-politician in the official portrait.\n\u201cCousteau was warning about the dangers of climate change even before those two words were used together in a sentences, before we had this notion of global warming,\u201d Garbus said. \u201cHe became an ardent environmentalist well before his time.\u201d\nCousteau, who died at 87 in 1997, began his career in the navy training to be a pilot, an ambition cut short by a serious car accident when he was in his mid-20s. Part of his physical rehabilitation was swimming and Cousteau developed a love of diving, developing the first Aqualung, and after the second world war setting off to explore the world\u2019s seas and oceans in the Calypso, a converted minesweeper.\nThe 90-minute National Geographic Documentary film, released in UK cinemas from 12 November, reveals how Cousteau aimed to become the John Ford or John Huston of the marine world, developing the first underwater cameras and inventing new ways of filming. For many it was the first time they had ever seen the wonders of the deep. But, short of money in the 1950s and wishing to keep the Calypso and his research afloat, Cousteau accepted funding from British Petroleum to help look for oil in the Gulf. Reflecting later on the environmental damage wreaked by offshore oil exploration, he would come to regret the decision. \u201cI think I was naive \u2026 but we didn\u2019t have a penny,\u201d he says in the film.\nCousteau and his band of adventurers\u2019 early interactions with marine life would be considered unacceptable today: footage shows them setting off dynamite charges to kill fish, \u201criding\u201d turtles and, in the Oscar-winning 1956 documentary The Silent World, revelling in the killing of a shark that fought to the death.\nNor does the film gloss over his personal failings. Cousteau had many talents; being a family man, attentive father and faithful husband were not among them. His two sons, Jean-Michel and Philippe \u2013 the latter who worked with his father and who died in a plane crash in 1979 \u2013 were sent to boarding school while the workaholic Cousteau and his wife Simone sailed the oceans. He married his second wife, Francine, shortly after Simone died of cancer, by which time he already had two children with her.\nAfter the death of his son, Cousteau\u2019s films became darker, more pessimistic about the fate of humans, which he saw as inextricably linked to a disappearing underwater world.\nThe Oscar-nominated Garbus, who has been responsible for portraits of Nina Simone and Marilyn Monroe among others, said she had grown up on Cousteau\u2019s extraordinary documentaries but realised when reading a story about him to her son that he had \u201creceded into the woodwork, disappeared completely\u201d from the public domain. \u201cI went online and I couldn\u2019t find anything much about him there either,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI wanted to explore how he moved from his early start as a conquering adventurer to someone who was an ardent environmentalist ahead of his time,\u201d Garbus said. \u201cHe changed from not just showing and sharing but protecting. In the 1970s he starts talking about having been diving for decades and observing reefs dying and species of fish that were plentiful disappearing. He was the most popular voice for conservation in the 1970s and then he just disappeared.\u201d\nGarbus said Cousteau\u2019s enduring importance was as a \u201cnon-partisan figure uniting us around this issue\u201d, a powerful role she believes nobody can fill today.\n\u201cHis legacy is up to us. Is it a Cassandra story of someone warning of impending doom and the world not listening, or a story that we take action, but too late, but still some action?\n\u201cAs Cousteau says, you will only protect what you love. He brought us closer to the undersea world and its creatures, and now we do love it and want to protect it and that\u2019s thanks to him. That\u2019s his legacy.\u201d",

Southern Water, which runs services from Kent to Hampshire, will repay \u00a346m, while South West Water will repay \u00a315m.\nWater companies hold a monopoly on supply in their areas, meaning customers are unable to switch to a competitor if they are dissatisfied with the service provided. Instead, the regulator has devised the system of penalties to ensure the companies, many of which are privately owned, have an incentive to invest rather than maximising dividend payments.\nFor instance, Thames Water was penalised for failing to stop sewers from flooding, for missing customer service targets, and for failing to generate enough renewable energy.\nEnglish water companies have handed more than \u00a32bn a year on average to shareholders since they were privatised three decades ago, according to analysis for the Guardian last year.\nThames Water is owned by a series of investment funds, led by pension funds for Ontario retirees and UK academics as well as Abu Dhabi\u2019s sovereign wealth fund. Macquarie Asset Management, part of an Australian investment bank, bought a majority stake in Southern Water in August. South West Water is owned by Pennon Group, a FTSE 250-listed company.\nThe repayments will not be delivered directly to customers but rather will affect the amount that companies can charge during the 2022-23 financial year.\nOfwat said it had decided to defer incentive bonuses that would have added \u00a344m and \u00a3323,000 to the bills of customers of Severn Trent Water and Portsmouth Water respectively.\nThe biggest outperformers were Severn Trent, the north-west of England provider United Utilities, which will be allowed to charge an extra \u00a321m, and the east of England provider Anglian Water, at \u00a312m.\nOfwat also said it would make determinations on company performance on water consumption targets at the end of the 2020-25 period, after the coronavirus pandemic played havoc with water usage patterns.\n This article was amended on 11 November 2021. The original headline and article referred to British water firms, but Ofwat only covers English and Welsh water firms.",

        "content": "According to recent research, two-thirds of US workers are being denied  adjustments on account of their pregnancy\nJennifer, a family nurse practitioner in Texas, told her employer a few months into the Covid-19 pandemic that she was pregnant and requested changes to her work to limit her exposure to Covid-19.\nBut it didn\u2019t work.\n\u201cOut of the blue, when I was about seven months pregnant, my employer reassigned me from a low-risk area with low exposure risk, to a high-risk area,\u201d said Jennifer, who requested to withhold her last name due to privacy concerns. \u201cI made it very clear to them that I wanted to continue working, that I just needed safety measures to prevent me from getting ill, and they were actually less safety measures than they had given a male doctor that I worked with who had an autoimmune condition.\u201d\nInstead of providing her with accommodations to her work that would reflect her pregnancy, her managers held a meeting at which Jennifer claims she was told she was no good to them pregnant, and that she should take unpaid family medical leave as she was going to be replaced by a non-pregnant worker. She had worked at the employer for five years.\n\u201cI went home that night and I just cried,\u201d she added. \u201cI had no idea what I was going to do because I was actually a high-risk pregnancy and needed health insurance.\u201d\nDue to the pandemic, Jennifer\u2019s husband wasn\u2019t working as often, and her family relied on her income and health insurance. At seven months pregnant during the first few months of the Covid-19 pandemic, leaving to find another job wasn\u2019t immediately an option.\nShe was able to receive a note from her OB/GYN confirming to her employer that her pregnancy was high-risk, and demanded accommodations under the Americans with Disabilities Act. Though her employer provided some accommodations in response, she still felt exposed to Covid-19 at work. After her pregnancy, Jennifer opted to find another job, despite taking a pay cut to do so, for fear she would be forced out or intimidated from her position in retaliation by her employer.\nJennifer is far from alone in America.\nAccording to a recent research brief conducted by the legal advocacy non-profit, A Better Balance, approximately two-thirds of pregnant workers are being denied work accommodations under current federal law, either forcing these workers out of their jobs or putting them and their pregnancy at risk.\nUnder the Americans with Disabilities Act, pregnant workers with medical needs, but not disabilities, are left unprotected to prevent pregnancy complications. The burden is placed on individual pregnant workers to prove someone else in their workplace received similar accommodations in order to receive them.\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has further exposed the issues facing women in the workplace, including a lack of any mandated paid maternity leave, high childcare costs and a lack of access to childcare, and women, particularly women of color, have been disproportionately affected by job losses and jobs recovery for women.\nIn September 2021, more than 300,000 women in the US left the workforce. More than 26,000 jobs were lost in September 2021 for women, while men gained 220,000 jobs. The wage gap between men and women through 2020 was 83 cents to $1, with Black women paid 64 cents for every dollar paid to white men, and Latino women paid 57 cents for every dollar paid to white men. Over 12.6 million women and girls in the US had no health insurance coverage through 2020.\nFederal legislation to require employers to provide reasonable accommodations to employees for pregnancy, childbirth and related medical conditions, the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, passed in the House of Representatives in May 2021 with bipartisan support, but has not yet received a vote in the Senate.\n\u201cWe need one clear, federal standard to ensure that all pregnant workers are entitled to this basic protection,\u201d said Dina Bakst, co-founder and co-president of A Better Balance. \u201cFar too many have been and continue to be forced off the job because their employers refuse to provide them the modest accommodations they need to stay healthy and the pandemic has exacerbated the dire nature of this situation.\u201d\nIn a recent report published by the National Women\u2019s Law Center, the most common occupations for pregnant workers, registered nurses, teachers, cashiers, retail workers, servers, are often low-paid and require physically demanding job duties. Black and Latino pregnant workers are disproportionately in low-paid jobs where workers are forced to stand for long periods of time, make repetitive motions and are exposed to disease or infections.\nElizabeth Rocha worked at an Amazon warehouse in Tracy, California, when she found out she was pregnant in March 2016. Due to morning sickness and the physically demanding nature of her job, she informed her management immediately. Two weeks into working, she was pushed to take an unpaid leave of absence to get medication for morning sickness.\nAs her pregnancy progressed, Rocha requested to be stationed near a restroom, but management didn\u2019t move her. Then she started getting written up for time off task because she was using the restroom frequently, and she was constantly forced to stow heavy items.\nShe tried to obtain a stool to help her stow items, but was told a different department needed it more, and her requests to have her rate lowered were dismissed. Two weeks before she was scheduled for maternity leave, her accommodation for a 10-minute bathroom break once an hour was finally approved, but she was put on a stowing station with heavy, bulk items like gaming systems, cat litter and fertilizer.\nAfter returning from maternity leave in early 2017, Rocha was eventually fired due to too many write-ups for missing her rate.\n\u201cI thought I was having trouble because it was my first pregnancy and I didn\u2019t know what to expect, so I didn\u2019t want to cause too much trouble or ask for too much,\u201d said Rocha. \u201cAt about four months in the pregnancy and on I would only get sick on the days that I would work. I know now that was due to stress and anxiety from fear of being written up and fired.\u201d",

He leaves with the club top and as they prepare for the League Cup semi-final against Hibernian on Sunday week.\nVilla made Gerrard their top target as they attempt to climb away from 16th place, two points above the relegation zone, after finishing 11th last season. Gerrard\u2019s first game will be at home to Brighton a week on Saturday.\nThe former Liverpool captain is due to take Villa to Anfield on 11 December. He has a connection at Villa to Christian Purslow, the chief executive, who worked as Liverpool\u2019s managing director for a number of years while Gerrard was at the club.\nGerrard said: \u201cAston Villa is a club with a rich history and tradition in English football and I am immensely proud to become its new head coach. In my conversations with [the owners] Nassef [Sawiris], Wes [Edens] and the rest of the board, it was apparent how ambitious their plans are for the club and I am looking forward to helping them achieve their aims.\n\u201cI would like to express my sincere gratitude to everybody associated with Glasgow Rangers for giving me the opportunity to manage such an iconic football club.

I would like to wish the players, staff and supporters the very best for the future.\u201d\nPurslow referenced the time Gerrard spent working with young players at Liverpool as he welcomed him to Villa, describing that as \u201cexperience we value highly\u201d.\nPurslow said: \u201cHe then took the brave decision to test himself in the intense and high-pressured environment of the Scottish Old Firm. His subsequent achievement in winning the Premiership title with Glasgow Rangers really caught our eye as did his experience in Europe.\n\u201cIt has been very clear in our discussions with him that Steven\u2019s coaching ambitions, philosophy and values entirely match those of Aston Villa. We are excited he has agreed to lead us in the next phase of our ambitious plans as we look to build on the progress made since Nassef Sawiris and Wes Edens took over the club in 2018.\u201d\nThe Rangers chairman, Douglas Park, thanked Gerrard and said: \u201cHe has provided us all with some unforgettable moments, not least his delivery of the Scottish Premiership title back to Ibrox last season having not lost a match in the entire league campaign. In European competition, he has restored the good name and credibility of our club on the continent and leaves us in a very healthy position on the pitch.\u201d",

However, like-for-like store sales rose by only 6% year on year in the second half of that period.\nShares slumped by 5%, making it one of the biggest fallers on the FTSE 100 on Thursday.\nThe company blamed Covid-19 restrictions in the Asia-Pacific region for the sales difficulties. In China, a key market for luxury goods, restrictions were \u201cespecially impactful [\u2026] reducing footfall materially, leading to an adverse effect on revenues\u201d, the company said. However, it added that there was a \u201cgood recovery\u201d in September.\nIn-store sales in Europe, the Middle East, India and Africa also continued to struggle, down by 25% in the latest financial quarter.\nZuzanna Pusz at UBS, an investment bank, noted that Burberry\u2019s like-for-like sales growth \u201clooks rather weak\u201d compared with peers.\nRichard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, an investment platform, said the share price drop reflected the \u201cweakening of sales during the second quarter, even though numbers for the first-half as a whole are in comfortably positive territory\u201d. It also suffered from \u201cgenerally high expectations\u201d.\nBurberry is in the process of switching management, after it poached the head of Versace, Jonathan Akeroyd, to take over as chief executive from Marco Gobbetti, who was part way through a turnaround plan aimed at taking Burberry further upmarket, with prices to rival its French and Italian rivals. Gobbetti will step down at the end of the year, after saying he wanted to return home to Italy.\nThe move upmarket for the British brand \u2013 best known for its trenchcoats and signature check \u2013 has meant the company has reduced discounts, focusing instead on growth in products sold at full price.\nGerry Murphy, Burberry\u2019s chair, said the company \u201cmade strong progress in the half\u201d. Murphy, who will oversee the company from January until Akeroyd starts in April, highlighted \u201cdouble-digit percentage\u201d growth in full-price sales, which he said was generating fatter profit margins on products.\nHe added: \u201cWe are seeing an acceleration in performance in countries less impacted by travel restrictions and we remain confident of achieving our medium-term goals.\u201d\nBurberry also reinstated its dividend and restarted a share buyback programme.",

It has not changed since then.\nOn Friday, Ontario\u2019s court of appeal ruled unanimously that the meagre payments were a violation of the spirit of the treaty: to share the wealth generated from the territory.\nThe case has now been sent back to a trial judge to determine how much money the nearly 40,000 Anishinaabe descended from nations that ceded the territory are owed \u2013 a figure will probably be in the billions of dollars. It is not yet clear if the federal government, the government of Ontario, or both, will be required to pay the compensation.\nAt a press conference on Tuesday, Chief Dean Sayers of the Batchewana First Nation hailed the court victory as \u201can incredible moment in the history of our lands here in Canada\u201d and said the decision represented a long-overdue chance for Anishinabek people to \u201creclai[m] our inheritances\u201d.\nThe treaty, named after fur-trader-turned-politician William Benjamin Robinson, who negotiated with Indigenous communities, covers 35,700 square miles of land and grants Indigenous communities the rights to hunt and fish the land \u2013 as well as an annual \u201crent\u201d paid to each person.\nIn the 171 years since the treaty was signed, the land on the north shores of Lake Huron and Lake Superior has become a valuable source of revenue for the mining and forestry industries.\nBut despite the immense revenues generated by industry, remote First Nations communities live in abysmal conditions, sometimes lacking access to clean drinking water.\n\u201cObviously, the Anishinaabe would not have expected their communities to suffer a range of deprivations, including substandard housing and boil water advisories, while non-Indigenous communities thrived,\u201d the court said. \u201cNor was it likely, based on the Anishinaabe principles discussed by the trial judge, that the Anishinaabe would have wished to enjoy great personal wealth while their fellow Canadians suffered deprivation.\u201d\nThe high court victory marks the latest win for the litigants, who have \u201cwon every step of the process\u201d in the multi-year fight, Mike Restoule, chair of the Robinson Huron Treaty Litigation Fund, told reporters.\nOntario\u2019s attorney general\u2019s office says it is reviewing the decision, but could not comment on a matter before the courts. The federal government has indicated it is willing to discuss a settlement if Ontario agrees to participate in the talks.\n\u201cWe know it is the time now for the government of Ontario to embrace the reality, to embrace the facts, to embrace the history and also embrace the rule of law,\u201d said the Wiikwemkoong chief Duke Peltier.\nOntario has 60 days to appeal the ruling, which would send the case to Canada\u2019s supreme court \u2013 but Indigenous leaders have instead called on the provincial government to join them at the bargaining table.\nThere is also mounting pressure on various levels of government to not appeal against court rulings that affirm Indigenous rights or significant final settlements due to those communities.\nJustin Trudeau\u2019s Liberal government has faced sharp criticism for its recent decision to appeal against a ruling that would pave the way for a huge compensation payment to Indigenous children who suffered in foster care.",

        "content": "Graham Arnold once called Parramatta Stadium a \u201clittle shed\u201d. In 2015, back before Pirtek Stadium was demolished, the then Sydney FC coach had a cute pre-Sydney derby crack at the Wanderers\u2019 21,000-capacity home ground. Six years later its successor, CommBank Stadium, hosted his Australian team\u2019s long-awaited homecoming that was tipped to make or break their World Cup qualifying campaign but instead offered little insight into the road from here to Qatar 2022.\nThis venue, with its steep stands and capacity to hold 30,000, was made for moments of grandeur, and this perhaps should have been one of them. It was the Socceroos\u2019 first home match in 763 days, since before the start of the pandemic. They rarely lose here \u2013 in home World Cup qualifiers it has happened only once in the past 40 years. Victory would have set them on course for automatic qualification ahead of next Wednesday morning\u2019s tie with China.\nWhat the Socceroos got was undefeated Saudi Arabia on a wet Thursday night. What could possibly go wrong? As it turned out, a nil-nil draw and a grave-looking knee injury to defender Harry Souttar that could well have longer-term ramifications. It was not all bad for the 23,314 in attendance. A loss would have had greater implications in terms of the group maths. As it stands Australia remain second in Group B, three points behind the Saudis and on equal goal difference. But the tourists asked Australia serious questions and the answers were not always forthcoming. When they were, momentum was disrupted by stoppages and gamesmanship, and Souttar\u2019s late exit set off a 10-minute tightrope walk relying mostly on Mat Ryan\u2019s impeccable balance.\nThe draw was a fair result on the balance of play, during which momentum shifted back and forth, but the visitors will leave the more content, with one foot already in Qatar. For the Socceroos, this was an opportunity missed to right the ship after last month\u2019s loss to Japan, which snapped their world-record streak of 11 matches. Despite their sustained pressure, it was also one relatively scant on gilt-edged chances, with Mat Leckie probably coming the closest in the second half.\nIn the absence of Aaron Mooy and Tom Rogic, and largely unable to play through the midfield, Australia made inroads down the left via Awer Mabil and Ajdin Hrustic. But the cheeky backheels and attractive attacking plays repeatedly promised more than they delivered, and the final ball too often dissipated as quickly as the Saudi defence snapped back into shape. They did not park the bus but they were impervious, guarding their box diligently as their manager, Herv\u00e9 Renard, motioned from his dugout. The Frenchman, dressed like James Bond and just as cool in temperament, opted to sit undercover in the dry. His tracksuit-clad counterpart, Arnold, braved the wet, pacing his technical area as Martin Boyle played the ball across goal to Hrustic and the latter\u2019s first-time attempt failed to trouble Mohammed Al-Yami.\nThis was effectively the essence of the contest. Some good things were there, others were not. Salem Al-Dawsari, though, was all the things. The vision. The pace. The passing. The Al-Hilal winger pursued a long ball all the way to the corner flag and then wooed it gently back in play, continuing the dreamy courtship along the byline. It was much to the chagrin of Rhyan Grant, who played the part of third wheel in unrequited love as the ball continued to evade him and sailed across the face of Ryan\u2019s goal. Grant otherwise made himself more than a mild inconvenience at full-back and might also have scored in the first minute had his shot from distance not sailed over the bar.\nThe consistency of the rain ensured a surface more slippery even than Al-Dawsari. Had this venue been an actual shed the corrugated iron would have made for some serious noise. Instead it was provided by the 3,000 or so Saudi supporters congregated in the upper tier at the south end. The north end was somewhat more subdued, a throng behind some green-and-gold safe smoke and a \u201cno place like home\u201d tifo.\nIt took some skullduggery to rouse the home fans into voice, a chorus of \u201cbullshit\u201d after defender Abdulelah Al-Amri hit the deck and then went into the book for an altercation with Leckie. When Abdulelah Al-Malki went down moments later \u2013 again in combat with the Australian forward \u2013 it was enough to get even Renard off his seat.\nLeckie, who opted out of travelling overseas for the four qualifiers in September and October due to quarantine restrictions, was lively on his return and very nearly broke the deadlock on the hour, turning his marker only to be denied by Al-Yami. The Saudi goalkeeper was soon on the money again in a double save to stop Mabil\u2019s long-range free kick and Boyle\u2019s follow-up, which ricocheted off a defender and behind for a corner.\nBut the Saudis soon had the ascendancy and, as Salman al Faraj drew a crucial block from Ryan, Souttar was felled in the action clutching at the back of his knee and promptly stretchered off, leaving both the player and coaching staff nervously awaiting scan results in the coming days.",

Exactly how the rewilded park will look depends on a future public consultation but the process could include the creation of new habitats, such as woodlands, grasslands, scrubland and wetlands (which will provide nesting sites for songbirds), more trees, walking and cycling trails, community orchards and vegetable-growing areas, and the possible reintroduction of such species as water voles, dormice, harvest mice, red kites and red-backed shrikes.\nRewilding work, which aims to restore entire ecosystems, often focuses on countryside areas. But rewilding in urban environments is seen by many as key to a better future for people, wildlife and the planet. \u201cGiven the biodiversity crisis, the climate emergency and the mounting pressures facing our health service, urban greenspace rewilding should be a top priority for all city authorities,\u201d said Driver. \u201cOn a scale such as Allestree, rewilding can make an important contribution to mitigating the impacts of climate change through carbon sequestration, and to soil and water quality through the cessation of chemical and fertiliser applications on the land.\u201d\nRewilding parts of towns and cities brings direct benefits to the people who live in them, according to Driver. \u201cIt\u2019s hugely important to people, as well as wildlife, that we take the opportunity to rewild green spaces in our cities wherever possible,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s enough evidence out there to tell us that nature-rich green space is so much more valuable for health and wellbeing than boring \u2018kick-about\u2019 rye grass fields, especially in terms of mental wellbeing.\n\u201cWe know that as time passes our population is becoming more urbanised and losing contact with the natural world. Rewilding accessible sites, like Allestree, within city boundaries will help residents re-establish their contact with nature, and increase people\u2019s understanding and respect for our natural environment.\u201d\nDerbyshire Wildlife Trust sees the project as part of a \u201cNatural Health Service\u201d. \u201cBeing outdoors makes us feel good,\u201d said Smith. \u201cHearing birdsong, watching a red kite soar or catching a glimpse of a summer butterfly reduces blood pressure and helps us relax. We need nature as much as it needs us.\u201d\nThe ambitious urban rewilding project at Allestree should inspire other councils to follow the lead, said Smith. \u201cDerby city council has taken a bold step at a really important time. Once we show what can be achieved, we can provide a blueprint for other councils to follow.\n\u201cWe want to share what we learn and help others take similar steps. Imagine what we could achieve if all our urban parks became just a little bit wilder.\u201d\nFind more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",

        "content": "Analysis: The fact that figures for Q3 compare unfavourably with other large economies must worry the chancellor\nGrowth is up, said Rishi Sunak in his budget speech last month, but the figures for the third-quarter show this claim is no longer true.\nThe rise in national income, or GDP, of 1.3% in the three months to September was down from 5.5% in the previous quarter. It meant the recovery from the worst slump in 300 years slowed over the summer and in a troubling development, is now on a much lower trajectory.\nIt must worry the chancellor, less than a month on from his upbeat declarations in the budget, that the pace of growth has slowed dramatically and that one of his other measures of success, namely how well the country is doing in relation to its G7 counterparts, puts the UK at the bottom of the league.\nAll the major economies have recovered more quickly than the UK economy, which remains 2.1% below its pre-pandemic peak.\nGermany and Italy are 1.5% and 1.4% below their pre-pandemic best while the US has jumped ahead to be in positive territory by 1.4%.\nOur closest neighbour, France, which looks and feels economically most like the UK, is only 0.1% below where it was before Covid-19 forced governments to impose wide ranging lockdowns.\nOur European neighbours keep more in reserve to cope with the bad times, preventing a deep slump when a financial disaster strikes. The US government, just as it did in the financial crash of 2008, allows the slump to wipe out businesses and jobs, but then does so much more to turn the situation around.\nSunak said he had a plan for growth \u201cthat builds a stronger economy for the future\u201d. At the time it sounded presumptive, given the puny support for the economy from his various tax and spending measures. Today that statement is likely to ring distinctly hollow among businesses in the manufacturing and construction sectors where growth slipped backwards in the third quarter.\nShort-time working in the car industry and the mothballing of construction projects outside the excessively profitable housebuilding sector have left these two bedrock industries struggling.\nDuring the quarter the manufacturing sector contracted by 0.3%. Construction slumped by an even sharper 1.5%.\nAnother quarter dominated by a lack of skilled staff and a shortage of vital materials and components to work with, and both sectors will likely contract for a second successive quarter in the final three months of 2021, fulfilling the definition of a recession for each one.\nThe Conservative narrative is that there is not much Sunak can do to help employers fill vacancies in the short term. Nor can he manipulate the global trading system to ease bottlenecks.\nThat would be true without Brexit. The government\u2019s adoption of the hardest of Brexits has cut the supply lines of skilled staff that would have eased the manufacturing and construction industries through the pandemic.\nA hard Brexit has also persuaded many of our European trading partners to turn away from Britain. This can be seen in the quarterly trade figures, which are so bad they drag on growth.\nAna Boata, head of economic research at the credit insurer Euler Hermes, said trade barriers would almost certainly push the UK\u2019s manufacturing recession.\nThe lack of goods coming into the country would also contribute to higher inflation, which the Bank of England says will reach 5% by next spring, she said.\nIt is reasonable for voters to ask why the government is battling the EU over article 16, risking a trade war with the most important destination for our goods and services, when the UK\u2019s industrial base is contracting and households are staring at a year of falling living standards.\nAt the moment the government shows no sign of budging.",

They say hard-pressed ambulance services are seeing surgeries as \u201cplaces of safety\u201d and taking longer to send paramedics there, because they are so busy dealing with other emergencies and assume GPs and nurses are looking after the patient.\nIn some cases GPs have become so worried by the long delay for an ambulance that they have ended up driving the patient from their practice to A&E themselves.\nThe British Medical Association (BMA) and Royal College of GPs (RCGP) voiced alarm at the recent rise in very sick patients getting stuck on their premises and said the patients could face irreparable harm to their health because they had not been transported to hospital fast enough.\nThey want ambulance services to stop regarding GP surgeries as \u201cplaces of safety\u201d and start treating patients stuck there as just as much of a priority as those who are in trouble elsewhere.\nDr Richard Vautrey, the chair of the BMA\u2019s general practitioners committee, said: \u201cGPs and their teams will always do all they can to respond to clinical emergencies. When we have delays in ambulances arriving it means a nurse or GP being taken away from other appointments, and these incidents are increasingly common.\n\u201cIt\u2019s vital that when called for help and support, ambulance services treat calls from surgeries as seriously and quickly as they do that from any other location. Delays not only put individual patients at risk but they also take practice clinicians away from the many other patients they need to attend to.\u201d\nThe incidents are a stark illustration of the pressure NHS ambulance services are under. Ambulance crews are spending huge amounts of time tied up outside hospitals looking after patients because A&Es are too busy to accept them. In late October two patients died in the back of an ambulance while waiting outside Addenbrooke\u2019s hospital in Cambridge and Worcestershire Royal hospital in Worcester.\nDr Joanna Poole, a hospital doctor, tweeted last week about one patient with low oxygen saturation levels waiting for hours, while a man with chest pain was sent in a taxi from his GP\u2019s surgery to the emergency department \u201carresting in car\u201d because the surgeries were seen as \u201csafe places\u201d.\nLast week the medical website Pulse told how Dr Lucy Pocock, a Bristol GP, had taken a six-year-old patient to A&E at 9pm herself after her 999 call at 4.45pm did not yield an ambulance. \u201cI don\u2019t want a patient dying in my care while we wait for an ambulance. It\u2019s not the care I want to give. I don\u2019t want that on my conscience,\u201d Pocock said.\nIn response to her story, Dr Richard Greenway, another GP in Bristol, said: \u201cThis is getting very dangerous.\u201d He said in recent weeks his practice had had several such incidents, including:\nA patient with a fractured hip who waited nine hours in the surgery for an ambulance before the ambulance service sent a taxi instead at 9pm saying \u201cno ambulance available\u201d.\nA patient with chest pains who missed the chance to have stents fitted because, despite them and their GP dialling 999, no ambulance came to take them to hospital.\nA patient with acute heart failure and atrial fibrillation who had to be kept on oxygen in their surgery for more than four hours before an ambulance arrived.\nGPs and practice nurses, despite being highly skilled, cannot give proper care to patients whose life is at risk, Vautrey said. \u201cWhen a patient is suffering with an urgent or serious medical condition such as a heart attack or stroke, they must be treated by specialist services and clinicians as quickly as possible and in the most appropriate setting, such as an emergency department.\u201d\nProf Martin Marshall, the chair of the RCGP, said: \u201cIf a member of staff at a GP surgery calls an ambulance, it\u2019s because a patient needs emergency treatment or care that can\u2019t be delivered at the surgery, and as such it\u2019s vital that these calls aren\u2019t deprioritised, as per some reports we\u2019re hearing about.\n\u201cWhile GP surgeries are clinical settings staffed by highly trained clinicians, practices may not be equipped with all of the equipment or appropriate medications needed in an emergency situation.\u201d\nHe and Vautrey acknowledged that ambulance services were not to blame for the long delays because they are under unsustainable pressure owing to lack of resources and record demand.\nThe Association of Ambulance Chief Executives, which represents England\u2019s 10 ambulance trusts, has been approached for a response.",

        "content": "There was plenty to admire, notably the league title, but it is hard to imagine his CV as a manager alone got him this move\nThe cocksure approach of Old Firm supporters is only occasionally \u2013 and amusingly \u2013 spoked. When Brendan Rodgers decided Leicester City was a more valid career option than seeking to equal, or make, history at Celtic the response was volcanic. Steven Gerrard will be spared such abuse \u2013 the Rangers following go weak at the knees within 500 yards of their now former manager \u2013 but the swapping of Ibrox for Villa Park and Premier League mediocrity still stings. Rangers, fresh from years as an on- and off-field laughing stock, adored the kudos bestowed on them by association with Gerrard. That he chose to walk away is a blow to light blue ego.\nRodgers, it should be noted, departed Glasgow with seven domestic honours \u2013 including two Trebles \u2013 and further Champions League experience. Gerrard has collected one Scottish trophy from a possible nine, with his wider mission as incomplete as it is tricky to evaluate. What he has in common with Rodgers, his former manager, is a debt of gratitude to a club in Glasgow, who did as much to elevate status as was the case in reverse. Rangers were good for Gerrard by providing an environment not widely available elsewhere. If you can manage the Old Firm, you can manage anywhere, as Dick Advocaat once put it.\nShould Rangers win this season\u2019s Scottish top flight, they are almost certain to gain direct entry to the Champions League. Gerrard apparently could not care less, a path back to Anfield not being particularly well served by trouncing Ross County or watching players skate around an artificial pitch at Livingston. As the Rangers support lament Gerrard\u2019s loss, they are entitled to query the timing. It gives credibility to whispers all season that all was not well behind the scenes. One also has to wonder why Gerrard would not be fully confident of retaining the title, given the margin to Celtic at the end of 2020-21 was 25 points.\nJust last month, days after insisting he was \u201chappy\u201d and \u201csettled\u201d, Gerrard broke ranks with the assertion that: \u201cTo compete with the teams we are playing against, we have to spend big money.\u201d His point related to the Europa League. In response, the Rangers hierarchy were entitled to point to a seven-figure salary-bill increase mid-pandemic. The club has a last-reported \u00a348m in staff costs, \u00a333.5m of which relates to the first-team squad. It is a sad indictment of a player-trading model beyond Gerrard\u2019s domain that not a single player was sold for even moderate value during his reign. Gerrard paid only lip service to the development of youth players via the first team. All the while, Rangers were reporting huge financial losses.\nGerrard\u2019s desire to return to England follows logic. He made no effort to forge media relationships in Scotland, a matter linked in part to Rangers\u2019 small-time approach towards press relations. Gerrard\u2019s family remained in England throughout. If the grand plan is to succeed J\u00fcrgen Klopp, Gerrard has cause to believe he needs to be in view of the Liverpool hierarchy. Much of Gerrard\u2019s approach in Scotland made this seem like merely a career stop, where England was the more serious or significant domain. Goodbye Stevie G, we never really knew you at all.\nRelative obscurity in Scotland, however, undoubtedly assisted him. It is the reason, in fact, that his performance at Rangers is widely and lazily depicted as somehow sensational. It would be ludicrous to portray Gerrard\u2019s time at the club as anything other than good, perhaps very good, but context needs to be applied. Rangers supporters protest when an 11% domestic trophy success record is pointed out but this is a club that has always dealt in the currency of winning. St Johnstone claimed two trophies last season. It is perfectly reasonable to ask whether other coaches would have achieved more than or identical to Gerrard with the same ever-increasing resource.\nThe one trophy Gerrard did deliver was key. Rangers\u2019 title success last season may have been the most important in their history. It was the first since the financial implosion of 2012 and stopped Celtic returning a record 10 in succession. Celtic\u2019s fall is an easy reference point but the fact is Gerrard\u2019s Rangers played a part in that with their relentlessness.\nSuccessive runs to the last 16 of the Europa League were noteworthy. There is a debate to be had on whether Rangers should be aiming for that kind of territory as a minimum but the fact remains they had been light years away from it before Gerrard arrived. Rangers topped a group that included Benfica.\nThey had looked back to fine domestic fettle immediately before their manager\u2019s departure. Their lead at the top of the table is four points, with a League Cup semi-final a little over a week away. Earlier, there had been struggles, including an embarrassing Champions League qualifying defeat by the 10 men of Malm\u00f6. Given their margin of 2020-21 league leeway, there was no excuse not to be fully prepared for that tie. Instead, Rangers capitulated at home.\nGerrard\u2019s task was to ensure last season was not the exception, given Rangers had been a clear second best in Scotland in 2018-19 and 2019-20. When Rangers lost at home to Hamilton in March 2020, days after being bundled out of the Scottish Cup by Hearts, there was audible disquiet from the Rangers support relating to Gerrard\u2019s capabilities. As football duly shut down, Rangers performed the perfect reset.\nGerrard is streetwise. He conducts and carries himself as a former Liverpool and England captain \u2013 and Rangers manager \u2013 should. Early over-praise and over-criticism of players at Rangers was toned down. When the training ground was revamped \u2013 again at decent cost \u2013 it was Gerrard\u2019s way of raising standards. Yet would a manager with his CV, without the wow factor Gerrard had as a player, be appointed by a Premier League club? It is tricky to imagine that being the case.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d declared Gerrard to mass appreciation as he was hired by Rangers. Go he did. At the first reasonable opportunity. What happens next at Ibrox may reveal Gerrard\u2019s true value.",

        "content": "Fuel made from waste and synthetic \u2018e-fuels\u2019 could reduce emissions significantly but scaling up quickly will be an immense challenge\n Why it\u2019s so hard to electrify shipping and aviation \u2013 interactive\nA powder blue airplane flew from London to Glasgow in September to deliver on a promise. Airlines around the world have committed to decarbonizing the industry \u2013 the British Airways flight was meant to demonstrate a decade of progress toward that goal.\nSustainable aviation fuel (SAF), made partly from recycled cooking oil, along with more efficient engines, a sleeker design and improved air traffic management helped reduce the flight\u2019s carbon emissions by 62% compared with a similar trip in 2010, according to BA. The airline was able to bill the trip as \u201ccarbon neutral\u201d because it bought carbon credits to offset the remaining 38% of emissions.\nIn demonstrating how far aviation has come, the flight showed the industry is far from carbon free.\nCommercial aviation emitted 918m metric tons of carbon in 2019, about half of which came from frequent flyers. The industry makes up about 2.5% of annual global emissions, but that figure will grow. Passenger travel rose nearly 300% between 1990 and 2019 and the pre-pandemic increases in traffic outpaced emissions savings from improved aircraft and air traffic efficiencies. Emissions could triple in the next three decades, according to some predictions, if aviation returns to its pre-Covid growth trajectory.\nThe industry has been slow to decarbonize, in large part because fossil fuels continue to be by far the cheapest and easiest way to fuel planes. But there is movement. In October, the International Air Transport Association (Iata) committed to reach net zero emissions by 2050, following a slew of net zero commitments this year from large European and US airlines.\nTo meet these targets, they are relying heavily on sustainable aviation fuel. SAF is seen as something of a holy grail for decarbonization, especially as zero-emissions aircraft powered by hydrogen and electricity are a decade or more away from commercial operation.\nMade from non-fossil-fuel feedstocks including cooking oils and agricultural waste, SAF could cut carbon emissions as much as 80% compared with conventional jet fuel, according to Iata. Research has shown that the use of SAF can also reduce engine soot and contrails, which have an even greater warming effect on the planet than aviation\u2019s carbon emissions. And as a \u201cdrop-in\u201d fuel that can be blended with kerosene, SAF is compatible with existing aircraft fuel systems.\nDozens of aviation and energy companies \u2013 including Delta, American Airlines and BP \u2013 recently committed to replace 10% of global jet fuel with SAF by 2030.\nThe problem is it\u2019s expensive \u2013 up to eight times more than conventional jet fuel \u2013 and there\u2019s not that much of it. About 100m litres (22m gallons) of SAF will be produced in 2021, according to IATA, a fraction of the 449bn litres (119bn gallons) the group estimates will be required by 2050 to keep to net zero commitments. Environmental advocates also warn that if demand for SAF is met by using crops as feedstock it may lead to deforestation to clear land and could compete with food production.\nSome scientists are hoping to help SAF scale by exploring the potential of waste. Derek Vardon, a researcher at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in Colorado, investigates ways to make fuel from \u201cwet waste\u201d, including food scraps and municipal wastewater.\n\u201cDespite a lot of recent buzz around increasing SAF production, there\u2019s a limited amount of non-food fats, oils and greases to use,\u201d he said. By diverting food waste that was destined to decay in landfill, Vardon and his colleagues say they can create SAF with a carbon footprint up to 165% lower than conventional jet fuel. US wet waste has the potential to replace roughly 20% of the country\u2019s jet fuel consumption, according to a study co-authored by Vardon.\nAt the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Washington state, Corinne Drennan, manager of bioenergy technologies programs, researches the potential of SAF that\u2019s brewed from industrial waste gases.\n\u201cThese waste gases that have carbon in them can come from steel mill manufacturing, from refineries, from landfill gas, from lots of different places,\u201d she said. Carbon-rich gases are fermented into ethanol and converted into a hydrocarbon fuel. Various feedstocks might supply the market for SAF, she said, \u201cand as you aggregate [feedstocks], you begin to build impact.\u201d\nOne of the most hyped fuels for cutting emissions is synthetic fuel, also known as e-kerosene, e-fuel and power-to-liquid fuel. Made with carbon dioxide and hydrogen (produced from water using renewable energy), it can be used in existing fuel systems.\n\u201cThere is potentially an unlimited amount of renewable electricity to use for e-kerosene,\u201d said Andrew Murphy, director of aviation for Transport & Environment, a green campaign group based in Brussels. When created using renewable electricity and carbon capture, synthetic fuel is nearly carbon neutral.\nIn January, KLM flew a plane from Amsterdam to Madrid in what the company called the world\u2019s first flight powered by synthetic fuel. Synthetic fuel made up around 5% of the fuel; the rest was conventional jet fuel, but the company said it was a step towards more widespread adoption.\nThe German airline Lufthansa joined aviation and energy groups including Transport & Environment to write an open letter in July urging the EU to set ambitious goals for synthetic fuel production and has partnered with the transport company Kuehne+Nagel to buy 25,000 liters a year.\nYet synthetic fuel is very expensive compared with conventional jet fuel and remains exceptionally limited in supply \u2013 and is likely to stay that way for at least the next decade. To scale up would require policy support and huge investment in the expansion of green energy infrastructure to provide enough electricity and carbon.\nIncreasing the production of renewables like solar and wind power to supply synthetic fuel will be \u201cvery costly\u201d, said Brandon Graver, a senior researcher at the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT).\nA lack of supply continues to be the big challenge to scaling up SAF from all sources, said Graver. \u201cThere needs to be a lot more investment,\u201d he added. In the US, SAF production will take decades to scale, according to the Biden administration\u2019s plan. The White House has set a goal of supplying 35bn gallons of SAF by 2050 but the US now produces only about 4.5m gallons a year.\nEurope\u2019s shift to SAF is also likely to be a decades-long process. A recent report from the ICCT estimated that the bloc has the potential to produce 898m gallons of SAF by 2030 \u2013 5.5% of projected jet fuel demand. The EU is considering a proposal that would require fuel suppliers to blend at least 2% of SAF into conventional jet fuel by 2025, 5% by 2030, and 63% by 2050.\nBut while policymakers pin their hopes on alternative fuels, climate advocates question whether aviation has the tools to decarbonize within the narrow timeframe available.\n\u201cThey haven\u2019t got the technologies for a genuine path to decarbonization,\u201d said Cait Hewitt, policy director at the Aviation Environment Federation, a UK non-profit. Reducing aviation\u2019s carbon impact will require sweeping changes to the industry and aggressive efforts to keep airplanes on the tarmac, she said.\nWhile passengers are increasingly given the option of offsetting their flight emissions, a number of investigations have found offset schemes to have serious credibility problems. Flying less often is one of the most climate-conscious lifestyle choices a person can make, according to research from Lund University in Sweden. That\u2019s especially true for the 1% of the global population who produce 50% of aviation emissions.\nAbandoning air travel is a tough proposal to sell, particularly when many countries lack cheap, efficient and comprehensive rail networks. It\u2019s an \u201cescapist and unrealistic approach\u201d, said Kwasi Adjekum, a professor of aviation at the University of North Dakota. \u201cThe reality is that air transportation is an essential part of global commerce and [the] supply chain network for goods and passengers.\u201d\nBut as research increasingly suggests that growth in aviation is incompatible with emissions goals, a growing number of people have committed to staying grounded. Some are driven by guilt; many have been inspired by climate activist Greta Thunberg. The \u201cflight shame\u201d movement Thunberg helped inspire was credited as one reason for a 4% drop in commercial flights in Sweden.\nIt will take years to ramp up SAF production and even longer to develop zero-emissions aircraft, said Murphy from Transport & Environment: \u201cRight now, flying less is the most effective way to reduce aviation emissions.\u201d\n This article was amended on 12 November 2021 to clarify that 50% of aviation emissions are produced by 1% of the global population, not \u201c1% of flyers\u201d, as an earlier version said.",

Their sats [Oxygen saturation levels] were fluctuating between the upper 70s and low 80s. It took five minutes for the 999 call I made to be answered and then another 45 minutes for the ambulance to turn up. The situation is terrifying.\n\u201cSadly that wasn\u2019t an isolated experience. A few weeks later a patient came into the surgery with cardiac-sounding chest pain. When that happens generally the concern is that the patient may be having a heart attack. Again I was holding on the 999 line, waiting minutes for an answer. There was a wait of almost an hour before the paramedics arrived.\n\u201cIn this instance, there were other health professionals around who could help if needed and also access to equipment should the situation have suddenly deteriorated, such as oxygen and an automated defibrillator, in case someone ends up with low oxygen levels or in cardiac arrest. I won\u2019t speculate as to whether this particular patient could have died. But if a person has features of cardiac-sounding chest pain, there is the potential for deterioration and maybe cardiac arrest.\n\u201cMy overriding feeling during that hour-long wait was shock that again there was a wait for the 999 call to be answered and a delay for help to arrive. It was at this point that it occurred to me that maybe the delays were becoming more commonplace, rather than being a one-off occurrence.\n\u201cI think back to my experience with the unwell patient on the home visit. I had no access to oxygen, no defibrillator. I was watching, waiting. I recall adjusting the oxygen saturation probe. If this clinical scenario had been playing out in a hospital, with the patient displaying those vital signs, a crash call would have been put out for a patient in peri-arrest.\n\u201cIf this is frightening for a doctor, I can only imagine how helpless a non-medically trained friend or relative would feel and how frightening it must be for them.\n\u201cIncreasingly, there are stories about relatives calling for an ambulance because an elderly relative has fallen and broken their hip and ended up waiting as much as 12 hours for help to arrive. Aside from the indignity, and the pain that must be experienced, the complications of being on the floor for that long start to stack up: dehydration, pressure sores, pneumonia, hypothermia, the consequences of muscle breakdown on the kidneys.\n\u201cAlthough the initial injury may not be life-threatening, the consequences of being on the floor for so long can end up being catastrophic for an elderly person. I wonder how the prime minister or the health secretary would feel if they found themselves in a similar situation with a loved one?\n\u201cThe ambulance service are doing their absolute best in wretched circumstances, as is everyone who works in the NHS. How can you reconcile the emotional impact on paramedic teams that are increasingly finding themselves in situations where time has run out? Being held up outside A&Es, waiting to hand over, but unable to because there is nowhere for the patient to go.\n\u201cGiven that the system was cracking in the summer and by October every ambulance service was at the highest level of alert, I fear what is to come this winter.\u201d\nAs told to Denis Campbell. The GP asked to remain anonymous",

During their tour of the joys of Christmas, the pair encounter Radishford, and by the end of the ad, the changed banana is spreading his own positive goodwill. It ends with the narrator, actor Jim Broadbent, saying: \u201cThe moral of the story? The answer you\u2019ll find \u2026 for you to be happy, you need to be kind.\u201d\nAldi works with Neighbourly, which links businesses to charitable organisations in local communities, to donate its surplus food to local causes.\nRashford was awarded an MBE by the Duke of Cambridge this week for his campaign to support vulnerable children. The 24-year-old footballer was recognised for his efforts last summer to ensure no child in need went hungry, which resulted in the government changing policy over its free school meals vouchers during lockdown.\nHe said: \u201cAs a family, we relied on the local food bank to get our Christmas dinner. To this day, I remember queueing outside that building with mum, mum feeling embarrassed that she might be recognised \u2026 For many children in situations like mine growing up, there is very little expectation around this time of year; add the impact of the pandemic and the very least they deserve is a Christmas dinner.\u201d\nSharing the ad on his Twitter page, Rashford wrote: \u201cWell done @AldiUK. This is much bigger than a Christmas ad ( \u2026) might not be Oscar-worthy but glad I could play my part.\u201d\nAldi UK\u2019s marketing director, Sean McGinty, said: \u201cChristmas is a time for hope, and we\u2019re privileged to be working with Marcus, who is one of the most inspirational young people in the UK, having done so much in the past 18 months to help provide free school meals for children.\n\u201cAt the same time, it wouldn\u2019t be the festive season without Kevin the Carrot on our TV screens, and we\u2019re thrilled to be bringing him back for the sixth year for his many fans, in what we think is his best Yuletide performance yet.\u201d",

Police said the man was believed to have been at least 50, was 1.7 metres (5ft 7ins) tall and had \u201ccongenital malformations to his nose and mouth\u201d.\nHe had been wearing long dark trousers, a woollen jumper, a striped shirt and black tie. A bobbled woollen hat and dark green raincoat were found alongside the remains, as were some coins in the old Italian currency, lira, an Omega watch, a comb with its case and size 41 Pivetta shoes.\nThe discovery was made by an officer with Catania\u2019s finance police and his alpine rescue dog during a training exercise in the area.\n\u201cThe area is very isolated, we go there periodically to do our training,\u201d Lt Col Massimiliano Pacetto said. \u201cIt was thanks to the sniffer dog that the remains were found.\u201d\nPacetto compared the mystery \u2013 which the Italian press have nicknamed \u201cthe man of Etna\u201d \u2013 to something one might read in a book by the late Inspector Montalbano author, Andrea Camilleri.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never experienced anything of the kind,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the moment all theories are valid and nothing is being excluded.\u201d\nPacetto said the cave on Europe\u2019s tallest active volcano was extremely difficult to access, and whether the man entered it voluntarily or by force, he may not have been able to escape. According to initial investigations, it did not appear that the man had suffered a violent death.\nPolice have received several calls from the public since the discovery, including from the daughter of Mauro De Mauro, a 49-year-old investigative journalist who disappeared in Palermo in September 1970 and whose body has never been found. Franca De Mauro contacted police after reading that the remains had malformations to the mouth and nose, which her father had because of an injury sustained during the second world war.\nInvestigations into his disappearance followed several different leads, one being that De Mauro was kidnapped and killed by the Cosa Nostra mafia owing to him knowing the truth about the alleged assassination of ENI boss, Enrico Mattei.\n\u201cDe Mauro is one of the theories we are looking into, and also other people who are missing for reasons that might be linked to criminality,\u201d said Pacetto. \u201cBut I repeat, nothing at this stage is being excluded.\u201d",

I still want to be a ceramicist while also being an actor. A functional ceramicist. My grandmother was a sculptural ceramicist and she was very brilliant, but I\u2019d like to make plates and pots and mugs. I\u2019m a big fan of Ian Godfrey and I\u2019m very fortunate to have a couple of his pieces. Lucie Rie and Hans Coper I really like; Richard Batterham, very much.\nI\u2019m really into the work of Sara Flynn and also of Akiko Hirai, who\u2019s a really amazing Japanese ceramicist who makes moon jars: half-ceramic, half-porcelain, with sort of trunks coming out with them. They\u2019re extraordinary.\nMothering Sunday is about survivor\u2019s guilt. Is that a remote concept for lots of people these days? How did you tap into it? bumble1\nI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a remote concept; I imagine it\u2019s very real for many people in countries that are still suffering from war and famine. In terms of tapping into it, I suppose in the same way as anything else: you do a lot of reading.\nI don\u2019t know that the film necessarily is about survivor guilt. But in the time between the first and second world wars, I think, for young men who were left behind, there must have been a sense of this generation who were wiped out [in the first world war]. What that did to the male psyche \u2013 and the national psyche \u2026\nDid you find returning to intimate work such as Romeo & Juliet difficult after the pandemic? Alexxe\nEveryone is wearing masks and you take them off just before you do your scene and you\u2019re tested all the time and keep apart from each other. For a lot of the crew, who have to carry extremely heavy equipment and do extremely hard work, doing that with a mask on is probably quite frustrating and difficult.\nBut apart from that it\u2019s pretty much just the same as filming normally: very fun and there\u2019s lots of nice people. We all just felt so lucky to have been working at that point. There wasn\u2019t an awful lot going on. Everyone was just very happy to be there and getting paid and doing their job.\nYou feature in Mothering Sunday alongside Olivia Colman [with whom he co-starred in The Crown]. What have you learned from her? And from Bill Nighy [with whom O\u2019Connor worked on Hope Gap and Emma]? bumble1\nLoads. I feel like I\u2019ve learned more about Olivia as a kind-hearted friend than anything else. She\u2019s an extraordinary actor and whenever I get to do anything with her I\u2019m just like a sponge. I still don\u2019t really understand how she does it. But how she is as a person is even more spectacular. And I learned most from that, I think.\nI would say the same thing about Bill. He\u2019s one of the greatest people I know and he is a very loyal friend and has a great mind. He\u2019s obviously a terrific actor and I learned lots from him, but he\u2019s similar to Olivia in the sense that some of the most brilliant lessons I\u2019ve learned in life have been from seeing how he goes about in the business.\nWhat advice would you give to your 21-year-old self? RubyMatthews32\nMy advice would probably be: find a therapist. I\u2019m a great believer that therapy is the best thing you can do as an act of kindness to yourself. It\u2019s just such a brilliant investigation into your psyche and your health. Therapy is just great work, a great way of accessing an understanding of brains and all personalities and all history. I just feel like it\u2019s one of the greatest things I\u2019ve ever done.\nWho are your dream collaborators? Sanktiasha\nThere are so many. I\u2019d love to work with my very great friend Francis Lee [the director of God\u2019s Own Country] again. Alice Rohrwacher. Luca Guadagnino. Christopher Nolan. Noah Baumbach. Jane Campion.\nDo you watch your own films or TV shows? Angymorton\nI never used to, only because I would see myself and be horrified and I wouldn\u2019t be able to judge the work in a reasonable manner at all. All I\u2019d see were the problems and the insecurities. But I\u2019ve got better at it and I think it\u2019s really important to be able to celebrate your friends and your colleagues. So I do watch stuff now, but I will never really watch it more than once. And I will kind of squint when I\u2019m on screen.\nI noticed that you\u2019re a bit of a dandy at premieres and events. Do you have any style heroes? MartGray\nTilda Swinton is very stylish. So maybe her. When I was younger, I would basically search for people like Bob Dylan or Pete Doherty and see what they were wearing. I was so mainstream; I would open up a music magazine and just copy what everyone else was wearing.\nNow, I just think it\u2019s quite fun dressing up. Normally, I\u2019m quite relaxed and chilled, but there is something kind of theatrical about red carpets. There\u2019s an aspect of having to play a role. You don\u2019t really want to give too much of yourself, but you are on show and it is part of your job. So putting on a mask or a costume is quite helpful to slightly remove yourself from things.\nWhat\u2019s something odd, interesting or unexpected you can tell us about Cheltenham and growing up there? EditorialJoe\nThere\u2019s a cheese-rolling competition held every year on Cooper\u2019s Hill, which is in Cheltenham, though people from Gloucester will argue it\u2019s in Gloucestershire. A big wheel of cheese is rolled down this steep hill \u2013 and when I say steep, it\u2019s so steep that people get very badly injured. People launch themselves off the hill after it and whoever gets down first wins the cheese.\nIt\u2019s so quirky and ridiculous and English. I know there was a time when it was illegal and I think people still did it anyway. When I was a kid, I thought: I\u2019d love to do that, because it must just feel like rolling down a hill. But then I went to it once and there\u2019s no chance. It is so terrifying. People who take it seriously end up with broken arms, ribs, shoulders. The less hardcore people will go down on their bums and even they get into trouble. It\u2019s so dangerous, but I absolutely love it and it\u2019s something I\u2019m very proud of.\nWhat film have you seen recently that moved you or affected you in some way? If not a film, then anything at all. Sanktiasha\nI was very lucky to see a film that\u2019s not come out yet called Lamb, which has Noomi Rapace in it. I found it hilarious, tragic and scary, all in one film, which is pretty miraculous.\nI read a lot of gardening books. I was reading something recently about growing things that are specifically localised, about planting things that are relevant to and will grow in your area, as opposed to going into the garden centre, buying some plants and sticking them in your soil. It\u2019s more about the origins of seeds and stuff like that.\nDo plants move me? Yeah. A hundred per cent. I find trees incredibly moving. This time of year is the best time to go to the Westonbirt arboretum, quite near Cheltenham. The colours are just extraordinary; I find that an extremely emotional place. There\u2019s also a tree in Cheltenham that is my favourite. I would say to my mum and dad: \u201cThat\u2019s my tree. It\u2019s the most important tree to me and only me. I\u2019m the only one that finds it important.\u201d\nAnd then, about three years ago, I went back to visit my family and we went on the same walk to the top of this hill, where the tree is very windswept and bent over \u2013 it looks like its hair is blowing out. It\u2019s kind of sculptural. And they\u2019d built a bench around it with about 500 plaques for people who have their ashes spread beneath. So it turns out it was everyone\u2019s tree.\nMy favourite trees are rowans, because of the beautiful, bright-red berries, and monkey puzzles. I actually don\u2019t like them to look at very much, but they seem sort of sturdy and grounded, but also quite scraggly. I identify with that. I think sometimes I feel quite grounded, but inside the wind is blowing me and I\u2019m sort of wobbling.\n Mothering Sunday is released on 12 November",

The two previous resolutions were passed under Mao Zedong, who led the Communists to power in 1949, and Deng Xiaoping, whose reforms in the 1980s turned China into an economic powerhouse.\nThe official summary of the resolution from the meeting said that under Xi\u2019s leadership, China had \u201cmade historic achievements and undergone a historic transformation\u201d. It praised Xi, Mao and Deng for leading the country to achieve \u201cthe tremendous transformation from standing up and growing prosperous to becoming strong\u201d.\nAnalysts said the resolution was designed to elevate Xi\u2019s status to the level of Mao and Deng and to help secure his political future, after the party removed presidential term limits in 2018.\n\u201cThe party central committee called on the entire party, the entire army and people of all ethnic groups to unite more closely around the party central committee with comrade Xi Jinping as the core, to fully implement Xi Jinping\u2019s new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics,\u201d said a Xinhua readout of the meeting.\nThe official summary \u2013 or communique \u2013 of the meeting said: \u201cEstablishing comrade Xi Jinping\u2019s position as the core of the central committee as well as of the whole party \u2026 was of decisive significance in advancing toward the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.\u201d\nThe summary also said that the party central committee finished \u201cmany major tasks that weren\u2019t finished before and promoted historic achievements and historic changes in the cause of the party and the country\u201d.\nThe resolution was passed after a major shift of power dynamics at the top of the CCP in recent years, and was aimed at convincing party officials as well as the wider population about the progress made under Xi\u2019s leadership, said Ling Li, an expert who studies the CCP at the University of Vienna\n\u201cThe resolution serves two purposes: first, it justifies the path to power of the winner of the power struggles by passing verdicts to those who lost; and second, it builds a case about the distinctive performance of the party under the winner,\u201d she said.\nYu Jie, a senior fellow on China at the London-based thinktank Chatham House, said Xi was not taking all the glory. \u201cInstead, he admitted and recognised the foundation established by his predecessors in different periods,\u201d Yu said.\nWhen term limits were removed, Chinese officials and experts said Xi might need more time to implement his agenda. \u201cDon\u2019t change pilot right after takeoff \u2026 [He] can reduce uncertainty for China, as the country enters a decisive period of development. I see no problem with that,\u201d said one high-profile state broadcaster.\nXi faces no obvious rivals, but critics say an attempt to stay in power has the potential to alienate younger party figures, who might see their chances for promotion diminished.\nPolitical scientists also point to the experience of other countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America, where long periods of one-person rule have resulted in a worsening of decision-making and poor economic performance.\nAs well as confirming Xi\u2019s strongman status and demonstrating the party\u2019s supremacy, the document also told party members to \u201cbe absolutely certain that we make no disruptive mistakes on fundamental issues\u201d.\nThose fundamental issues included party legitimacy, economic reform and opening up, and territorial integrity, said Yu. \u201cIt implies that China will only charter a path led by the party,\u201d she said.\nThe resolution comes as Beijing\u2019s relationship with many western capitals is deteriorating over issues including the situations in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Xinjiang.\nThe communique said the world was undergoing \u201cgreat changes unseen in a century\u201d, intertwined with the Covid pandemic. It admitted that, internally, China was facing an \u201cextremely arduous task\u201d in controlling Covid and developing its economy and society.\nAssociated Press and Agence France-Presse contributed to this report",

It allows either side to take steps, or \u201csafeguards\u201d in treaty-speak, if the protocol leads to \u201cserious economic, societal or environmental difficulties that are liable to persist, or to diversion of trade\u201d.\nThe party triggering it must prove that the protocol has given rise to \u201cserious economic, societal or environmental\u201d difficulties. The \"safeguards\" have not been legally defined but they must be \u201cappropriate\u201d to the damage caused and are likely to include the semi-permanent suspension of checks on goods flowing from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.\nThe invoking of article 16 would not immediately have a huge impact on the ground. This is because many of the checks have already been unilaterally suspended by the UK and the article 16 process itself triggers a formal dispute process that requires both sides to go into talks to resolve the dispute.\nLisa O'Carroll\u00a0Brexit correspondent\n\u201cWe think that the objectives set out by the UK are unattainable,\u201d said a senior EU official. \u201cThe UK position is that the role of the EU\u2019s institution needs to go \u2026 As long as that remains the UK position, I don\u2019t see what we can do.\u201d\nThe talks over the post-Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland are in their fourth week. A protocol in the withdrawal agreement Johnson signed keeps Northern Ireland in the single market and draws a customs border down the Irish Sea in order to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.\nIn October, the EU offered to drastically reduce the number of checks on goods coming from Great Britain to Northern Ireland in recognition of the political and economic disruption being caused. But the UK is insisting that the protocol needs a more fundamental redrafting including the removal of the European court of justice from its role as arbiter of EU law.\nBrussels has countered that Northern Ireland cannot maintain single market access without the ECJ remaining as the chief arbiter of EU law.\n\u201cThe UK wants us to engage in intensive talks and we are happy to do so,\u201d an EU official said before Friday\u2019s meeting. \u201cBut then the UK must take a step towards us to ensure that the talks are meaningful. If the UK wants these discussions to succeed, then the major step that we took on 13 October needs to be reciprocated. On questions around governance and the court of justice we have always made clear that we think that the objectives set out by the UK are unattainable.\u201d\nBrussels believes the UK is being too dogmatic in its approach, raising concerns about the sincerity of the prime minister\u2019s desire to find a solution.\nEU officials point to attempts to answer concerns over the collection of VAT in Northern Ireland. Downing Street has complained that evolution in the EU law book that applies in Northern Ireland could put traders there at a disadvantage compared with those based in the rest of the UK.\nAn EU official said: \u201cThere is a specific provision in the protocol, which gives a role to the joint committee for finding solutions where the application of VAT principles under the protocol creates issues in Northern Ireland. It\u2019s one of the sub-paragraphs of article eight.\n\u201cOn that point, for example, we say why don\u2019t we use the mechanisms specifically provided for in the protocol to see how far we can go. And yet the UK having never tried that calls for a radically different approach to VAT which would require a renegotiation of the protocol.\u201d\nFrance\u2019s EU affairs minister, Cl\u00e9ment Beaune, suggested Northern Ireland had been benefiting from its access to both the EU and single market, describing Brexit as \u201ca failure\u201d instead for the rest of the UK.\nHe said on Thursday: \u201cBrexit is a failure, it\u2019s clear \u2026 Brexit has an impact on the British economy more negative than Covid, it\u2019s written black and white.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen the shortages taking place in Great Britain, the problems in Northern Ireland are better because they have access to the European market.\u201d\nSpeaking in the House of Lords on Wednesday, Frost urged the EU to \u201ckeep calm\u201d. \u201cIn my view, this process of negotiations has not reached its end,\u201d he said. \u201cAlthough we have been talking for nearly four weeks, there remain possibilities that the talks have not yet seriously examined, including many approaches that have been suggested by the UK.\u201d\nThe Labour party called on Johnson to reach a deal with the EU over the Northern Ireland protocol and end the \u201cpoison of division\u201d it says the government has provoked.\nThe shadow Northern Ireland secretary, Louise Haigh, said the Conservative party had been \u201creckless\u201d in its approach to Northern Ireland, where a fragile peace has held for more than 20 years.\nIn a speech to the Senator George J Mitchell Institute for Peace in Belfast, she urged the prime minister not to provoke \u201cfurther poisonous instability\u201d in the weeks ahead.\nHaigh said: \u201cThe Conservatives\u2019 reckless custody of the Good Friday agreement has sown division and undermined stability. This is not a partisan point, nor one that gives me any satisfaction. Peace in Northern Ireland is too precious to be a plaything of partisan politics.\n\u201cThe Labour party recognises and pays tribute to the work done by John Major, who helped lay the ground for the Good Friday agreement. But we cannot ignore the damage that has been done.\u201d",

But I wanted to do it in less than a minute,\u201d the 105 year-old said after the race, where she recorded a time of 1:02.95, a record for women in the 105+ age category.

The home of Mickey Mouse and Princess Elsa has revealed it is planning to join the likes of Mark Zuckerberg and Microsoft in the metaverse.\nThe new tech concept, a blending of the physical and digital worlds where people can interact virtually, is becoming a multibillion-dollar fixation for Silicon Valley executives, including the Facebook founder who is staking his company\u2019s future on its success.\nAnd now Hollywood is taking note too, according to the Disney chief executive, Bob Chapek, who said on Wednesday the company was preparing to take the leap into virtual reality.\nReferring to Disney\u2019s history of innovation in storytelling, which includes the Mickey Mouse cartoon Steamboat Willie, one of the first to feature synchronised sound, Chapek said: \u201cThe Walt Disney Company has a long track record as an early adopter in the use of technology to enhance the entertainment experience.\u201d\nDisney\u2019s former executive vice-president of digital, Tilak Mandadi, wrote a LinkedIn post in 2020 about creating a theme park metaverse, where the \u201cphysical and digital world converge\u201d through wearable devices and mobile phones.\nThe metaverse concept also includes augmented reality, where elements of the digital world are layered on top of reality, such as the Pok\u00e9mon Go game, which is played on mobile phones or Facebook\u2019s recent smart glasses tie-up with Ray-Ban.\nSpeaking during the company\u2019s quarterly corporate results call, Chapek added: \u201cOur efforts to date are merely a prologue to a time when we\u2019ll be able to connect the physical and digital worlds even more closely, allowing for storytelling without boundaries in our own Disney metaverse.\u201d\nChapek gave no specific details of Disney\u2019s plans on the results call, in keeping with a concept that is still very much in its early stages across the tech industry. But he indicated in a further interview on CNBC on Wednesday that the company\u2019s Disney+ streaming service would be involved. In the interview, Chapek said he saw it as an extension of Disney+, through the \u201cthree-dimensional canvas\u201d he envisions for new types of storytelling, which could involve a cast of characters that ranges from Mickey Mouse to Snow White, Iron Man and Luke Skywalker.\nDisney+, which has 118 million subscribers to Netflix\u2019s 214 million, has already launched a number of hit franchise spin-offs such as Star Wars adventure The Mandalorian and the Avengers series Wandavision. However, that subscriber total represented a shortfall on market expectations, with analysts anticipating Disney+ would reach 125 million users in its latest results. Netflix has also reported slowing subscriber growth as the relaxation of lockdown measures renews the appeal of out-of-home entertainment \u2013 and forces executives to consider new ways of boosting sign-ups.\nHowever, some of Disney\u2019s digital ventures have struggled. Its online children\u2019s social network, Club Penguin, was closed in 2017 a decade after its launch. Its $563m (\u00a3420m) purchase of Playdom in 2010, which marked the company\u2019s entry into social gaming, had its value written down. Disney also struggled with Maker Studios, a YouTube network it bought for $500m in 2014.\nMark Zuckerberg has been the most prominent exponent of the metaverse. His notion of the concept, revealed last month in a presentation where he announced the rebranding of Facebook\u2019s corporate name to Meta, is of avatars \u2013 or digital representations of people \u2013 meeting in the virtual realm by donning VR headsets (Meta owns the Oculus VR headset business). His executives, including PR chief Nick Clegg and product boss Chris Cox, now take their weekly team meetings in the metaverse, via the company\u2019s Horizon Workrooms product. But the company has made clear that a fully fledged virtual world, where friends can meet to try on clothes or attend pop concerts, is a decade or more away.\nMicrosoft is introducing a metaverse for office workers via its Teams product, whose services include hosting video meetings. In the first half of next year Teams users will be able to appear as avatars in online meetings \u2013 appearing as a cartoon in their bit of the screen if they so wish. Teams is used by 250 million people once a month, which gives Microsoft an influential role in shaping the corporate metaverse.\nThe metaverse is here, and it\u2019s not only transforming how we see the world but how we participate in it \u2013 from the factory floor to the meeting room. Take a look. pic.twitter.com/h5tsdYMXRD\nGame-makers Roblox and Epic, the producer of Fortnite, are also working on their own metaverses and Zuckerberg envisages the metaverse as an array of virtual worlds that are meshed together, with people\u2019s individual avatars wandering between them.",

She died in my place as far as I was concerned...\n\u201cI still have very bad dreams. I see Yvonne every day, I know she\u2019s with me here \u2013 I know that. She was one of my best friends and I let her down. I still feel responsible for what did happen to her.\u201d\nMurray said Fletcher, who was 25, was about three yards away from him when he heard what he thought was a firework before turning to see his stricken colleague on the ground. He said as he cradled her head in his hands he promised he would bring her assassin to justice.\nRecalling having to formally identify her at the hospital and staying for the postmortem, Murray said: \u201cI can remember she was lying in the mortuary \u2013 cold, naked, frightened. I couldn\u2019t do anything to help her. It was too late, I wanted to do something but I couldn\u2019t.\u201d\nHe said he had to get the tube home from hospital and never received any treatment for the trauma he suffered.\nMurray told the court he sent hundreds of letters to the prime minister, home secretary and Metropolitan police commissioner asking about the investigation into Fletcher\u2019s killer but got no response.\nHe said that when Tony Blair went to see Gaddafi in 2004, Murray was told in advance that Fletcher would be \u201ctop of the agenda\u201d and even asked to accompany the prime minister but was met with a refusal.\nMurray said he was \u201cdisgusted\u201d to find out \u201cit wasn\u2019t discussed. The purpose of the meeting in the desert in the tent with Gaddafi was for business deals, oil deals, construction deals, nothing to do with Yvonne\u201d. Blair later told MPs that Fletcher was \u201cpart of the conversation\u201d.\nMurray said his hopes were raised when Mabrouk was arrested by Scotland Yard in 2015 only to be dashed two years later when detectives said they were dropping the investigation because key evidence could not be used in court for reasons of national security. Explaining his current claim against Mabrouk for assault and battery, Murray said: \u201cIf he authorities were not going to take any action, then the only option was for me [to do so].\u201d\nMabrouk is not accused of firing the shots that killed Fletcher but of being a \u201ckey participant\u201d in the decision to use violence. He has denied any involvement but is not participating in the trial, which is expected to conclude on Friday.",

That shortage has pushed up the prices of used cars, which are 36% higher in Australia than before the pandemic began.\nAustralia\u2019s international borders have reopened, while some state borders are still in place. But with many Australians still reluctant to leave these shores \u2013 whether out of fear of Covid or because of the complications it brings \u2013 Tourism Australia is continuing its Holiday Here This Year campaign to support domestic tourism.\nBut those without wheels, and those wanting to fly and hire some, can expect to pay more than $1,000 a week.\nRentals are most expensive in Tasmania, where prices have reached $169 a day \u2013 that\u2019s $1,183 a week, assuming no discounts. No state has an average price of less than $100 a day.\nKayak, the travel search engine, collected the data for car rental searches between 1 December this year and 31 January 2022.\nThe number of people searching for rental cars more than doubled in most states compared to last year, and as demand increased so did prices. In the Northern Territory, Queensland and Tasmania, prices have more than doubled since 2019.\nFederal Chamber of Automotive Industries\u2019 (FCAI) public affairs manager, Doug Wylie, said automotive shortages aren\u2019t caused by the shipping logjam that has affected other products including building materials, or the pallet shortage that is slowing the distribution of groceries.\n\u201cIt is primarily due to the global shortage of semiconductors and the flow-on impacts to vehicle manufacturing,\u201d he said. \u201cThe issue with the semiconductor chips varies across car brands, and is a problem for the manufacturing sector in general. Carmakers are dealing with it, as are whitegoods manufacturers.\u201d\nChip manufacturers slowed down production as lockdowns began, and were unprepared when demand for chips soared as people bought electronic goods to keep them entertained or to work from home.\nA storm and a fire in separate manufacturing facilities compounded the problem.\nIt takes time and money to establish new factories, Wylie said, so there will be car shortages until next year.\n\u201cThe rental market in many respects is a snapshot of the car market. You have luxury models, hatchbacks and family cars,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe shortage varies across brands and models greatly.\u201d\n\u201c[When buying a new car] there are some cars you can purchase off the lot today, some you\u2019ll purchase and they\u2019ll be delivered in a week, some can take months.\u201d\nFCAI\u2019s data shows car rental companies are trying to make up for the shortfall. They have bought almost 891,000 cars so far this year, compared with just over 726,000 at the same time last year.\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\n\u201cConsumers in general need to be doing their research on what models are available here and now. They need to be prepared for possible wait times on some models, especially if they\u2019re looking for particular specs, colours, and trims,\u201d Wylie said.\n\u201cDespite the apparent shortage, we have about 86 brands operating in Australia. With this level of competition consumers can still get a good deal within reasonable timeframes.\u201d\nThe Kayak data shows the last week in January is the cheapest in the holiday period to rent a car (the average price is $92 a day), while the week from 27 December to 2 January is the most expensive, with an average price of $157.",

        "content": "Frederik Willem \u2013 FW \u2013 de Klerk, who has died aged 85, was the last president of South Africa under apartheid. He was often compared with Mikhail Gorbachev, the last leader of the Soviet Union, for his work in consigning a bankrupt and reviled regime to oblivion.\nWhen De Klerk succeeded PW Botha in 1989, he oversaw an event no less unexpected than the collapse of Soviet communism was when Gorbachev came to power in 1985. His stunning act of realpolitik in announcing sweeping political reform, including the release of his eventual successor, Nelson Mandela, was the grand gesture that saved his country, and in 1993 they shared the Nobel peace prize. The following year Mandela became the country\u2019s first democratically elected leader.\nFears of uncontrollable bloodshed and civil war had proved unfounded as De Klerk led a skilful, strategic withdrawal by the white, Afrikaans-speaking inventors of apartheid, the National party, in power since 1948. Very few observers of De Klerk\u2019s presidential term expected to see the end of apartheid in their lifetimes. Almost nobody, not even his NP colleagues, appreciated that there was more to this machine politician than affability and adroitness in debate.\nAnglophones as well as Afrikaners wanted him to preserve white supremacy, while the black African majority wanted, but could hardly have expected, him to run up a white flag. South Africa got a radical pragmatist with a talent for negotiation who set about the tortuous preparation for an orderly transfer of power. Foreigners made the same mistake about De Klerk as they had about his two predecessors, Botha and John Vorster: because he, too, spoke English like a steamroller he could only be dimwitted. But it was simply not his mother tongue.\nBorn in Johannesburg, FW was the son of Hendrina (nee Coetzer) and Jan (Johannes) de Klerk, a teacher. His father was also Transvaal general secretary of the NP and a member of the province\u2019s parliament and cabinet, until appointed to the senate, the upper house of the old white central parliament in Cape Town, as national minister of labour and public works.\nThe young De Klerk was thus steeped in Afrikaner politics from childhood. Already an NP activist, he left Monument high school in Krugersdorp to study law at Potchefstroom University, graduating in 1958.\nHe became a qualified attorney in private practice at Vereeniging, Transvaal (now Gauteng), in 1961, and a decade later was chosen at short notice as parliamentary candidate for Vereeniging, and elected in November 1972. After hard work on committees he became the NP information officer for Transvaal, the constitutionally federal party\u2019s dominant province. When in 1978 Botha succeeded Vorster he promoted De Klerk to the cabinet, where he held six posts in succession over 11 years.\nBut his key appointment was not in Botha\u2019s gift: he was elected Transvaal leader of the NP in 1982. Botha was an anomaly, having risen to supreme office via the Cape provincial leadership largely because Vorster, disgraced over the \u201cMuldergate\u201d secret slush-fund scandal, had been a Transvaaler.\nThis promotion made the less than colourful De Klerk the heir apparent to Botha as the next \u201cchief leader\u201d of the NP and state president, into which office the premiership was absorbed under Botha\u2019s constitutional changes, which came into effect in 1984.\nMeanwhile Botha was ineptly seeking to break out of South Africa\u2019s increasing isolation. But when US banks, prompted by superbly organised African-American lobbying, halted investment in South Africa and started a stampede, apartheid\u2019s number was up. While Margaret Thatcher railed against sanctions as \u201cimmoral\u201d and Ronald Reagan\u2019s US administration secretly backed South Africa\u2019s disastrous intervention in the Angolan civil war, sanctions finally worked. The currency shrivelled, the economy reeled and internal unrest mounted, provoking a prolonged and bloody state of emergency throughout the late 1980s.\nThe bellicose Botha was not the man to achieve a fair settlement with the turbulent black majority. The best he could manage in his constitutional changes of 1984 was to give \u201ccoloured\u201d (mixed-race) and ethnic-Indian minorities separate chambers in parliament, while the black majority were left to exercise their \u201crights\u201d through tribal homelands that occupied just 13% of South Africa\u2019s worst land, and in which millions of them did not even live. De Klerk assisted in this last realignment of partitions until apartheid was fatally holed by an economic iceberg.\nThe crash came in 1989. A fissure had opened in the NP, with the diehards defecting to the Conservative party, founded in 1982. Botha resigned as NP leader in January 1989 after a stroke. De Klerk was elected leader in his place, but Botha clung to the presidency \u2013 only to resign in a huff that August when De Klerk dared to go to Zambia for talks with President Kenneth Kaunda without his permission. De Klerk was appointed head of state and government in September by an electoral college formed from the three racial chambers of parliament.\nHe began to unravel apartheid by organising the repeal of one racist law after another, reining in the rampant security apparatus built up by Vorster and Botha and finally, in February 1990, releasing Nelson Mandela. The magic of his name had survived 26 years in jail and even the Botha regime had been driven into secret, though abortive, contacts with him. De Klerk realised that no settlement could be achieved unless he was freed, and years of fraught negotiation between the NP and the African National Congress ensued, leading to the first election by universal franchise in 1994.\nMandela was duly sworn in as the country\u2019s first black president, while De Klerk became vice-president in the transitional government. He would have been well advised to bow out gracefully at once, with the Nobel peace prize shared with his successor, when the worldwide esteem he had earned by his statesmanship was at its height.\nBut, booed by leftwingers at the Oslo prize ceremony and blasted by white rightwingers at home, De Klerk soldiered on from 1994 to 1996 as Mandela\u2019s increasingly embittered deputy. The two men exchanged insults in public, belying the handshakes and fine words at the handover.\nDe Klerk resigned as NP leader and left politics in 1997 to write his memoirs. He had already withdrawn the NP from the government of national unity in 1996, sidelining it after 48 years in power. The rump was reconstituted as the New NP, and De Klerk left it in 2004 when it merged with the ANC.\nAs the remarkable work of Archbishop Desmond Tutu\u2019s Truth and Reconciliation Commission continued meanwhile, the horrific measures taken by successive NP leaders to preserve white domination were exposed \u2013 clearly enough to lead to the inescapable conclusion that De Klerk, as a cabinet minister, must have been aware of them, even though Botha made the big decisions.\nDe Klerk\u2019s memoirs, The Last Trek: A New Beginning (1999) were a classic politician\u2019s apologia, rejecting blame for the actions of the security forces, which he had been obliged to appease even as he negotiated power away. By then he had instituted the De Klerk Foundation, to \u201cwork for peace in multicommunity societies\u201d.\nIn 1969 he married Marike Willemse, and they had three children, Susan, Jan and Willem. After their divorce in 1998, De Klerk married Elita Georgiades. Marike was killed during a robbery in 2001; Willem died in 2020. De Klerk is survived by Elita, Susan and Jan.\nCoupling the names of De Klerk and Mandela, as the Nobel committee did, may seem like placing a garden gnome alongside a Michelangelo statue. Yet the peaceful triumph of the latter would not have been possible without the pragmatic statesmanship of the former, however grudging. White diehards condemned De Klerk as a Judas. The analogy is totally false.\nDe Klerk may have been driven by historic necessity, but unlike his predecessors he recognised it, and displayed moral courage in acting on it, saving untold South African lives in the process.\n Frederik Willem de Klerk, politician, born 18 March 1936; died 11 November 2021\n Dan van der Vat died in 2019",

        "content": "Azeem Rafiq has described himself as \u201cincredibly hurt\u201d after Joe Root said he has not been witness to any instances of racism during his 14 years at Yorkshire.\nOn Thursday England\u2019s Test captain broke his silence on the continuing scandal hours before Mark Arthur confirmed his resignation as chief executive. Issuing a statement from his team\u2019s pre-Ashes quarantine camp in Queensland, Root described racism as \u201cintolerable\u201d and called for change in the sport. However, in a follow-up press conference \u2013 one in which questions on specific allegations were barred \u2013 Root was asked three times whether he could remember any of the abuse that Rafiq has alleged was widespread during his two spells in the Yorkshire dressing room between 2008 and 2018. \u201cNot that I can recall, no I can\u2019t,\u201d he replied.\nRoot did add that \u201cit is clear things happened\u201d which need eradicating and he has pledged to help Lord Patel, the new Yorkshire chair, who has hailed Rafiq as a whistleblower and is now tackling the gravest crisis in the club\u2019s 158-year history.\nBut Rafiq is understood to still feel badly let down by Root failing to acknowledge he was witness to any wrongdoing personally and, an hour after his former teammate had spoken, tweeted: \u201cDisappointed is not even the feeling. Incredibly Hurt. But uncomfortable truths are hard to accept it seems.\u201d\nThis was followed by news that Arthur, the Yorkshire chief executive, has become the latest person to leave Headingley in the wake of the scandal. Patel said the departure was \u201can important moment for the club\u201d and added that new leadership \u201cwill be vital in driving the change we urgently need\u201d.\nArthur, who was at the helm when Rafiq\u2019s original allegations of racism were not properly escalated when he left the club in 2018, thanked supporters and listed the six-year south Asian engagement programme and the redevelopment of the Bradford Park Avenue ground as being among the highlights of his eight-year spell in charge.\nThe day was dominated by Root and Rafiq, however, two players who rose through the academy ranks together and made first-class debuts in 2009 before their careers went in different directions. They were also close friends with Gary Ballance, the former England batsman who last week admitted using racist language towards Rafiq in the past as part of what he described as their \u201ctwo-way\u201d friendly verbals.\nAs a centrally contracted England player, Root\u2019s time at Headingley has been limited since his debut in 2012. The 30-year-old has also driven the Test team\u2019s public messaging on anti-discrimination and earned praise in 2019 after challenging an alleged homophobic slur by West Indies\u2019 Shannon Gabiel on the field of play.\nRafiq has previously described Root as an \u201coutstanding guy\u201d in interviews \u2013 similar praise has gone to Jason Gillespie, Yorkshire head coach from 2012 to 2016 \u2013 but has been left flummoxed by his old teammate replying \u201cno\u201d when asked whether he recognised the dressing room environment that has been portrayed of late.\nAs such, Root now risks being publicly challenged on this point by Rafiq when the former off-spinner speaks under parliamentary privilege at what is expected to be an explosive session of the digital, culture, media and sport select committee on Tuesday.\nAsked if the events of the past 18 months have made him question his future at Yorkshire, Root replied: \u201cIf you\u2019re not at the club, how can you make any change? How can you help move things forward? As I said, I look forward to speaking to Lord Patel at some point in the future about how I can help move things forward.\u201d\nOn the subject of whether players found to have used racist language should be banished from the sport, Root replied: \u201cI do think people deserve a second chance. And if they are willing to accept that they\u2019ve made a mistake and they want to make change and want to move forward then I think that\u2019s really important as well.\u201d\nIn his earlier statement, Root said: \u201cThese events have fractured our game and torn lives apart. We must now recover and come back together as fans, players, media and those who work within cricket. We have an opportunity to make the sport I love better for everyone.\n\u201cI want to see change and actions that will see YCCC rise from this with a culture that harnesses a diverse environment with trust across all communities that support cricket in the county. We need to educate, unify and reset.\u201d\nMuch of the fallout is a direct result of Yorkshire\u2019s handling of the crisis, first by failing to escalate Rafiq\u2019s allegations when he raised them, in-house, in 2018 and then the 12-month investigation that Patel described as \u201cflawed\u201d upon announcing that the club had settled the employment tribunal case with their former off-spinner.\nIndeed Rafiq himself tweeted on Thursday that he tried hard to prevent the current \u201ccar crash\u201d at Yorkshire, something that has already led to Andrew Gale being suspended as head coach pending an investigation into an antisemitic tweet posted 11 years ago and Martyn Moxon, the director of cricket, being signed off with stress.\nRafiq insists this is the result of the club being unwilling to listen to him and clearly there are those at Headingley who still vehemently reject his allegations. This was outlined in a letter from 14 staff members to the club\u2019s board in October that spoke of a \u201cone-man mission to bring down the club\u201d.\nSent three weeks after Yorkshire published a summary of the report into Rafiq\u2019s allegations \u2013 one that concluded he was the victim of racial harassment \u2013 the signatories accused the club of failing to offer a strong rebuttal of his claims.\nThe letter, first reported by the Daily Telegraph, said: \u201cStaff who knew Azeem well felt that an initial apology to him and an acceptance that he was a victim was not the correct approach and misrepresented entirely what kind of individual he was whilst at the club.\n\u201cThere are endless episodes of Azeem\u2019s behaviour, well-known to the club, which reflect on him as a person well before he decided to accuse the club, staff and players of any wrongdoing. We find it difficult to comprehend how this part of Azeem\u2019s character has not been released or at least used by the club in its defence.\u201d\nResponding to publication of this letter, Patel said: \u201cIt is troubling for many reasons, and further evidence of the wider issues the club has faced.\u201d\nThe Yorkshire board\u2019s previous response to this \u2013 and the crisis as a whole \u2013 will need to be explained by Roger Hutton when he speaks to the select committee next week, with the former chair having bemoaned \u201ca culture that refuses to accept change or challenge\u201d upon resigning from his position last Friday. Tom Harrison, the ECB chief executive, will appear before the select committee too.",

        "content": "Lukashenko responds to possible sanctions as thousands of migrants camp in freezing temperatures at Poland borderWhy Belarus\u2019s pipeline threats could mean even higher gas prices\nAlexander Lukashenko has threatened to cut deliveries of gas to Europe via a major pipeline as the Belarusian leader promised to retaliate against any new EU sanctions imposed in response to the crisis at the Poland-Belarus border.\nBacked by the Kremlin, Lukashenko has struck a defiant note after inciting a migrant crisis at the border, where thousands of people, mainly from Middle Eastern countries, are camped out as temperatures plunge below freezing.\nMeanwhile thousands marched through the streets of Warsaw to mark Poland\u2019s Independence Day, including far-right groups calling for the government to prevent migrants from entering the country illegally. The city government had banned the march but those orders were overturned by the national government, which is dominated by the conservative Law and Justice party.\nPolish authorities have taken a hardline stance on the crisis, instituting a state of emergency in the border region that allows police to ignore asylum requests and summarily expel migrants. It also prevents NGOs and journalists from entering the border zone.\nAs punishment for Belarus\u2019 actions, the EU is expected to sanction up to 30 Belarusian individuals and entities, possibly including the national air carrier Belavia. Belarus\u2019s neighbours have said they may be forced to shut their borders.\n\u201cWe heat Europe, and they are still threatening us that they\u2019ll shut the borders,\u201d said Lukashenko in an emergency meeting with his top ministers on Thursday. \u201cAnd what if we cut off [the transit of] natural gas to them? So I would recommend that the leadership of Poland, Lithuanian and other brainless people to think before they speak.\u201d\nThe threat to cut off deliveries along the Yamal-Europe pipeline from Russia is an attempt to pile additional pressure on Europe, where gas prices spiked last month due to an international energy crisis.\nYet it appears unlikely that EU members will back down from a new round of sanctions against Lukashenko, who has already been targeted for a brutal crackdown on his country\u2019s opposition and the grounding of a Ryanair flight in May.\nBelarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya said Lukashenko would not follow through on the threat. \u201cIt would be more harmful for him, for Belarus, than for the European Union and I can suppose it\u2019s bluffing,\u201d Tikhanovskaya told AFP, urging European countries to hold firm and not communicate directly with the \u201cillegitimate\u201d leader.\nEU members say that Lukashenko has enabled thousands of people to travel through Minsk and to the EU borders as revenge for the sanctions against him. Belavia, the Belarusian state airline, has strongly denied it is involved in any trafficking of vulnerable people to the border with the EU.\nVideos posted to social media indicate that the flow of migrants through Minsk has not slowed and that hundreds more people may be arriving at the border every day.\nPoland reported that there had been 468 illegal attempts to cross the border on Wednesday and that people had attempted to cut through razor-wire or use logs to batter down border fencing in some places.\nOther countries bordering Belarus have warned that the border crisis could lead to a new military conflict. In a joint statement on Thursday, the defence ministers of Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia called the situation \u201cthe most complex security crisis for our region, Nato and the European Union in many years\u201d.\nBelarus\u2019 use of migrants could lead to \u201cprovocations and serious incidents that could also spill over into military domain,\u201d the statement said.\nIn a show of support for Lukashenko, Moscow has dispatched nuclear-capable bombers for the past two days to patrol the skies over western Belarus. The Russian defence ministry has called the patrols, which included imitation bombing runs by a pair of Tupolev Tu-160 heavy strategic bombers on Thursday, a training exercise of the countries\u2019 joint air defence systems.\n\u201cLet them squeak and shout,\u201d Lukashenko told his top officials in bellicose remarks. \u201cYes, these are bombers capable of carrying nuclear weapons. But we have no other option. We have to see what they are doing beyond the borders.\u201d\nLukashenko also claimed that there had been attempts to smuggle weapons from east Ukraine to those on the border in an attempt to \u201cprovoke our border guards into a conflict with theirs\u201d. He did not provide any evidence for the claim, which he said he had discussed with Vladimir Putin.\nUkraine\u2019s interior ministry on Thursday announced that it was planning to deploy an additional 8,500 troops and police officers, as well as 15 helicopters, to prevent attempts by people to cross the border. Although not part of the EU, the country has said it is also concerned at being drawn into the crisis.\nEuropean officials said that they expected the crisis to worsen. The German foreign minister, Heiko Maas, said that the picture from the border camps between Belarus and Poland were \u201cterrible\u201d. \u201cLukashenko is responsible for this suffering. He abuses people to put the EU under pressure.\u201d",

        "content": "A match blessed with so much drama it kept coming even after the final runs had been hit and the players had left the field, illuminated with several outstanding individual performances and a couple of unexpected plot twists, ended with Matthew Wade powering Australia to victory over Pakistan and a place in the T20 World Cup final against New Zealand on Sunday.\nIn the moments after their unexpected pursuit of the title had been terminally derailed, Pakistan announced that before passing a fitness test on the morning of the game their opener Mohammad Rizwan had spent two nights in hospital, some of it apparently in intensive care, with a chest infection, a development they had kept secret to protect team morale. Having declared himself fully recovered Rizwan proceeded to hit a 52-ball 67, remarkably assured in the circumstances, in which the only pain was that he inflicted on the Australians.\nBut Australia always thought a target of 177 was achievable on a good wicket and, having started their tournament by steering them to victory over South Africa, Marcus Stoinis and Wade came together to guide them the final. \u201cTo be able to bat with Marcus has been awesome,\u201d Wade said. \u201cI played a lot of cricket with him at Victoria, I\u2019ve seen him grow into the cricketer he is today, and I know if I can just hang with him for a few overs he\u2019s going to find a boundary.\n\u201cTrying to keep calm is probably the biggest thing in the back end and I get to look down the other end and see his big rig looking to hit it out of the park.\u201d\nOn this occasion it was Wade who did the more explosive hitting, with 41 off 17 balls including three successive sixes off Shaheen Shah Afridi to end the match. And so, 24 hours after England, the team that dominated Group One of the Super 12s, were knocked out of the competition, the side that dominated Group Two followed them. After an often underwhelming group stage and two high-quality, compelling semi-finals, it seems the tournament has saved its best until last, even if the best teams did not last.\nAustralia\u2019s run chase got off to a terrible start, with Shaheen bowling a magnificent opening over of high-speed extreme late in-swing, and Aaron Finch absolutely blameless as he fell to his first ball of the night. But after scoring 13 runs off the first three overs of the power play Australia hit 39 off the second three as David Warner, in particular, accelerated. The 35-year-old was at his pugnacious, brutal best before his innings ended in bizarre style immediately after the drinks break. Shadab Khan ripped one past the bat, bowler and wicketkeeper instantly set off in celebration, the umpire raised his finger and the batter trudged angrily from the field.\nPerhaps conscious that New Zealand\u2019s Devon Conway had broken his hand by angrily punching his bat after getting out in the first semi-final he restricted himself to a shake of the head, but he must have been tempted to kick something when he found out there had been no contact between bat and ball, and with reviews in hand had in effect given himself out.\n\u201cI think there was a noise, maybe his bat handle clicked,\u201d Wade said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t think he hit it but I think Glenn [Maxwell] heard the noise, so he thought he might have hit it. It\u2019s really tough in those situations \u2013 how many times do you see a batter think they haven\u2019t hit it and they have? You need a bit of reassurance from the other end, I suppose.\u201d\nAfter Warner\u2019s dismissal and cameos from Steve Smith and Glenn Maxwell, Stoinis and Wade united to steer Australia to victory. It might have been different had Hasan Ali, off the third ball of the 19th over, not misjudged the flight of the ball and dropped Wade at deep midwicket. Had he held on Australia would have needed 20 off 10, far from impossible but certainly a challenge. As it was they ran two, Wade hit the next three for six and that was that.\nOnce they have recovered from their disappointment, Pakistan will find plenty of positives both in this performance and across the tournament. Babar Azam and Rizwan sit first and second on the list of top scorers, the latter overcoming a nervy start to hit 67 off 52 and become the first player in the history of the format to make 1,000 international runs in a calendar year. Fakhar Zaman was outstanding in hitting 55 off 32, while with the ball Shaheen cemented his reputation as the game\u2019s most exciting young seamer and the 23-year-old Shadab Khan was outstanding, and took a wicket in each of his four overs (if you count Warner\u2019s).\nThey came into the competition as rank outsiders but, with another T20 World Cup just 11 months away, are unlikely to be underestimated again.",

But you know we\u2019re still stuck in the same status quo. We\u2019re still stuck in the same problems that led us to end up on hunger strike.\u201d\nHe said he was nearing the end of his hunger strike \u201cas a strategy\u201d. He is urging the Foreign Office to pay a \u00a3400m British debt to Iran, which dates back to the 1970s and is a seen a precondition for the release of his wife and other detainees.\nRatcliffe\u2019s meeting followed talks between UK government officials and Iran\u2019s deputy foreign minister, Ali Bagheri Kani, as part of preparations for the resumption of talks in Vienna at the end of this month on the terms for the US return to the nuclear deal that Donald Trump abandoned in 2018. The talks have been deferred since June after the Iranian presidential elections.\nRatcliffe said Cleverly wanted to emphasise that the meeting with the Iranian delegation had been \u201ccordial\u201d. He added: \u201cHe\u2019d raised Nazanin\u2019s case, the case of the others [detained in Iran]. He said that was a good step. Couldn\u2019t give a timeline on when things were going to move forwards.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cI think things either move forwards or they move backwards. I don\u2019t feel they moved forwards today. It may be that there are parts of the conversation I am not privy to and there are parts the minister shares down the line.\u201d\nOf his hunger strike, he said: \u201cI think there\u2019s a basic medical limit on how long you do a hunger strike for. I made a promise to Nazanin, I made a promise to my family, Mum in particular, and to the family doctors, that I won\u2019t take it too far. But yeah, I don\u2019t think we walk away head held high feeling like it\u2019s all been sorted.\u201d\nIn a statement, the Foreign Office said Bagheri Kani \u201cwas pressed on the need for Iran to urgently release all British nationals unfairly detained in Iran, including Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, Anoosheh Ashoori and Morad Tahbaz\u201d.\nIt added that Cleverly met Ratcliffe again on Thursday \u201cto reaffirm our commitment to reuniting his wife with her family in the UK\u201d.\nEarlier the former foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt said that practicalities, not principles, were holding back the payment of the \u00a3400m British debt to Iran..\nHe said the payment would not be the equivalent of a ransom payment but the settlement of an outstanding debt. \u201cWe are a country that pays its debts,\u201d he said, adding that the money could be paid through a humanitarian channel to avoid any sanctions. He also said he could not foresee any US objections.\nHunt said the principle of the payment was now resolved inside the government, claiming this had not been the case at the time he was foreign secretary in November 2018 and went to Tehran to try to secure Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s release.\nHe said it was possible the payment of the debt was \u201cpractically challenging\u201d.\nHe told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cThere are practical issues with sanctions, but those are things that you can sometimes get around, if you, for example, gave \u00a3400m worth of medicines or something like that.\n\u201cThere are also political considerations, you know, the reactions of people like the United States, but given that President Obama did pay America\u2019s debts to Iran in exactly the same situation, I think it\u2019s unlikely that we would have the same objections from President Biden than we might have had from President Trump.\u201d\nOn the debt, Ratcliffe said: \u201cOur case is associated with the wider manoeuvrings. We are a bargaining chip about the debt, but it is part of a much wider piece about Iran ending sanctions and everyone trying to get the Iran nuclear deal revived. That has got many more moving parts and so is more complicated.\u201d",

If it isn\u2019t, the people being deterred probably are best doing other things. There is no need to \u201ctighten restrictions\u201d on MPs\u2019 second jobs when the obvious solution is to ban them altogether.\nFurthermore, if an MP finds sufficient time to do additional work, even if it is only a few hours a week, he or she is clearly not devoting enough time to constituency work. The argument that a second job provides MPs with greater awareness of \u201creal life\u201d outside Westminster can be countered by making it compulsory for MPs to spend two weeks of their very long summer break shadowing someone in their constituency doing full-time work for less than average pay.\nAlternatively, the minimum age of MPs could become 30, almost fully guaranteeing that some experience of work is gained, prior to entering parliament. Whether \u201csocially useless\u201d work in the City counts as such could be left for the electorate to decide. Bernie Evans Liverpool\n Your report on the MPs who are consultants or advisers outside their parliamentary work (30 MPs who could be affected by proposed consultancy ban, 7 November) reveals some MPs who are paid more than double their MP\u2019s salary by outside interests. If these amounts surprise people on the average UK salary, then they must feel obscene to people on universal credit.\nA small number of MPs are obliged to maintain their professional status by continuing to practise, but this doesn\u2019t apply to Chris Grayling being paid \u00a3100,000 by Hutchison Ports as a \u201cstrategic adviser\u201d. So here\u2019s an idea that the \u201clevelling-up\u201d secretary may like to address: why not apply a universal credit-type rule on MPs\u2019 additional income, so that for every pound received above their salary, their salary is reduced by that same amount?Nick Broadhead Liverpool\n One reason cited for MPs having a second job is that such work keeps them in touch with life outside parliament. This may be a good thing, but the kind of work that appears on the list of their outside activities is generally associated with political influence.\nPerhaps those drafting new rules should permit additional jobs, as long as they are in occupations experiencing shortages of labour \u2013 driving HGVs, jobs in care homes, seasonal work in the fields, or housekeeping jobs in the hotel sector.Les Bright Exeter\n I see that the trade secretary, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, thinks that MPs having second jobs brings a \u201crichness\u201d to the Commons (Report, 8 November). Well, I agree, and see no harm in MPs making ends meet by taking on other work, so long as it does not interfere with their duties as political representatives.\nWhat about a few hours a week shelf-stacking, or pizza-delivering at times when the House is not sitting? Or perhaps covering shifts in a care home \u2013 maybe in their constituencies?\nI\u2019m sure they\u2019d find the odd low-paid worker who could advise on fitting it all in with other responsibilities.Susan LakemanCanterbury\n Have an opinion on anything you\u2019ve read in the Guardian today?

It was claimed military personnel had to intervene when the two SNP MPs involved were rude to airport staff after encountering problems with their Covid passes.\nThose MPs \u2013 Drew Hendry and David Linden \u2013 continued to a welcome dinner for the visiting party, but the Labour MP, Charlotte Nichols, was taken to a hotel and flew home the following day, reports claimed. She is understood to be on medication that may affect her reaction to alcohol.\nOn Thursday night, the SNP hit back after further reports claiming two Conservative MPs on the trip were out drinking late into the night and were hungover the following day.\nA party spokesperson called on the defence secretary to apologise for what he claimed was a \u201cbotched\u201d attempt to divert attention from the \u201csleaze\u201d allegations engulfing the Tories at Westminster.\nA Conservative source did not deny that the party\u2019s MPs, Ben Everitt and Christian Wakeford, had been out for a drink but rejected claims they had turned up with hangovers for events the following day.\nA party source said that it was a \u201cdesperate attempt\u201d to deflect attention from the behaviour of the opposition members on the flight. They said it was \u201cabsurd\u201d to equate MPs going for a drink outside the hours of the visit to the alleged conduct of the opposition MPs. The source said neither Everitt nor Wakeford was hungover and that they had fully participated in the visit the next day.\nEarlier, the Telegraph had quoted Wallace commenting on the opposition MPs\u2019 alleged behaviour on the flight, saying: \u201c[It] shows a lack of respect for the enduring work of our armed forces. The armed forces scheme is an opportunity for both parliamentarians and the military to understand each other. This behaviour puts military personnel in a difficult position and risks undermining respect for parliament.\u201d\nThe Ministry of Defence refused to comment on the claims, instead directing the Guardian to the parties involved and to the Armed Forces Parliamentary Scheme, which organised the trip.\nThe SNP rejected Wallace\u2019s accusation. \u201cThese suggestions are false,\u201d a party spokesperson said. \u201cDrew Hendry and David Linden were honoured to be invited to this important event and attended all engagements, including the welcome meeting and dinner shortly after landing.\n\u201cInstead of trying to divert attention from the Tory corruption scandal engulfing Westminster, Ben Wallace should be apologising for his role in it, including voting to get Owen Paterson off the hook.\u201d\nNicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister and SNP leader, said: \u201cI know Drew and David well. They say these allegations are unfounded and that is something I\u2019ve got confidence in.\u201d\nThe Guardian has approached Labour for comment.",

        "content": "Analysis: the reality looks different as the PM defends his government\u2019s reputation over allegations of sleaze\nAt a press conference on Wednesday, Boris Johnson faced such a barrage of questions about ethical standards in politics that he felt obliged to argue that the UK \u201cis not remotely a corrupt country\u201d.\nThis was an unusual step for a British prime minister to take, and begged the question: well, is it?\nJohnson\u2019s government has faced numerous claims connected to corruption, vested interests and wider misgovernment. Below are some of the main concerns.\nThe catalyst for the current row was Johnson\u2019s decision to try to retrospectively change the system for disciplining MPs so as to avoid punishment for Owen Paterson, a Tory former minister found by the commissioner for standards and by a cross-party committee to have committed an \u201cegregious\u201d breach of lobbying rules.\nThe Commons amendment which quashed any sanction against Paterson was formally in the name of another backbencher, Andrea Leadsom, and was couched in terms of reforming the wider standards system, but the motivation came from No 10, while the use of Paterson\u2019s case and the proposal to create a new standards committee with a built-in Tory majority prompted outrage. Johnson U-turned the next day.\nPaterson\u2019s lobbying was done on behalf of companies who together paid him well over \u00a3100,000 a year. His case brought a fresh examination of the scale of such outside work, mainly done by Tory MPs.\nA Guardian analysis found more than a quarter of Conservative MPs had second jobs, making more than \u00a34m in extra earnings in a year. Some of this has involved worries over potential conflicts of interest, such as former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith, who was paid to advise a hand sanitiser company while he chaired a government taskforce that recommended new rules benefiting the firm\nThe greatest focus has been on Sir Geoffrey Cox, the former attorney general, who has held down the job of being an MP while earning at least \u00a36m extra as a barrister, including a stint working in the British Virgin Islands during lockdown, and using his Commons office for at least one virtual meeting. Cox has denied breaking any rules.\nAt the weekend, an investigation showed 16 of the Tories\u2019 main treasurers in the last 20 years, who made donations to the party of \u00a33m or above, had been made peers.\nJohnson has previously been accused of overt nepotism in his choice of peers, with those chosen including Tory donor Peter Cruddas, in defiance of official advice, his friend Evgeny Lebedev, a string of former colleagues, and his own brother, Jo.\nThe PM was criticised earlier this year for some opacity over revealing details about a luxury villa stay in Mustique funded by a Tory donor. He has since refused to disclose the cost of another donated holiday, this one to Spain.\nMost confusing is who paid for renovations to Johnson\u2019s Downing Street flat, which reportedly cost as much as \u00a3200,000. Although Johnson eventually met all costs above the \u00a330,000 public allowance himself, some bills were initially met by the Cabinet Office and by Tory peer and donor, Lord Brownlow.\nThe independent adviser on ministers\u2019 interests, Lord Christopher Geidt, said Johnson had \u201cunwisely\u201d let the refurbishment begin without knowing how it would be paid for, while the Electoral Commission began an investigation after saying there were \u201creasonable grounds\u201d to suspect offences may have been committed. Finally, the parliamentary commissioner for standards, Kathryn Stone, could also investigate the matter.\nAfter Paterson\u2019s punishment was briefly overturned, one of Johnson\u2019s most senior ministers, business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng, suggested Stone should step down, despite her independent status.\nSince then, Downing Street has twice argued that Stone should not examine two standards issues connected personally to Johnson \u2013 who paid for the flat renovations; and the cost of the free holiday in Spain, provided by one of his ministers, Zac Goldsmith.\nWhile No 10 said these were purely ministerial issues, and thus not within her remit of scrutinising MPs\u2019 behaviour, it raised concerns Johnson and his team were seeking to limit Stone\u2019s powers.\nThe government\u2019s new elections bill would, critics say, greatly reduce the powers of the Electoral Commission, the elections watchdog.\nJohnson is also seemingly intent on making a key ally, former Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre, chair of the broadcasting and telecoms watchdog Ofcom. After Dacre was turned down for the role, ministers reopened the process with a change to the job description, intended to give him a better chance.\nIn November 2020, Geidt\u2019s predecessor as adviser on ministers\u2019 interests, Alex Allan, quit in the wake of Johnson\u2019s refusal to sack Priti Patel despite a formal investigation finding evidence that the home secretary had bullied civil servants.\nThere are wider allegations that the government is trying to ensure that only its supporters are appointed to roles in other bodies, such as the Charity Commission.\nLast year there was widespread criticism after the government conceded it planned to break international law by unilaterally amending post-Brexit provisions for Northern Ireland.\nMore widely, there have been accusations that Johnson signed up to the Northern Ireland protocol in bad faith. Last month, Johnson\u2019s former chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, claimed the UK government always intended to \u201cditch\u201d the protocol and only signed it to help win the 2019 election.",

        "content": "Before he was caught in the T20 World Cup semi-final off a ball he didn\u2019t hit, the Australia opener proved his mettle\nIn the end, the story didn\u2019t entirely deliver for David Warner. But in the end, it delivered enough. For what has felt like so long in the compressed world of short-course cricket, Australia\u2019s opening bat has been out of form, out of runs, out of time, and eventually just out. The one thing he hasn\u2019t been is out of patience. Warner\u2019s reservoir of self-belief is profound enough to hide Loch Ness\u2019s secrets. When he faces a struggle, he endures it until it passes. As he has creaked and stuttered after a couple of difficult stints in the IPL, he hasn\u2019t gone chasing runs with desperate swipes at the ball. He has waited for runs to come back to him.\nIn recent matches at the T20 World Cup, they have started returning. But in Thursday night\u2019s semi-final win over Pakistan, it was rhythm that came back to Warner as well. It came back even while Shaheen Shah Afridi was running wild.\nAustralian cricket parlance enjoys phrasing a leg-before dismissal as having your front pad blown off, and Pakistan\u2019s left-arm quick just about rendered it literal when bowling to Aaron Finch. He followed up by trying to blast off Mitchell Marsh\u2019s boot, though Marsh got an umpiring reprieve.\nAt the other end was Warner. Nobody hits Imad Wasim: the left-arm spinner is a power-play specialist who to this point in the tournament had conceded runs at 5.23 per over. In this match he had gone for six from seven balls before Warner pulled him for a six that just kept going and going over the leg side. The movement sang: that familiar twist through the hips, the high arc of power. Next ball he backed away to lace through cover for four. Imad came over the wicket to change the angle, Warner used it to shovel a boundary over fine leg. The over went for 17, Imad was dragged, and a chase of 177 was genuinely under way.\nThe confluence of timing, mojo and hunger for runs was no better demonstrated than when Mohammed Hafeez got the ball stuck in his hand, dragging an attempted off-break down into the pitch so that it bounced twice on its way to the far end. Most players faced with a double-bouncer are sufficiently surprised that they don\u2019t do much. Warner was off in a flash, running down, grounding his back foot outside the playing strip by the time he dipped his knees, got underneath it on the second bounce, and whacked it for six.\nHe kept toying with the spinners, shifting feet to fake at playing switch-hits as they delivered the ball, before using simpler methods like skipping out to lift Shadab Khan straight down the ground. The tentativeness, the rust, the caution, all of those markers from recent months were gone.\nShadab accounted for him in the end, the leg-spinner\u2019s googly turning away from the left-hander\u2019s bat to land in Mohammed Rizwan\u2019s gloves with the first ball of the 11th over. Bowler, keeper, striker and umpire all thought there was a nick, and replays confirmed a sound, though they also showed it definitely hadn\u2019t come from bat on ball. Warner was given out for 49 from 30 deliveries. He had lost Finch, Marsh, and Steve Smith on the way, and it seemed that his unfortunate dismissal had robbed him of the chance to drive home a win just as he looked so well placed to do it.\nWhat he had done, though, was get Australia to 89 for four, better than half the runs required in half the overs. Glenn Maxwell fell trying to maintain the rate but Marcus Stoinis was able to absorb some quiet overs by finding the boundary just often enough. Needing 62 off 30 balls was stiff but, as Matthew Wade settled in and Pakistan\u2019s spin overs ran out, the batting pair turned the pressure around. The end came in a rush, sixes flowing as the 62 ended up being scored from 24. The total partnership was 81 from 41.\nStoinis and Wade will get the plaudits, and deserve them. Still adjusting to the job of finishing an innings, they have twice won matches at this World Cup while doing it. Going into Sunday\u2019s final against New Zealand, though, it will be at least as important to Australia to have their mainstay opener back at a proper tempo, going with the rhythm of the game rather than fighting it. A fast 49 wasn\u2019t the full story, and a dodgy ending cut it short. But as it turned out, a start was enough.",

The pilot, imprisoned pending trial in the capital\u2019s high-security Korydallos prison, claimed he was thrown into a \u201cblurred state\u201d after his young wife threatened to divorce him. But Noulis described him as being in a \u201ccalm state of mind\u201d.\n\u201cHe had no inhibition to go through with the act despite the fact that she was the mother of his child,\u201d he was quoted as saying in the report. \u201cThe victim was just 20 years old, while he was 13 years older and should have been her protector.\u201d\nThe prosecutor also recommended that he be tried for the crime of animal abuse after allegedly confessing to choking the family\u2019s seven-month-old puppy by hanging it from its own leash as part of the attempt to make the crime look like a burglary.\nThe killing of Crouch in May \u2013 one of 12 femicides to be reported so far this year \u2013 shocked Greece. Police launched a countrywide search for the \u201cruthless gang of foreign thieves\u201d that the pilot blamed for the tragedy. Anagnostopoulos said he had been tied up and blindfolded when his wife was killed.\nIn a rare step, authorities offered a \u20ac300,000 bounty for information that might lead to the murderers.\nAnagnostopoulos was brought in for a final round of questioning \u2013 and arrested \u2013 after police analysis of Crouch\u2019s smartwatch, combined with data downloaded from his own mobile phone, conflicted with his version of events.\nCiting a coroner\u2019s inquest, the prosecutor described Crouch\u2019s death as \u201cagonising\u201d, saying the process of asphyxiation lasted five minutes and induced a state of \u201cphysical and psychic stress\u201d in her during her last moments. The young woman had been asleep for two and a half hours, he said, and was \u201cunsuspecting\u201d.\nThe daughter of a retired oil and gas executive, Crouch was raised on the small island of Alonissos in the Sporades.\nShe met Anagnostopoulos in her mid-teens before marrying him in Portugal at the age of 18.\nThanassis Haramanis, the family\u2019s lawyer, told the Guardian that he expected the trial to take place next year in what would be lightning speed for a judicial system that is notoriously slow. \u201cWe believe it will be listed some time between May and September,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are optimistic.\u201d\nIn a separate development on Thursday, an Athens court awarded custody of the couple\u2019s child to Caroline\u2019s mother, Susan, revoking any parental rights the pilot may have had as her father, and granting limited visitation rights to his parents.\n The headline of this article was amended on 12 November 2021 to clarify the prosecutor\u2019s recommendation.",

Of the more than 1,400 people hospitalized, with a confirmed case of Covid-19, 80% were unvaccinated, according to the Post.\nThe crisis guidelines allow hospitals to redirect health care workers to help out in strained units, with an experienced worker overseeing them; consider having nurses work longer, ideally less-frequent shifts; if possible, have family members or volunteers help patients with hygiene to free up medical staff; and activate the Colorado National Guard for nonclinical jobs, such as Covid-19 testing or delivering supplies.\nWhile trends are improving in Florida, Texas and other southern states that bore the worst of the summer surge, it\u2019s clear that Delta isn\u2019t done with the US. Covid-19 is moving north and west for the winter as people head indoors, close their windows and breathe stagnant air.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to see a lot of outbreaks in unvaccinated people that will result in serious illness, and it will be tragic,\u201d said Dr Donald Milton of the University of Maryland School of Public Health.\nThe Delta variant dominates infections across the US, accounting for more than 99% of the samples analyzed.\nNo state has achieved a high enough vaccination rate, even when combined with infection-induced immunity, to avoid the type of outbreaks happening now, said Ali Mokdad, a professor of health metrics sciences at the University of Washington.\nProgress on vaccination continues, yet nearly 60 million Americans age 12 and older remain unvaccinated. That\u2019s an improvement since July, when 100 million were unvaccinated, said Jeff Zients, the White House Covid-19 coordinator.",

Markle had been accused of giving a \u201ccynical and self-interested response ignoring her pleas for reconciliation in a loving letter\u201d.\nBut Caldecott argued Meghan\u2019s letter to her father was \u201cnot a loving letter, not a generous letter\u201d, containing allegations that were \u201cdemonstrably false\u201d.\nCaldecott said it was perfectly reasonable that Markle assumed his daughter was behind the article and there was an urgency to reply to the claims, as he had been \u201cleft in a lonely place\u201d and the magazine had 40m readers a week. \u201cEither we believe in freedom of expression or we don\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cThomas Markle has been royally attacked in the People magazine \u2026 and this is his reply.\u201d\nIn February, Meghan successfully sued ANL, the publisher of the Mail on Sunday and the MailOnline website, for breach of privacy and copyright, over five articles that published parts of the \u201cpersonal and private\u201d handwritten letter sent to her father.\nA high court judge ruled in her favour, saying publication of the letter to Thomas Markle was \u201cmanifestly excessive and hence unlawful\u201d and could be dealt with by summary judgment without need for a trial. ANL challenged that ruling this week, arguing the case should go to a trial.\nDuring the hearing on Wednesday, Meghan apologised for failing to remember authorising a senior aide to brief the authors of her and Harry\u2019s unofficial biography.\nIn a statement in the court of appeal, Meghan said she could not remember emails between her and her then press secretary, Jason Knauf, about the unauthorised book Finding Freedom by Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand.\nShe said: \u201cWhen I approved the passage \u2026 I did not have the benefit of seeing these emails and I apologise to the court for the fact that I had not remembered these exchanges at the time. I had absolutely no wish or intention to mislead the defendant or the court.\u201d\nLawyers for the duchess said she had provided \u201cbackground information\u201d to the authors of her and Harry\u2019s unofficial biography, but kept the contents of a contested letter to her father secret.\nOn Thursday, Justin Rushbrooke QC, representing the duchess, said that it made \u201cno sense\u201d to argue that the duchess wanted to share the contents of her letter, when the \u201cbackground information\u201d she allowed him to share did not contain details of the letter. \u201cShe had every opportunity. This was the perfect opportunity if you wanted to put it into the public domain,\u201d he argued.\nFurther documents were released that revealed that Knauf, who is due to stand down from his current role as the chief executive of the Royal Foundation at the end of the year, had \u201cregretted\u201d not giving evidence after Meghan won her legal battle against ANL.\nIn a witness statement, Keith Mathieson, a solicitor for ANL, said he believed Knauf\u2019s evidence was \u201chonest and credible\u201d and could not have been obtained earlier.\nMathieson called Knauf \u201ca central figure in the events he describes\u201d and said his witness statement was measured. He added: \u201cGiven the high-profile nature of this litigation and the likelihood of his evidence (if admitted) being widely reported, as well as the position he holds, it is hardly conceivable that he would say anything he did not believe to be true and I know of nothing in his evidence which is subject to any reasonable challenge.\u201d\nThe case was heard by Sir Geoffrey Vos, Dame Victoria Sharp and Lord Justice Bean, who will publish their judgment at a later date.",

It is understood, however, that while Raducanu has an open invitation to Twickenham from the RFU, she is not expected at either Saturday\u2019s match against Australia or the one against South Africa a week later.\nEarlier this week, Jones was criticised for using Raducanu\u2019s perceived loss of form after her sensational US Open victory as a warning to Marcus Smith \u2013 who has been selected to start at fly-half against Australia \u2013 over the dangers of off-field distractions. Jones did not mention Raducanu by name, referring to her as \u201cthe young girl\u201d, which was interpreted by some of his critics as a sexist comment.\nJones insisted, however, that \u201cwas never the aim\u201d and reiterated his initial warning, stating that it is a trap numerous young England players have fallen into. He told the BBC: \u201cThe whole point was how difficult it is for young players to cope with distractions. So the point I made was not wrong. I can\u2019t control if it\u2019s taken out of context. There was no criticism of Emma. I have sent her a letter just to reinforce that and hopefully we\u2019ll see her at Twickenham shortly.\n\u201cI don\u2019t have any misgivings about what I said \u2013 I am disappointed it was taken out of context, and I would be disappointed if Emma was upset by it. It was deemed as being sexist and that was never the aim of the point.\u201d\nAsked if he was aware of the furore his comments created, or had any regrets, Jones added: \u201cI don\u2019t know what was said. I haven\u2019t read it, so if you can enlighten me, I would be happy to discuss it. The point was that it is very difficult for young players in the UK. That was the point and I made that point for a reason because I think it is.\n\u201cWe have a really good group of players coming through with England and I want to make sure we look after them as well as we can. So many good young players come in and get swept away by all the distractions. We don\u2019t want them to be distracted and that was the only purpose of that comment.

The Rams are arguably stronger on defense and last week traded for eight-time Pro Bowler Von Miller, who will play alongside All-Pros Aaron Donald and Jalen Ramsey.\nThe Rams now have arguably the strongest roster in the NFL and their 7-2 record is the second-best in the NFC, just behind their divisional rivals, the Arizona Cardinals (8-1).\nAfter his signing, Beckham referred to the possibility of a championship when Los Angeles hosts the Super Bowl in February.

The 50-year-old has refused to hold negotiations before qualification for the World Cup is secured and could decide to seek a new challenge, but Kane was adamant that the uncertainty is not a distraction for the squad before their final two qualifiers against Albania and San Marino.\n\u201cThat is between the manager and the FA and as players we would never put pressure on a manager to make a decision before then,\u201d Kane said. \u201cObviously we have a job to do in these two games and a job to do going into a big year next year. I don\u2019t think it matters from a player\u2019s point of view if it is decided then or not.\n\u201cI think I speak for a lot of players but personally I get on well with the manager. I think he has been great and his record at international level speaks for itself. We are improving as a team. Semi-final in the World Cup, final in the Euros: we are heading in the right direction. Of course I would love him to stay but it will come down to him and the FA and his personal decision.\u201d\nEngland will be certain of qualification if they take four points from these two games, although they are under pressure before hosting Albania on Friday night.

The winger has started three league games for Manchester City this season.\n\u201cThere is a preference for us that players are playing regularly because they\u2019re match-sharp, but if their physical condition is good then we\u2019ve got to look at who we feel our best players are,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re undroppable, and I think any player in the squad has been in or out at some time, Raheem included.\n\u201cAnd that doesn\u2019t mean if we\u2019re not playing well, we won\u2019t take players off, because we\u2019ve also done that, but there\u2019s a balance with your selection: \u2018OK, who\u2019s in form, but over how long a period is that, have they produced in the big matches yet, do we know quite yet what they can do?\u2019 And Raheem has proved time and time again with us how important he\u2019s been.\u201d\nHowever, Southgate has injury problems.

Examining the period since the landmark Paris agreement was signed in 2015, the analysis found Australia emitted 5.34 tonnes of carbon dioxide per person each year, placing it ahead of South Korea (3.81), South Africa (3.19), the US (3.08) and the world\u2019s biggest outright emitter, China (2.71).\nEmber cited the International Energy Agency to argue OECD countries including Australia should end coal power by 2030 if they were to play their part in attempting to keep global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels \u2013 a goal of the Paris agreement \u2013 within reach.\nThe Morrison government has rejected this and did not join a group of countries that pledged to phase out burning coal for electricity.\nDave Jones, Ember\u2019s global program lead, said Cop26 had seen a divergence between developing Asian countries and major OECD coal users over the need to close coal generation. Vietnam had pledged to stop building coal plants and to stop using it in the 2040s, and Indonesia, the Philippines and India had shown signs they were changing previously held positions.\nHe said by comparison arguments put forward by Australia, Japan and South Korea were \u201cembarrassing\u201d and \u201csimply untenable\u201d.\n\u201cThey will undoubtedly be forced to change their position in the coming months,\u201d Jones said.\nBan Ki-moon, a former UN secretary general and deputy chair of The Elders, an international non-governmental organisation of senior statespeople, said the potential of renewable energy was growing exponentially and OECD countries needed to align with the target of phasing out coal entirely by the end of the decade. \u201cThis will be a true demonstration of global leadership,\u201d he said.\nAbout 60% of Australia\u2019s electricity over the past year came from burning coal. That proportion is gradually diminishing and the country\u2019s coal fleet is ageing, but under current closure schedules it would continue to use coal power until the late 2040s.\nThe Morrison government has been heavily criticised in Glasgow for its ongoing support of fossil fuels. Greenpeace International head Jennifer Morgan grouped it with Saudi Arabia as a \u201cwrecker\u201d opposed to the action needed to cut emissions and provide the finance needed to help developing countries respond.\nAustralia was one of only four countries, along with Indonesia, Mexico and Singapore, that chose to just resubmit the same 2030 emissions target at Cop26. Australia\u2019s has committed to only a 26-28% cut compared with 2005 levels, though government projections suggest it could make a cut of up to 35%, in part due to state government policies. Scientists have advised global emissions need to be cut by 45% by the end of the decade.\nMary Robinson, a former president of Ireland and chair of The Elders, said leaders of developing countries were \u201cin crisis mode\u201d at the talks but some leaders who could do the most to address the problem were not. She bracketed Australia with Saudi Arabia, Brazil, China and Russia.\n\u201cAustralia, a wealthy country, is still in fossil fuel mode, not in crisis mode,\u201d she told the UK\u2019s Sky News.\nThe talks were boosted late on Wednesday by a surprise joint declaration by the two biggest emitters, China and the US, that they would work together to cut emissions in the crucial next decade.\nBut there was significant disagreement between countries over a draft text released Wednesday morning.\nIt included a proposal that countries return to the negotiating table next year with new plans to ramp up emission cuts this decade. Under the Paris agreement, countries are expected to return with better pledges in 2025 but - with a chasm between existing commitments and the deep cuts needed - many are now demanding the deadline should be brought forward.\nThe draft text also proposed countries agree to accelerate the phasing out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels.\nAustralia has not been represented at a political level at the talks since Angus Taylor, the emissions reduction minister, left a week ago, and it has not made public its position on key parts of draft text released on Wednesday morning. But Scott Morrison has previously strongly opposed suggestions coal power should be actively phased out, and said he has no plans to increase Australia\u2019s 2030 commitment.\nIn a statement on Thursday, Taylor said Australia was \u201can active and constructive participant in the negotiations to ensure a positive outcome\u201d.\nThere is dispute between countries over whether the text will keep a reference to the scientific case for limiting global temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, with some large developing countries reportedly opposed. Poor countries said much more needed to be done to increase finance packages to help them cut emissions and cope with the impacts of climate breakdown.\nScientists at the talks expressed frustration that rhetoric from global leaders was not being matched by action, and warned that every extra fraction of a degree of global heating would have dire consequences.",

We have built a really strong squad.\u201d\nClarke went on to cite the situation with Lyndon Dykes, who is suspended and has been recovering from illness and injury. \u201cI had to persuade Lyndon it was a bad idea to fly to Moldova,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cHe phoned us up and said he wanted to fly to Moldova just to watch the game. He was prepared to get on a plane for three hours to watch the team and then fly back with the team to Edinburgh. But I managed to persuade him that he didn\u2019t need to do that.\n\u201cIt shows you the level of commitment I have got from the boys in the squad. That\u2019s what we\u2019re building and I\u2019d rather talk about those people. That commitment is massive for us. It\u2019s why, when you need to score a late goal, that spirit and togetherness is there. That\u2019s when it shines through. That\u2019s when you see it, when we get a result that could have gone the other way. When it\u2019s maybe looking like it\u2019s heading for a draw and we get the win.\u201d\nA Scotland victory here would secure a World Cup play-off berth and render Monday\u2019s visit of Denmark to Hampden Park irrelevant. Scotland have a bleak history of snatching defeat from the jaws of victory in such scenarios, but Clarke insisted his squad are made of stern stuff.\n\u201cI know it\u2019s something historical, but it\u2019s not connected with this team,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cWe went to the Faroes and it was a tough game but we managed to get the result we wanted. We managed to avoid that tag there so hopefully we come out of this game and we\u2019re all in a good place. We\u2019re all looking forward to the play-offs in March. Ultimately, that\u2019s the aim. We have proved that this group has a mentality where they don\u2019t want to drop silly points.\u201d\nWorld Cup qualifying Group C, 5pm GMT Friday 12 November\nMoldova (4-3-3, probable): Avram; Jardan, Posmac, Armas, Marandici; Rata, Ionita, Ginsari; Ghecev, Nicolaescu, Iosipoi.\nSubs from\u00a0Namasco, Celeadnic, Revenco, Bolohan, Potirniche, Spataru, Cociuc, Bogaciuc, Puntus, Dros, Cotogoi.\nScotland (3-4-1-2, probable): Gordon; Hendry, Cooper, Tierney; Patterson, Gilmour, McGregor, Robertson; McGinn; Adams, Brown.\nSubs from\u00a0McLaughlin, Clark, Souttar, McKenna, O\u2019Donnell, Armstrong, McLean, Turnbull, Ferguson, Nisbet.\nReferee\u00a0Srdjan Jovanovic (Ser)\nClarke will be without Scott McTominay, who was sent home from the team\u2019s Spanish training base with a throat infection. The Manchester United player has an outside chance of featuring on Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s always disappointing when you lose a player, especially when you come away in a camp, because it\u2019s more difficult to call someone else up,\u201d said Clarke. \u201cBut I\u2019ve got good cover in both positions that Scott can play, at centre-back and in midfield.\u201d",

        "content": "The Oklahoma City Thunder guard is making waves in his rookie NBA season, as expected according to two Australian basketball figures\nDarryl McDonald has known Josh Giddey since he was a little tyke. The 57-year-old former NBL star, synonymous with the league\u2019s glory years of the 1990s and 2000s, played against Josh\u2019s dad, Melbourne Tigers champion Warrick.\nWarrick Giddey would then serve as assistant coach at the Tigers where McDonald played out his career. They coached juniors together at the Tigers and against each other in school basketball.\nMcDonald remembers Josh Giddey buzzing around basketball camps as a youngster having fun and completing all the drills. More recently, he has worked closely over the last 12 months with the young gun who, as a first-round draft pick, is making waves in his rookie NBA season.\n\u201cThere\u2019s this one day I remember watching him play,\u201d McDonald says. \u201cJosh was playing for the Tigers in the Under-18 championships against Bulleen at the State Basketball Centre [in Melbourne\u2019s outer eastern suburbs].\n\u201cI watched him come off a pick and roll and throw a left-handed dart to the opposite corner. When I saw that I\u2019m thinking \u2018that\u2019s different, I haven\u2019t seen nobody at that age do that\u2019. And mind you, he\u2019s right-handed. I\u2019d heard he was good but it was that game, I thought \u2018OK he\u2019s special\u2019.\u201d\nDuring lockdown in Melbourne last year, a mutual contact reached out to McDonald. \u201cJosh wants to work with you\u201d was the message. So, the pair got to work at Hoop City, a new bayside state-of-the-art basketball facility.\n\u201cI remember him as a little tyke,\u201d McDonald says. \u201cWhen I first started working him out, I walked in and saw him and said to myself, \u2018damn this guy is a 6ft 8in point guard, those guys don\u2019t grow on trees. It was obvious he had NBA potential. His game and what he can do is made for the NBA.\n\u201cI love his poise. You can\u2019t rush him, he plays at his own pace. And he\u2019s a rookie, sixth pick of the draft, people are going to try him but he doesn\u2019t back down and I love that about him.\n\u201cHe\u2019s out there hooping, playing his game, doing what he can do and being effective. Just put the ball in his hands and let him make plays. I look at Luka Doncic and I think Josh has that same ability \u2013 that size, being able to look over defence and make plays.\u201d\nLate in 2020, Giddey headed to Adelaide for his debut NBL season where he would claim Rookie of the Year. At the end of the season, he reconnected with McDonald.\n\u201cHe hit me on Instagram \u2013 \u2018I\u2019m coming home for six weeks, let\u2019s get in the gym\u2019,\u201d McDonald says. \u201cHis agent also hit me and said \u2018I need you to work with him and get him ready before America\u2019, so we went Monday to Friday for about five weeks.\u201d\nIn the lead-up to July\u2019s NBA draft, Giddey would lift weights each morning, shoot with Andrew Gaze then meet McDonald at 8pm.\n\u201cIt was a lot of ball handling, a lot of pick and roll stuff. He worked hard. We\u2019d go an hour and a half every night and he hit every drill hard,\u201d McDonald says. \u201cNot one day did I walk in and have to say \u2018listen dude, if you don\u2019t want to go, take the day off\u2019.\u201d\nWatching Giddey play in the NBA is a \u201cjoy\u201d for McDonald. \u201cI just love what I\u2019m seeing,\u201d he says. \u201cJosh playing but playing really, really well. I mean he\u2019s just turned 19. Watching his ability to create, give people shots, get himself shots. You see why he\u2019s on this stage.\u201d\nJack McVeigh played with Giddey for the Adelaide 36ers last NBL season. He recalls teammate Brendan Teys receiving a call from a private number during a road trip.\n\u201cIt was an NBA scout, might\u2019ve been Golden State,\u201d McVeigh says. \u201cHe didn\u2019t ask a single question about basketball. Teysy said afterwards \u2018it\u2019s so good I didn\u2019t have to lie\u2019. The call was so easy because Josh is a good kid, a great teammate, he listens, his head\u2019s screwed on. He doesn\u2019t take himself too seriously and has all the traits you want in a human being.\u201d\nIt might be tempting to underestimate the pressure Giddey was under in his first NBL year, but McVeigh says the Australian league is \u201cno joke\u201d.\u201cGuys who have played in the NBA were picking him up,\u201d he says. \u201cMy rookie year was tough and I was 21. He was 18, had a lot of pressure and was playing for a life-changing opportunity. And he was cool and calm the entire time.\u201d\nMcVeigh loves the all-in support the Australian basketball community has for its latest breakout star. \u201cFrom kids buying his jersey to playing with him on [video game NBA] 2K to the guys who play major roles in the NBL getting around him and showing him support and love,\u201d he says.\n\u201cEveryone wants the kid to succeed.\u201d",

        "content": "Griffin theatre, SydneySet in one of Australia\u2019s oldest university colleges, playwright Kendall Feaver proffers big ideas and prowling debates \u2013 with no easy answers\nOn Wednesday this week, the New South Wales lower house passed an affirmative consent bill, which could see the Crimes Act changed to specify that consent to sexual activity must be communicated and not assumed. The next day, Sydney\u2019s Griffin Theatre Company opened Wherever She Wanders, a play by award-winning Australian playwright Kendall Feaver, which explores the complex failures of systems, movements and individuals to protect us from sexual harm.\nSet in a residential college on the grounds of an Australian university, the play\u2019s catalyst is an incident that, it would be argued in courts, operated on inferred or assumed consent.\nBut Wherever She Wanders is not interested in the specifics. Instead, it pulls back to examine the ways that rape culture thrives in closed systems like once-single-sex colleges, where songs about rape and objectification are revered like choral hymns and preserved in lovingly-made songbooks.\nNikki Faletau (Emily Havea) attends the college on a full scholarship and has made a habit of calling out these old, troubling behaviours whenever she sees them \u2013 much to the consternation of Jo Mulligan (Fiona Press), the first-ever woman in charge of the college. Jo, a second-wave feminist who has \u201cgotten over\u201d her activism, sees many of Nikki\u2019s complaints as over-sensitive and over-dramatic.\nBut when something happens to sweet fresher Paige Hutson (Julia Robertson) on her first night in residence, Nikki can\u2019t let it go \u2013 and she won\u2019t let Jo dismiss it, either.\nFeaver began writing the play nine years ago, but in late 2021 it lands squarely in the zeitgeist, coming just one month after Diana Reid\u2019s debut novel Love and Virtue: a novel which also examines rape culture in Australian residential colleges, through the lens of a girl who has a murky sexual experience on her first night, and whose more progressive friend takes the story viral. Both book and play refuse to moralise; both find the meeting of ego and social justice measures worrying. Both writers are more interested in complicating our thinking around call-out culture, social justice movements and systemic failures than they are in personal, singular experiences.\nFeaver especially refuses to offer any answers for a better way to handle sexual assault and discrimination, preferring instead to demonstrate how it looks, how it thinks \u2013 how it acts. What gets a little lost in the shuffle, however, is how it feels.\nWe spend time with Nikki \u2013 understanding her fear and anger and commitment to speaking out \u2013 and with Jo\u2019s complex discomfort about the whole situation. Nikki\u2019s entire experience at the college is doubly fraught as a woman of colour in a predominantly white institution, but while Nikki uses Paige\u2019s more palatable experience (Paige is pretty, and white, and innocent) to advance her agenda, the playwright Feaver leaves Paige behind too. We go where Feaver wants to go, and stay grounded in ideas far more than in character, emotion or human experience. How much this will work for individual audience members will vary.\nBut Feaver has director Tessa Leong as her bridge from idea to lived truth, and Leong digs deep into Feaver\u2019s clever and well-researched script, steering her enormous ideas and prowling debates into a deft and stylish production with a natural and satisfying rhythm \u2013 always seeking to find the humanity and hold it up to the light.\nFeaver has a talent for wit, especially to deflect, distract, or muddle with a scene, and Leong ensures that not a single much-needed laugh is missed. Mark Paguio, who plays male student Ghazali \u2013 renamed \u201cGerald\u201d by his white friends \u2013 is a real gift to the production, shouldering the majority of the humour and bringing a surprising cache of warmth and vulnerability to his supporting role.\nThe play straddles physical and online worlds: Paige and Nikki are both gamers and at one point argue in-universe of a fantasy video game, with Paguio and Tony Cogin playing as their avatars in full elf and wizard garb. Ella Butler\u2019s set, simple with a few collegiate adornments and video elements by Susie Henderson, is transformative.\nBut it\u2019s the unwavering, constantly-flowing energy of Leong\u2019s production that leaves the biggest impression. She balances sensitivity (a potentially triggering photo of an assault is projected onstage as a blurred-out preview) with humour (those disturbing songs are harmonised and remixed in a note-perfect second act opener).\nIt\u2019s a bold, ambitious play, hungry to debate and argue and complicate. It isn\u2019t comforting or cathartic. But its questions may linger in the back of your mind, prompting you to seek out the answers for yourself.\n Wherever She Wanders runs at Griffin Theatre Company in Sydney until 11 December",

The research, being presented on Friday at the National Cancer Research Institute (NCRI) festival, showed a 17% drop in cases diagnosed in the under-25s last year compared with previous years.\nThe impact of Covid on adults with cancer is well known. However, previously little has been known about the toll on younger patients.\nAs well as the fall in the overall numbers of children diagnosed with cancer, researchers found that even those whose cancer was spotted last year were more likely to have been diagnosed only after being admitted to intensive care. That suggests long delays in accessing care may have made them much sicker, experts say.\nKate Collins, the chief executive of the Teenage Cancer Trust, said: \u201cUntil now there was limited evidence about the impact of the pandemic on the cancer diagnosis of children and young people. Too often young people with cancer are forgotten or overlooked, especially in data collection, making them invisible in the system. Even before the pandemic, we knew that young people\u2019s route to diagnosis could be long and complicated. Early diagnosis can save lives.\n\u201cThe fact the pandemic has delayed diagnosis is an enormous concern and it is essential to understand not only the reasons the pandemic affected diagnosis but the impact this is having on children and young people with cancer, and what they need now from the healthcare services who care for them.\u201d\nResearchers at the University of Oxford obtained data from 1 February 2020 to 15 August and compared this with the same timeframe in the three years before Covid struck. A total of 380 cancers were diagnosed in children and young people during this six-and-a-half-month period in 2020. The study concluded there was a 17% reduction in the number of cases of cancer diagnosed last year compared with the previous three years.\nThe finding was especially true for tumours of the central nervous system, where there was a 38% reduction in new cases, and lymphomas, where there was a 28% fall.\nThe authors concluded: \u201cThe Covid-19 pandemic has led to substantial reduction in childhood, teenage and young adult cancer detection during the first wave, with an increase in cancer-related ICU admissions, suggesting more severe baseline disease at diagnosis.\u201d\nThe lead researcher, Prof Julia Hippisley-Cox, said: \u201cA possible explanation is that these children waited longer to see a doctor and, therefore, may have been more unwell at the time of their diagnosis.\n\u201cTogether with the lower numbers of cancer diagnoses in the first wave, this study suggests Covid-19 may have had a serious impact on early diagnosis in this group of patients. As we recover from the pandemic, it\u2019s vital that we get diagnosis of cancer in children and young people back on track as quickly as possible.\u201d",

He had threatened to take the home secretary to an employment tribunal hearing.\nResigning in February last year, Rutnam claimed he had been the victim of a \u201cvicious and orchestrated campaign against him\u201d, which Patel had organised. Patel has consistently denied that claim and rejected allegations of bullying.\nA report from the independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, published last week, urged the government to strengthen the powers of the independent adviser on ministers\u2019 interests \u2013 currently Lord Geidt, who was appointed to succeed Allan.\nThe committee said he should be able to launch his own investigations; his reports should be published promptly; and the government should publish the range of sanctions that could be applied to ministers who breach the rules in future.\n\u201cMeaningful independence is the benchmark for any effective form of standards regulation and current arrangements for the adviser still fall below this bar,\u201d the committee said.",

        "content": "Premier Dominic Perrottet opens debate on proposed law in parliament, promising to boost funding to palliative care instead\nThe New South Wales premier, Dominic Perrottet, has split with a number of his most senior ministers in opposing a voluntary assisted dying bill, warning that it would \u201copen a door that no one can close\u201d.\nPerrottet took the unusual step of opening debate on the long-awaited legislation by expressing his strong opposition to voluntary assisted dying and urging his colleagues to consider the \u201cramifications\u201d of supporting the bill by framing it as \u201ca culture-changing decision\u201d that would \u201ccross a line\u201d.\n\u201cThis debate is fundamentally about how we treat that precious thing called human life,\u201d he said.\n\u201cOur answer to that question defines what kind of society we will be. This bill, at its heart, enshrines a new principle: that we can intentionally help terminate the life of certain people to end their suffering.\n\u201cMake no mistake, this is a culture-changing decision. Once we accept the principle of this bill, we cross a line and nothing will be the same, as we will have started to define the value of a life.\u201d\nThe voluntary assisted dying bill was introduced by the independent MP Alex Greenwich in October along with 28 co-sponsor MPs from across the political spectrum.\nIf passed, the bill would make NSW the last state to allow euthanasia, limiting access to people with terminal illnesses who will die within six months, or 12 months in the case of a person with a neurodegenerative condition who was experiencing unbearable suffering.\nOn Friday Perrottet said the debate over the bill was \u201cnot abstract\u201d to him, and talked about visiting his dying grandmother in hospital a week ago.\n\u201cI sat next to her, holding her hand. I could tell that she was in great pain and that she wanted it to be over,\u201d he said. \u201cI got a sense, as much as anyone can have, why those in such pain would want to end it quickly. So this debate is not abstract for me.\u201d\nOne of Perrottet\u2019s first acts as premier was to grant a conscience vote on the bill, and his opposition to the legislation has seen him split from a number of the governments most senior MPs.\nOn Friday, planning minister Rob Stokes, customer service minister Victor Dominello and the now-former transport minister Andrew Constance, who is retiring from NSW politics to run for the federal seat of Gilmore, all spoke in support of the bill.\nConstance, who has been a vocal supporter of the bill, spoke without notes as he told the parliament the bill was about ensuring people suffering a terminal illness were \u201cable to ensure they are in control of their body and their life\u201d.\n\u201cI wish this was government legislation,\u201d he said.\nOpponents of voluntary assisted dying bills both in NSW and other states have sought to argue for an increase in funding for palliative care rather than assistance to die. On Friday Perrottet launched the same argument, saying that as treasurer he had \u201cfailed to deliver\u201d adequate palliative care in the state.\n\u201cYes, we have increased funding, but not as much as we should have,\u201d he said.\nDuring his speech, Perrottet committed to funding \u201cthe best palliative care, not just in the nation but in the world\u201d, saying many supporters of voluntary assisted dying \u201cdo not have confidence they will have adequate care and relief\u201d when suffering from a terminal illness.\n\u201cWell they should have confidence and the buck stops here,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have failed to deliver that care and as the former treasurer I take responsibility for that. Let me be clear: I failed in my former capacity as treasurer to address this issue, but as premier I will fix it.\u201d\nBut voluntary assisted dying advocates say the focus on palliative care is misplaced. In October Assoc Prof Charlie Corke, a senior intensive care specialist and the acting chair of the Victorian Voluntary Assisted Dying Review Board, told the Guardian that most people who accessed the scheme in the state were already in palliative care.\n\u201cHowever much funding you have for palliative care, there will still be a certain number of patients who would like to have control at the end of their lives,\u201d he said.\nDuring the debate on Friday, supporters of the bill, including one of its co-sponsor\u2019s, Labor\u2019s shadow transport minister, Jo Haylen, took aim at attempts to \u201cpit palliative care and voluntary assisted dying against one another\u201d.\n\u201cIt is simply wrong, however, to suggest that palliative care and voluntary assisted dying are at opposite ends of the spectrum,\u201d she said. \u201cPalliative care is focused squarely on quality of life and treats the stress and symptoms of terminal illness. What it can\u2019t do is address the underlying illness.\u201d\n Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nShe read correspondence from constituents who talked about watching terminally ill family members suffer, including a woman whose aunt \u201cwas essentially slowly starving to death\u201d in the absence of access to voluntary assisted dying.\nConstance too dismissed arguments about palliative care, saying: \u201cthis debate isn\u2019t about palliative care. It\u2019s not about advanced care directives. They remain in place\u201d.\n\u201cWhat it is about is our ability when diagnosed with a terminal illness and facing death to ensure you can have your loved ones with you holding your hand in a conscious state knowing that you are together in love and support and not going to potentially suffer what is around the corner in terms of a horrendous, horrendous death,\u201d he said.\nBoth major parties have granted a conscience vote on the bill, and it is also opposed by the Labor leader, Chris Minns. Debate on the bill will continue into next year after both major parties agreed to refer it to an upper house inquiry, which is not due to report until February.\nConstance on Friday took a swipe at that decision, saying he wanted the bill to pass both houses this year.\n\u201cThere is the opportunity for the legislative council to continue to sit and get this bill through and not let people suffer any longer,\u201d he said.\nSeparately on Friday the Greens MP David Shoebridge introduced a new bill to parliament that would lift the age of criminal responsibility to 14. The bill would see the parliament consider lifting the age of responsibility from 10 years old for the first time.\n\u201cAt ages 10 and 11 children are still losing their baby teeth, they don\u2019t have their pen licences let alone driver\u2019s licences,\u201d Shoebridge said.",

But it has been in the making for much longer.\n\u201cThis project has been in the pipeline for well over 20 years from the first idea, so today is a milestone,\u201d said Tammy Schoo, the acting area chief manager for the Grampians national park.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a really complex project both in its planning and its construction.\u201d\nThe trail has 11 bookable campsites and for most of its length is a grade 4 walk with steep climbs and descents.\nSome sections are slightly flatter and easier and there are also some more challenging grade 5 sections in the central Grampians south of Halls Gap.\nThe trail was built in stages. The first stage, a 60km section from Halls Gap to Bugiga, involved improving or slightly modifying existing tracks and opened in 2015.\nSchoo said the work to complete the remaining 100km required construction in remote areas with materials brought in by helicopter.\nThe trail extends over the ancestral lands of the Djab Wurrung and Jadawadjali people and Parks Victoria worked with traditional owners to guide the trail alignment and shape the visitor information and stories.\nMore than 90 wildlife species live in the park and 900 types of plants \u2013 49 of which are unique to the national park.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fantastic opportunity for people to immerse themselves in the environment and the culture of the area and walk the walk in a respectful way,\u201d Schoo said.\nThe project was jointly funded through $23.2m from the Andrews government and $10m in federal funding provided through the Horsham Rural City council.\nLily D\u2019Ambrosio, Victoria\u2019s environment minister, said 34,000 walkers a year were expected by 2025, generating $6.39m in economic benefits and tourism development opportunities.\n\u201cThe value of our parks and reserves has become more evident in recent times, which is why we\u2019re boosting investments in projects that protect our natural places and support local communities and regional economies,\u201d she said.\nEarly in the trail\u2019s development, conservation groups raised concerns about what is known as \u201cinfrastructure creep\u201d, which refers to the expansion of accommodation and other recreational infrastructure in pristine areas.\n Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nBut Matt Ruchel, the executive director of the Victorian National Parks Association, said plans for several huts and more high-end accommodation along the trail had been revised, with most now focused in existing town centres.\nThe trail itself features small huts at two of the campgrounds.\nRuchel said those changes had helped minimise the intrusion of the trail into unique areas.\n\u201cWe have to be careful in the future that new trails don\u2019t compromise the integrity of the places people come to look at,\u201d he said.",

        "content": "The tribe could be granted a special waiver after a lengthy legal battle to try to resume the historic practice\nHunting gray whales has long been a sacred tradition for the Makah Tribe, dating back thousands of years. But in recent decades, the practice has faced severe scrutiny from conservationists, and the tribe, located in Washington state, has fought a lengthy legal battle to try to resume the historic practice.\nNow, the situation could be finally gearing up to a resolution.\nOn Saturday, a public comment period is set to close, opening the doors for a key determination by the National Marine Fisheries Service on whether to grant the tribe a special waiver.\nThe granting of such a waiver would set Makah Tribe members on a path to finally resume the sacred whaling practice that dates back at least 2,700 years.\nThe comment period came after a recent recommendation to the US Department of Commerce in support of awarding the tribe a waiver under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, which bars the killing of marine mammals.\nAdministrative law judge George J Jordan stated in his recommendation that the eastern North Pacific gray whale stock \u201cwill not be disadvantaged by the issuance of a waiver\u201d and the authorized take \u201cwill not meaningfully affect its distribution, breeding, or migratory habits\u201d.\nAccording to a spokesperson for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), such a recommendation could have a major influence on the final decision.\nJordan\u2019s recommendation included proposed regulations, such as allowing Makah tribal members to hunt for only four months beginning on 1 July on odd years, and strike up to two eastern North Pacific gray whales. During even years, they would be allowed to hunt for six months beginning on 1 December and strike no more than three.\nIn the ensuing weeks, community members and environmental groups submitted over 100 comments in response to the recommendation. The majority, based on an examination by the Guardian, were against whaling, with some claiming the tribe no longer needed whales for sustenance, while others argued the creatures needed to be protected. Some that did support the waiver, cited the tribe\u2019s sovereign rights and long history of whaling.\nNoaa Fisheries\u2019 decision on whether to grant a waiver \u2013 the timing of which is unclear \u2013 is expected to be based on such documents as the judge\u2019s recommendation, submitted comments and a forthcoming supplement to the 2015 draft environmental impact statement.\n The Makah Tribe, which today includes about 3,100 enrolled members, features the sentient creatures in their dances, songs, visual arts and family crests, explained the Makah tribal council chairman, Timothy J Greene Sr. At the same time, whale hunting has long been completed through a process of giving thanks and acknowledgment for a gift given to them by the Creator. And if the hunts were successful, according to Chairman Greene, tribal members used virtually every part of the creatures, from their bones and meat to their intestines and baleen.\n \u201cWe acknowledge the life of the whale in the process and ceremonies,\u201d he said. \u201cWe give that life the respect that it deserves. We believe that that life isn\u2019t taken by us, but that the creature chooses to give its life to us to sustain us and carry out our connection with the ocean and with that part of the natural world.\u201d\n In the Treaty of Neah Bay of 1855, the tribe gave up hundreds of thousands of acres of land, while explicitly securing the right to whale in \u201cusual and accustomed grounds and stations\u201d.\n In the 1920s, with commercial whaling and a clear decline in the whale population, the tribe voluntarily paused the hunts.\n Chairman Greene said the tribe\u2019s most recent successful hunt was in 1999, soon after gray whales were removed from the endangered species list. The lead-up to the hunt involved community members praying and fasting, as well as intense training and other preparation by the whaling crews.\n The hunt \u201cwas a moment that really brought joy to the community, it brought the community together in a way that I haven\u2019t seen since\u201d, he said.\n But there was also intense pushback from conservation groups, including from the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, a non-profit marine conservation organization based in Washington state. A spokesperson for the organization declined the Guardian\u2019s request for an interview.\n Now, after years of working through the legal process of trying to return to whaling, tribal members will probably soon see a key decision made. But even if the waiver is granted, there are more steps involved before they could actually go out and hunt, including the tribe having to apply for a hunting permit.\n DJ Schubert, wildlife biologist for the Animal Welfare Institute, which opposes the Makah Tribe resuming gray whale hunting, said it was impossible to humanely kill such a large creature. He said their opposition also stems from the decline in the eastern North Pacific gray whale population since 2019 due to an unusual mortality event, as well as concern that the endangered western North Pacific gray whales could be mistakenly hurt or killed.\n \u201cWhile we respect the Makah, we respect their culture and their traditions, and we firmly believe that they should continue to celebrate whales through dance and song and storytelling and so on and so forth, we simply disagree with them as to whether or not it is legally or scientifically or ethically appropriate to hunt gray whales,\u201d said Schubert.\nChairman Greene compared the community no longer hunting whales to a member of the Catholic church being denied communion.\n\u201cIt\u2019s that deep,\u201d he added.\nJohn Hocevar, Greenpeace USA oceans campaign director, said in an email that whether or not the Makah assert their treaty rights and continue their tradition of whaling should be up to the tribe.\nHe said: \u201cSubsistence hunts by Indigenous peoples have a long history, and have never put entire populations at risk \u2026 As we think about the major course corrections that humanity must undergo today, we might benefit from seeing what we can learn from Indigenous communities that have been much more successful at living in balance with nature than those who colonized their lands and waters.\u201d",

And that\u2019s very disorientating for the bees. One moment you\u2019ve got a bout of extreme weather, the next a sudden change with no warning at all.\nIn late February, as we were heading into spring, it snowed. In summer you\u2019ll have three days, say, of downpours that are the equivalent of two months\u2019 worth of rain. Then 10 days of unbelievably high temperatures as we had in August before the fires. We\u2019ve never seen anything like it.\nThe bees aren\u2019t reacting at all well. Insects are sensitive to climate change. After the blazes, their behaviour changed and they were incredibly aggressive.\nI\u2019m the third generation in my family to keep bees although the only member to do so professionally.

A lot ends up in supermarkets in Europe.\nTo say the fires have been a catastrophe is an understatement. They were the biggest on record and took two weeks to extinguish. We\u2019re still numb.

        "content": "Mukuru, one of Kenya\u2019s largest informal settlements, has cleaned up its act with improved water, roads and sanitation \nThe people who live in Mukuru, one of the vast, sprawling \u201cinformal settlements\u201d in Nairobi, used to dread the rains, when the slum\u2019s mud-packed lanes would dissolve into a soggy quagmire of sewage, stagnant water and slimy rubbish.\nBut a few years ago, things began to change. On a newly paved road Benedetta Kasendi is selling sugar cane from a cart. It gives her a clean platform, somewhere she can keep her wares tidy. Her biggest challenge now is what to do with the sugar-cane waste as she does not want to clog up Mukuru\u2019s revamped sewers.\n\u201cYou can have a piece of sugar cane here. The place is clean now,\u201d Kasendi tells Patrick Njoroge, programme officer at the Akiba Mashinani Trust (AMT), a fund that raises capital for slum improvement projects. Njoroge has been working for the past 10 years on a masterplan for Mukuru, and he knows how filthy the place used to be.\n\u201cThis road was more of an open sewer. It is not a place you could have wished to spend an extra second. Walking was dangerous as one risked falling into the sewer. This lady set up here after the road was rehabilitated \u2013 slum upgrading spurs new businesses, however small,\u201d says Njoroge.\nA few metres away, Diana Mwende lines up jerrycans at a kiosk where free fresh water is available. \u201cI used to walk 30 minutes to fetch water. Today, that walk has been reduced to two minutes since these water points were installed in our neighbourhood,\u201d she says.\nThe improvements save her more than time: \u201cI used to pay 400 shillings [\u00a32.70] for water every month and 1,000 shillings to access the communal toilet. Now I have a clean toilet by my house.\u201d\nKasendi and Mwende are among thousands who have benefited from a community-based programme to upgrade one of Africa\u2019s biggest informal settlements and whose success will be used to transform similar slums in Kenya and beyond.\nThe ambitious project follows consultations with more than 40 organisations led by the Muungano Alliance, an umbrella body driving reforms in Kenya\u2019s informal settlements, and including universities, civil societies, the private sector and Nairobi county government. The goal is to make the slum a \u201chealthy, functional city neighbourhood\u201d.\nCommunity involvement in improving the sprawling 243-hectare (600 acre) slum was the key. A resident was chosen to represent groups of households and thousands of people were asked for their views; 250 community mobilisers were engaged to raise awareness of the project. Residents were trained to collect data \u2013 a huge task given the size of Mukuru, which has a population generally estimated to be at least 400,000. Every latrine, water tap and electricity pole in the settlement was mapped.\nOne of the most urgent issues was toilets, and there were many requests to replace the 3,800 filthy pit latrines. Now, 1,000 households have access to flushing toilets and running water.\nThe government has approved the construction of 13,000 new houses in Mukuru, the first social housing project in Kenya. \u201cSo far, half of the 52km [32 miles] of roads earmarked for Mukuru have been completed, and residents are already benefiting from a couple of new hospitals that offer 24-hour medical services,\u201d says Njoroge.\nMukuru was originally allocated by the Kenyan government to politicians and owners of businesses in the 1980s and 1990s to develop light industries within a two-year period. Failure to do so would see the grantees lose their claims to the land.\nAs years passed without any development, slum landlords descended on the vacant land and built unregulated structures for rent. Mukuru eventually grew to nearly 10% of Nairobi\u2019s population, all living in squalor.\nThere are other hazards too: in September 2011, more than 100 people died in an explosion after a fuel spill in a section of the slum known as Sinai. The victims had rushed to collect leaking fuel when it was ignited. Illegal electricity connections have resulted in similar tragedies.\nResidents have lived under the shadow of eviction by those originally given the land. Those who had settled on land set aside for public utilities such as roads, railways and power lines have fought endless legal battles with authorities trying to bring some form of order, while others have died when the land flooded. People in Mukuru also have to deal with cartels controlling basic services such as toilets and rubbish disposal. It makes for a tense atmosphere.\nJane Weru, executive director of the AMT, part of the Muungano Alliance, was involved in the upgrading plans from the outset. She has been championing the rights of slum dwellers for 20 years, with little input from the authorities. But Mukuru is the first informal settlement in Africa to be declared a special planning area (SPA), with the Kenyan government hoping to replicate this model in other slums such as Kibera, Mathare, Korogocho and Kawangware.\n\u201cWe had not planned to go to Mukuru,\u201d says Weru. \u201cA resident came to us and requested our help in buying the land on which his house stood from the original owner. First, we thought it was just this one person who needed help but more came forward with similar issues. Insecure land tenure, where close to 94% of people are tenants, has led to poor planning and hence lack of basic services. It was a systemic problem that needed a broader and multidisciplinary approach.\u201d\nThe trust also realised that living in a slum was expensive. \u201cThe little money each household had was being gobbled up by cartels,\u201d says Weru. \u201cThe 2,000 shillings each household paid as monthly rent amounted to more than 180m shillings [\u00a31.2m], yet those collecting this cash paid no taxes. The cartels were charging exorbitant fees for water and sanitation services, while endangering people\u2019s lives through illegal electricity connections.\u201d\nIn 2017, when Mukuru became part of the city administration\u2019s SPA upgrading scheme, a report found slum dwellers faced a \u201cpoverty penalty\u201d, paying more for basic services than those in richer suburbs.\nThe report found: \u201cMukuru households pay 45%-142% more in their electricity bills than residents enjoying formal [mains connection]. The poverty penalty for water is especially crippling as slum dwellers usually consume less water, at lower quality, but at higher costs than residents with formal provision. Residents pay 172% more per cubic metre of water than rates paid by residents living in formal areas.\u201d\nMukuru\u2019s upgrading programme has attracted attention in other countries across Africa, including Zambia, Malawi, Sierra Leone and Ghana.\nJesse DeMaria-Kinney, the of the Adaptation Research Alliance, a group of nearly 100 organisations helping vulnerable communities says: \u201cBecause of the specific risks these communities face due to climate change, we have to urgently support initiatives with inclusive action over rhetoric.\n\u201cBringing slum dwellers into the research and policy aspects can ensure that outcomes are appropriate, desirable, actionable and lead to improvements in their lives,\u201d he says.\nSign up for a different view with our Global Dispatch newsletter \u2013 a roundup of our top stories from around the world, recommended reads, and thoughts from our team on key development and human rights issues, delivered to your inbox every two weeks:",

Its restaurant and street-food scene is one of the UK\u2019s most exciting. Here are 10 vibrant and creative picks.\nBest known for their Anglesey restaurant The Marram Grass (temporarily closed at the time of writing), Liverpool-raised brothers chef Ellis and restaurateur Liam Barrie opened this persuasively glamorous spot on the Albert Dock last year. Ellis uses prime seasonal produce from Merseyside and north Wales, including pork reared on the brothers\u2019 own smallholding, and serves it in dishes which, for all the painstaking tweezer work visible in the open kitchen, deliver seriously gutsy flavours. An arrangement of ceps and girolles on grilled focaccia is next-level mushrooms on toast, autumn in edible form. Similarly, a plate of grilled mackerel paired with dill cream, buttermilk and cucumber tartare is, for all its clean, fresh elements, stridently flavoursome. Relaxed, chatty service and a vintage rock and soul soundtrack (nice to hear the chefs singing along) complete an unusually warm fine-dining experience.Menus from \u00a335, outdoor seating available, Britannia Pavilion, Albert Dock,  lerpwl.com\nThis stripped-back bar, restaurant and summer garden is a little slice of hipster Brooklyn on Hardman Street. Interesting wines by the glass, Pitchfork-adjacent playlist, a general air of laid-back cool\u2026 and there\u2019s substance, not just vibe. In the best Italian tradition, the kitchen\u2019s handmade, fresh pasta dishes use high-quality ingredients (pork and fennel sausage, squash, sage, tomato, olives, capers, sensational rocket pesto) to create vivid flavours. Incidentally, if you are wondering what happened to neighbour The Wild Loaf (awesome baking and grilled cheese sandwiches), it is currently retailing online (thewildloafshop.com) ahead of a comeback at a new location in 2022. Mains from \u00a38, outdoor seating available, 24 Hardman Street, buyers-club.co.uk\nPeter Kinsella has spent more than a decade scouring the Catalan region and wider Spain for exceptional artisan ingredients, and you can taste that research in every mouthful. Whether you\u2019re eating seared presa iberico pork (the shoulder muscle, which cannot be air-dried) in the restaurant or grabbing a sandwich from the deli (spicy, rugged chorizo with super-sweet piquillo peppers is a timeless combo), this is Iberian food full of big, punchy flavours. There is a second site, cosy Lunyalita, in the Albert Dock.Tapas \u00a35-\u00a310, card only, outdoor seating available, 55 Hanover Street, lunya.co.uk\nSupermarket eJoy Asian Foods contains a strip of hot food kiosks and a seating area where you can dig deep into everything from three-meat-roasts on rice to beef tripe noodle broths and spicy braised pigs\u2019 trotters. Do not miss Xiao Long Bao\u2019s wontons, eponymous pork-and-crab soup dumpling or its steamed spicy beef buns. Its garlicky, ginger-mined pork and Chinese cabbage dumplings are sensational and, at \u00a36 for 13, a filling meal at a budget price.Buns from \u00a31.20, dumplings \u00a36, eJoy Asian Foods, 8-10 Myrtle Street\nThis food hall was an instant hit, and it is easy to understand why. Great staff, good food \u2013 Kelp\u2019s fish dishes; Bone And Block\u2019s burger and steaks; Cahita\u2019s Cubano sandwich, among others \u2013 and this handsome building combine in a way that makes you want to linger. It just feels right. The mezzanine restaurant space, previously home to the excellent northern Spanish-inspired Pilgrim (reopening early 2022 at a new site), will from 22 November be occupied by \u201cscouse brasserie\u201d Barnacle (snacks \u00a33.50-\u00a310, menus from \u00a328), a collaboration by several chefs, including local legend Paul Askew, chef-owner of the elegant Art School. Barnacle will celebrate Merseyside produce and the global influences that shaped the city.Mains from about \u00a38. Mainly QR-code, card-only ordering; cash accepted at front kiosk and for takeaway. 46 Duke Street, dukestreetmarket.com\nAlongside the likes of Bold Street Coffee and Gujarati snack slingers Bundobust, Maray is a linchpin of Bold Street\u2019s food scene. Its post-Ottolenghi menu of falafel and shawarma, whipped goat\u2019s cheese and \u201cdisco cauliflower\u201d (slathered in chermoula, harissa, tahini, yoghurt, pomegranates and almonds) helped usher in a new era of fashionable, casual food in Liverpool. More recently, next door to its third Albert Dock site, Maray opened The One O\u2019Clock Gun (meals from about \u00a37), a pub-Parisian bar hybrid. It serves eco-friendly tap wines, cans and bottles from local brewers Love Lane, Carnival and Black Lodge and, most notably, pies from one of Britain\u2019s top makers, Great North Pie Co. Its Dewlay\u2019s lancashire cheese pie with caramelised white onions is, like Maray, a contemporary classic.Plates from \u00a35-\u00a312, 91 Bold Street, maray.co.uk\nA former Michelin star holder at Devon\u2019s Treby Arms, chef Anton Piotrowskicreates beautifully designed and intensely flavoured dishes. But from snacks of, say, sourdough with Bovril butter to a Strawberry Field Forever dessert, via quail Kiev, Piotrowski\u2019s take on fine dining is shot through with a playful sense of nostalgia and fun. Newer dishes, such as nori-wrapped lemon sole with passion fruit beurre blanc, are as chic as this Rodney Street dining room. Menus from \u00a345, 16 Rodney Street, roskirestaurant.com\nCains Brewery Village \u2013 a sprawling collection of bars, venues, retailers and rehearsal space in the Baltic Triangle \u2013 is home to the city\u2019s pre-eminent street food hub, Baltic Market. It is a big, bustling warehouse affair serving tasty food from the likes of Hafla Hafla (lamb kofta and green chilli tahini, or Persian chicken kebabs), breakout lockdown star Bubbas Trap Kitchen, and Pattersons buttermilk-fried chicken. If you happen to be staying in Toxteth, Wavertree or Sefton Park, note that two of Baltic\u2019s best-loved traders \u2013 Little Korea in its spin-off Love Kimchi, and Neapolitan pizza perfectionist Little Furnace \u2013 both have takeaways on Smithdown Road. (Little Furnace is awaiting a new extension before reopening for eat-in diners.)Meals from about \u00a37, card-only, app-ordering, outdoor seating available. Stanhope Street, balticmarket.co.uk\nIf Smithdown Road is emerging as a foodie enclave, Belzan has a lot to do with that. Co-owned by chef Sam Grainger, this intimate \u201cneighbourhood bistro\u201d is far sharper than that tag perhaps implies. Quality seasonal produce and plenty of artisan graft (fermenting, home-curing, baking) underpin a menu of clever, globally inspired sharing plates such as rare-breed lamb chops with anchovy, peas and yuzu, or gnocchi with locally cultivated mushrooms (grown in waste coffee grounds), wild Sefton Park garlic and cured egg yolk. The Belzan team also operate the Albert Dock\u2019s Madre, a far bigger, livelier bar and taco restaurant with weekend DJs and, in summer, a packed sun-trap courtyard. Those tacos (\u00a310 or \u00a312 for three) deliver plenty of flavour \u2013 try the Oaxaca cheese and slow-cooked beef shin, served with a fantastic spicy beef and onion broth.Plates \u00a34-\u00a316, 371 Smithdown Road,  belzan.co.uk\nIn an uncertain world, you can rely on Elite Bistros. Chef-owner Gary Usher\u2019s six-strong north-west restaurant group has created a culture and talent pool that makes it a touchstone of quality. Breakfast is no longer on the menu (it may return in 2022), but otherwise it is business as usual in the exposed-brick interior of this Georgian building. From classics such as beef featherblade with truffle and parmesan chips to torched salmon with a prawn-cabbage dumpling and warm tartare, expect populist, on-point cooking with a modish flourish.Two courses from \u00a320, 60 Seel Street, wreckfish.co",

        "content": "Negotiators in Glasgow are working to come to an agreement as the conference enters its final day\nCountries are being called on to accelerate the phaseout of coal power at the Cop26 summit, and to return to the negotiating table next year with improvements to their national plans on cutting greenhouse gases.\nThe second draft of the key outcome from the Cop26 summit, now nearing its final hours in Glasgow after a fortnight of intense talks, showed a slight softening of language in some instances but retained the core demands for a return.\nThe three architects of the landmark 2015 Paris climate agreement have told the Guardian that a return to the negotiating table next year to revise countries\u2019 national emissions-cutting targets \u2013 known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs) \u2013 must be the key outcome of the talks if the world is to limit global heating to 1.5C.\nThere was a slight change in the language in the text with regards to NDC revisions \u2013 the previous text, published on Thursday morning, \u201curged\u201d parties to make revisions, while the current draft \u201crequests\u201d them to do so. However, the latter mirrors the language used in the Paris agreement, so the change was not regarded as a significant weakening.\nThe latest draft proposal from the Cop26 chair, released soon after 7am on Friday in Glasgow, calls on countries to accelerate \u201cthe phaseout of unabated coal power and of inefficient subsidies for fossil fuels.\u201d\nA previous version on Wednesday had called on countries to \u201caccelerate the phasing out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuel.\u201d\nThe addition of \u201cinefficient\u201d could help countries that want to retain some fuel subsidies for the poor, while removing subsidies for major fossil fuel interests. This change to the language could also provide cover for countries that want to retain subsidies, however.\nThe issue of fossil fuel subsidies has long vexed climate experts, with calls to reduce the subsidies over two decades going largely unheeded. However, to have any language on phasing out fossil fuels and subsidies to them in the cover decision of a Cop is new and if the provision is retained in the final outcome it will mark an increased determination by many countries to face down fossil fuel producers at the talks.\nA requirement for countries to revise NDCs reflects the expression of alarm by many parties, including the most vulnerable developing countries, over the chasm between carbon targets and the deep cuts necessary to limit temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.\nCurrent national plans \u2013 known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs) \u2013 would lead to 2.4C of heating, according to an influential analysis this week by Climate Action Tracker.\nCountries are currently expected to return with better pledges in 2025, under the Paris agreement, but many are now demanding the deadline should be brought forward. This is seen as the most closely fought area of disagreement as the UK hosts struggle to broker a deal.\nThe question of when and how to revise NDCs is crucial because although the Glasgow talks will continue at least to the end of Friday, and probably well into this weekend, there is now no possibility that governments will toughen their NDCs at this summit. But a clause in the draft text that will form the main outcome of the talks would allow for a return next year to update and strengthen the targets.\nDeveloping countries are concerned that there is not enough reassurance for them for them on climate finance, a core issue for countries struggling to cope with the impacts of extreme weather.\nHelen Mountford of the World Resources Institute said that the draft showed some progress in this area. \u201cSome elements look like they could be stronger, particularly adaptation, finance and loss and damage, that was really very much needed,\u201d she said. These issues are the funding for clean development, adapting to climate impacts and paying for unavoidable damage. \u201cIt is now giving specific dates, requesting countries to double adaptation finance by the end of 2025.\u201d\nBut she added: \u201cOn the $100 billion [promised] from 2020 annually, there\u2019s still no reference to making up the shortfall since we know countries failed to meet that goal in 2020 and 2021. So that\u2019s definitely a gap.\u201d The $100bn was promised back in 2009, to be delivered in 2020 and the failure has damaged trust between rich donor nations and poorer recipient nations.\nExperts said on Friday morning that negotiators would now be in close consultation with senior officials in their country capitals, as aspects of the text would need to be decided at the highest levels of government for many countries. The text is regarded as strong by many developing countries, but they expect it to come under fierce attack today from fossil fuel producing countries in particular.\nFinance ministers are expected to meet at 11am, with a stock take by all parties expected at midday. The UK\u2019s Cop president Alok Sharma is engaged in last-minute shuttle diplomacy among parties.\nBob Ward, of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change said: \u201cThis text appears to deal with many of the major issues that need to be resolved, but some important aspects still need to be finalised and may take some time to conclude. The text \u201crequests\u201d, rather than commits, countries to deliver updated and more ambitious pledges by the end of next year, recognising that the planned emissions cuts collectively are still not consistent with holding warming to no more than 1.5 Celsius degrees.\u201d\nBut he added: \u201cThe call for countries to phase-out unabated coal power and inefficient fossil fuel subsidies is very important and historic. Unabated coal power releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, and all subsidies for fossil fuels are inefficient.\u201d\nSince the Paris agreement was signed, binding countries to limit temperature rises \u201cwell below\u201d 2C above pre-industrial levels while \u201cpursuing efforts\u201d to a 1.5C limit, new science has shown that breaching the 1.5C threshold would lead to disastrous impacts, some irreversible, including the inundation of many low-lying areas. Heating has now reached 1.1C, and extreme weather is already taking hold around the world.\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said emissions must be cut by 45% by 2030 compared with 2010 levels to stay within 1.5C.\nThe new draft outcome text will be discussed ahead of the 6pm UK time deadline for the talks to finish. However, previous Cop summits have a history of going well into Saturday and sometimes Sunday.\n This article was amended on 15 November 2021. The IPCC has said emissions must be cut by 45% by 2030 compared with 2010 levels, not 2030 levels as stated in an earlier version.",

I am not aware of any evidence to suggest that this is happening and would welcome sight of any data you have.\u201d\nTensions are simmering between GPs and the government since Javid\u2019s edict last month that GPs in England must see any patient who wants an in-person appointment.\nMarshall\u2019s letter comes as family doctors vote in an indicative ballot organised by the British Medical Association to gauge their willingness to take industrial action to oppose the plan and its accompanying performance management regime, which would \u201cname and shame\u201d practices that do not offer enough face-to-face consultations. Results of the ballot are due on 18 November.\nJavid told MPs on the committee on 2 November that \u201ca significant portion of people are turning up for emergency care when they could have actually gone to their GP.\n\u201cPart of the reason that I think people are turning up at A&E, perhaps when they do not need it, is that they are not able to get through to their primary care services in the usual way.\u201d\nHe told the MPs that \u201cI want to share with you a statistic that I am trying to recall\u201d, to prove his point. However, he then said that \u201cI will refrain from sharing the statistic\u201d, and did not indicate what the figure was, what it showed or who had produced it.\nHe was asked if he agreed with the Royal College of Emergency Medicine (RCEM), which represents A&E doctors, that lack of GP appointments had led to the increased pressure A&Es are under. Javid replied: \u201cThat general point is correct.\u201d\nMarshall further underlined his belief that the facts do not support Javid when he told the Guardian that the minister\u2019s link between access to GPs and A&E attendances \u201cis fast becoming received wisdom without scrutiny\u201d. He added: \u201cYet we are not aware of any hard data to suggest that this is the case and are asking Mr Javid for clarity about the figures he was referring to.\u201d\nThe letter also warns that 14,000 GPs could leave the profession by 2026 due to heavy workloads, stress and the government\u2019s failure to address the workforce crisis in general practice.\nJavid conceded at the select committee that the government will fail to deliver Boris Johnson\u2019s 2019 pledge of increasing GP numbers in England by 6,000 by 2024-25. The number of full-time GPs is falling and more are going part-time to improve their work/life balance.\nThe Department of Health and Social Care have been contacted for Javid\u2019s response to the letter.",

        "content": "On Neal Purvis and Robert Wade\u2019s watch, the secret agent has become a parent, grown his hair and even alluded to gay experiences. It even rains in Bond films now. But after the ending of No Time to Die, even they don\u2019t know what happens next\nWhen Neal Purvis and Robert Wade were students together in the late 1970s, they formed a band and wrote their own James Bond theme. \u201cIt was called Never Say Thunderballs Dr No,\u201d Purvis tells me. \u201cMusically, it was quite good,\u201d offers Wade. The group is still going strong, with Rat Scabies of the Damned on drums. A decade ago, they even played their Bond theme to the producer Michael G Wilson, who with his half-sister Barbara Broccoli is one of the custodians of the franchise. \u201cHe said: \u2018Don\u2019t give up your day job,\u2019\u201d Purvis shrugs. \u201cWhich I thought was a bit unnecessary.\u201d\nNot too hurtful, though, when your day job is writing James Bond movies. Purvis (60) and Wade (59), have had a hand in every instalment since The World Is Not Enough, back when Pierce Brosnan was still rocking the tuxedo. They oversaw the bare-bones Daniel Craig reboot (Casino Royale), the first Bond movie to be a direct sequel (Quantum of Solace), the death of Judi Dench as M (Skyfall), the return of arch-villain Blofeld (Spectre) and the twists and shocks of No Time to Die. This is no time for spoilers, but it is giving nothing away to reveal that Craig\u2019s swansong is not simply a Bond farewell. It\u2019s an absolute James-changer.\nIt hasn\u2019t all been plain sailing. \u201cWhen Casino Royale was released, we were introduced somewhere as the people who saved Bond,\u201d says Purvis. \u201cThey were forgetting we were also the ones who\u2019d done Die Another Day.\u201d That maligned movie, Brosnan\u2019s last in the role, has come in for no end of stick over the years, mostly for its invisible car. \u201cWe actually featured that car in every one of Daniel\u2019s Bonds,\u201d says Wade. \u201cYou just never saw it.\u201d\nWe meet in their agent\u2019s London office on the morning that No Time to Die has become the sixth-highest-grossing film in UK box-office history: it took more than \u00a387m in its opening weekend in the UK, while the global tally stands at around $667m. Not bad for a movie that was old news, its release delayed 18 months by the pandemic. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful way of feeling like we\u2019re coming out of this whole thing,\u201d says Wade, whose sandy-coloured, windblown hair and partially unbuttoned shirt make it look as if he has just stepped off a yacht. Purvis, shaven-headed and stubble-faced, wears a dark roll-neck jumper that calls to mind the Milk Tray man. The smell of expensive aftershave hangs in the air.\nThe duo, who also co-wrote one of the other top six titles (Skyfall, which took \u00a3103.2m domestically), mapped out the complete story of No Time to Die in 2017. \u201cYou\u2019re always asking yourself: \u2018What are people going to fear in a couple of years\u2019 time?\u2019 and \u2018What emotional journey can Bond go on?\u2019\u201d says Purvis. They got the fear part right. The film\u2019s villain gains control of a DNA-targeting virus, a concept first pitched for The World Is Not Enough. \u201cIf they\u2019re good ideas, they tend to stick around,\u201d says Wade.\nThey flew to New York to pitch the full outline to Craig (\u201cHe embraced it immediately,\u201d Purvis says) and to work with him on finessing it. When Danny Boyle was announced as the film\u2019s director, bringing along his regular writer John Hodge, the Purvis and Wade script was set aside; then, once Boyle and Hodge departed over creative differences, they were brought back in. Four writers are now credited on the finished movie: Purvis, Wade, its director, Cary Fukunaga, and Phoebe Waller-Bridge. Others were involved, including Scott Z Burns (Contagion, The Bourne Ultimatum), which is normal for a project of this scale. \u201cThe budgets are a million quid a page,\u201d says Wade. Purvis corrects him: \u201cA couple of million now,\u201d he says. \u201cOh yeah, it\u2019s gone up,\u201d Wade replies, as though they\u2019re discussing the price of a pint.\nHow does it feel to see their film covered in so many other fingerprints? Wade quotes Graham Greene, who likened the average screenwriter to \u201cthe only spectator who remembers what happened once \u2013 like a man who has witnessed a crime and is afraid to speak, an accomplice after the fact\u201d. Purvis echoes that: \u201cYou run your own film through your head as you\u2019re watching.\u201d This can lead to some rash responses, such as when they first saw a cut of Casino Royale. \u201cWe gave a couple of pages of notes on what they needed to fix it,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t think they took any notice. After a while, we realised it\u2019s a really good film.\u201d\nWhat surprised them about the new one? \u201cThere\u2019s no denying that what goes down very well with an audience is the whole Paloma sequence,\u201d says Purvis, referring to the delirious episode in which Bond teams up with a fizzy CIA operative played by Ana de Armas. \u201cWe had Paloma in our script, but she was just a contact. Cary wanted more, so one assumes that\u2019s an area that Phoebe dealt with.\u201d They approve wholeheartedly. \u201cIt\u2019s really fun,\u201d says Wade, \u201cand very much like a Bond movie,\u201d Purvis adds.\nThere is an emphatic female presence in the film but Wade dismisses any suggestion that this is a result of the #MeToo and Time\u2019s Up movements. \u201cI don\u2019t think we did anything differently because of that. We\u2019ve never wanted to be sexist: it doesn\u2019t look good for Bond. I\u2019ve got daughters, and I wouldn\u2019t want him not to be a good role model.\u201d Their track record bears this out. In The World Is Not Enough, they introduced the franchise\u2019s first principal female villain and positioned the central conflict as one between her and M, a shift in dynamic that was rumoured to have irritated Brosnan. (\u201cHe may have been,\u201d is all Wade will say.) The liveliest parts of Die Another Day involve Halle Berry and Rosamund Pike, while that film ends with a subversive shift to the female perspective by showing the erotic inner life of Moneypenny. Purvis and Wade also wrote a spin-off movie for Berry\u2019s character, Jinx, which was set to be directed by Stephen Frears until the studio pulled the plug.\nTheir boldness has not been confined to gender. Even as the Bourne movies began to encroach on Bond\u2019s territory \u2013 \u201cWe listen to the Bourne music quite a lot when we\u2019re writing,\u201d admits Purvis \u2013 they have kept the character fresh. On their watch, Bond has been left raggedy and long-haired in his North Korean prison cell, alluded to gay experiences, and become a parent. \u201cThe most radical gear-shift we effected was probably in Skyfall,\u201d says Wade. \u201cWhen Bond drives M to the home nobody knew about, that shifted the whole emotional register of what a Bond film could be.\u201d Not everyone was impressed. Purvis mentions an actor friend who sent congratulatory emails after Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace. \u201cWe saw him at a party and I said: \u2018You never told us what you thought of Skyfall.\u2019 He said: \u2018Wasn\u2019t a Bond movie.\u2019\u201d\nWhat he will make of No Time to Die is anybody\u2019s guess. It begins with an extended flashback to the early life of a supporting character, breaks the unspoken ban on children in Bond movies by showing two different infants in peril, and is intertwined with the four previous films in a way that is redolent of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Then there is that ending.\nHow aware are they of bending the formula to breaking point? \u201cWe\u2019ve wondered in the past whether we can get away with, for instance, voiceover,\u201d says Purvis. \u201cBut you don\u2019t want to go too far because then it ceases to be Bond.\u201d Wade is happy to have brought a ubiquitous aspect of British life to the series. \u201cIt didn\u2019t used to rain in Bond movies,\u201d he says proudly.\nAsk what is next for Bond and they are no clearer than anyone else. Decisions on Craig\u2019s replacement won\u2019t be made until next year; Purvis and Wade don\u2019t know yet whether they\u2019ll be asked back. Who needs more Bond movies anyway? \u201cI think the world would be a lesser place without him,\u201d says Purvis. Wade goes further: \u201cYou know you can rely on that guy. He\u2019s everyone\u2019s dad.\u201d Even if they don\u2019t get to write another one, there\u2019s always the band to keep them busy. \u201cWe\u2019re still hoping to make it as musicians,\u201d says Wade. \u201cThis is just what we\u2019re doing while we wait for that to happen.\u201d\n No Time to Die is on general release.",

        "content": "Chanice Alexander-Burnett stars as Fantine in the West End while 12-year-old Chanai Owusu-Ansah plays Young Nala up the road. The pair talk nerves, show tunes and homework\nIs talent inherited or something that has to be learned? Twelve-year-old Chanai Owusu-Ansah, currently playing Young Nala in the West End production of The Lion King, thinks it is a bit of both. \u201cI\u2019ve been singing and dancing with my mum for as long as I can remember,\u201d she says. \u201cMy whole life revolves around listening to music and performing.\u201d Just down the road at the Sondheim theatre, her mum, Chanice Alexander-Burnett, has the role of Fantine in Les Mis\u00e9rables, which means mother and daughter are starring in two of the biggest shows in the West End simultaneously. \u201cPeople always predicted she\u2019d follow in my footsteps. But it has some logistical challenges,\u201d Alexander-Burnett laughs.\nWe meet in one of the backrooms of the Lyceum theatre. On the evenings when her daughter is playing Nala, Alexander-Burnett has the operational task of dropping her off while also having to prepare for her own show. \u201cChanai comes home from school, gets changed, does any homework that she can, and then we both have to run to our theatres to get Covid tested for 5.30pm,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt can be very hectic.\u201d\nBoth managed to find time in their busy schedules to watch the other perform on their opening night. \u201cI cried and cried when I saw Chanai walk on stage,\u201d says her mother. \u201cI know how much she wanted it and how hard and long she\u2019d worked, so I couldn\u2019t contain my emotion. I was a mess.\u201d Owusu-Ansah set herself the goal of being part of The Lion King long before she was offered the role of Nala. In the years before her casting, she attended the show\u2019s drama academy Cub School twice a week and she has previously performed in Evita at Regent\u2019s Park Open Air theatre. \u201cEvita was my first show, so it was tiring, but it was great training. It taught me to be aware of myself in a theatre space, and how to stay focused.\u201d Young Nala features in the first half of The Lion King. Her favourite moment? Wearing a baby elephant costume for Circle of Life. \u201cThe elephant is absolutely huge, probably the size of this room! It is a really special song,\u201d she says.\nIn the leadup to starring in Les Mis, Alexander-Burnett admits she was a \u201cnervous wreck\u201d. Though she had performed in Book of Mormon and as a swing in Beautiful: The Carole King Musical, Fantine is her first lead role in the West End. \u201cI was longing for a part I could really get my teeth into,\u201d she says. \u201cSinging I Dreamed a Dream is extraordinary. I remember waiting in the wings on opening night and feeling really honoured I\u2019d been trusted with such a classic.\u201d Owusu-Ansah describes her mum as her \u201ccritic, best friend and idol\u201d. When she sees her in her costumes, \u201cI just think, oh my gosh, wow!\u201d she says. \u201cI feel so proud watching her.\u201d\nIt\u2019s \u201cmagic\u201d when she performs on stage herself, she adds. \u201cMost of the time I can\u2019t really see the audience, but when I see the outlines of people, I have to really tell myself that I can do this and that I won\u2019t mess it up. I have to properly concentrate.\u201d Alexander-Burnett\u2019s own love of performing started late. \u201cI didn\u2019t grow up in a stagey family.\u201d She enrolled for a course at London School of Musical Theatre when her daughter was a toddler. Balancing parenting with her training \u201cdid mean that Chanai always grew up around music,\u201d she says. \u201cShe\u2019s been immersed in it her entire life.\u201d\nDo they regularly get to perform together? They mention a time they sang \u201ctheir song\u201d Don\u2019t You Worry \u2019Bout a Thing (Tori Kelly\u2019s version of the Stevie Wonder song) as a duet. \u201cI think she\u2019d like to film videos and put them on Instagram or TikTok,\u201d Alexander-Burnett says. \u201cBut we probably won\u2019t get to at the moment because we are always at work!\u201d Owusu-Ansah chimes in, adding: \u201cI would love for us to be on stage together, but it might be a little bit awkward!\u201d Her mum admits: \u201cI used to want us both to be in The Lion King together. So she could be baby Nala and I could be big Nala. That would be incredible.\u201d\nOwusu-Ansah enjoys performing so much, she says, that she would \u201csleep in the theatre\u201d if she could. Still, in the future, she hopes to have a career as a lawyer. \u201cActing is my hobby, it makes me so happy and I love being around people with the same interests as me. I guess, if being a lawyer doesn\u2019t work out, I would consider it.\u201d But right now? \u201cUs both being in these two shows at the same time is a total dream.\u201d\nLes Mis\u00e9rables is at the Sondheim theatre, London, and The Lion King is at the Lyceum theatre, London.",

        "content": "New manager\u2019s first task is to sort out the defence and he must boost players who have regressed and integrate academy talent\nSteven Gerrard\u2019s most obvious and urgent task in his new job is to make sense of Aston Villa. The club have big ambitions and trumpeted a vague plan for this season \u2013 to use the money from the sale of one great individual, Jack Grealish, to improve the team as a whole. But Dean Smith was jilted, albeit quite ceremoniously, because after 11 league matches there was still a vagueness, even a confusion, to what Villa were doing. How exactly were they trying to win matches? What was their proposition? It was not easy to tell towards the end.\nIt would have been reasonable to give Smith more time to sort things out \u2013 he had solved similar problems in the past, still had the support of the players and his chances of bringing order would have been boosted once unforeseeable snags related to injuries and Covid-19 abated \u2013 but apparently the people above him concluded that a new manager was more likely to get Villa on track. Gerrard has been given a terrific opportunity to prove he can succeed in the Premier League.\nHe inherits a squad good enough to climb much higher than their current perch, 16th, though probably not strong enough to reach Europe. Villa\u2019s owners have the money to bankroll more big signings but the club have also invested heavily in their youth teams in recent years \u2013 and won the FA Youth Cup last season \u2013 and expect to see players graduate from the academy to the first team. Smith gave debuts to players such as Carney Chukwuemeka and Cameron Archer, and made the 20-year-old Jacob Ramsey a regular in midfield. Gerrard will be expected to continue integrating young players, and it was noticeable that Villa\u2019s CEO, Christian Purslow, mentioned the new manager\u2019s stint in charge of Liverpool Under-18s when announcing his appointment.\nBut the first thing Gerrard must do is repair Villa\u2019s defence. That was a job Smith accomplished in his first season after promotion, and the signing of Emi Mart\u00ednez brought even more solidity last season. But those gains have somehow got lost this season, with only Newcastle and Norwich conceding more goals. Curiously, Villa even became more vulnerable at set pieces despite hiring a specialist coach in the summer. Gerrard will be bringing a new one.\nIndividual players have gone backwards this season and Gerrard needs to reverse that. Mart\u00ednez, perhaps Villa\u2019s highest-calibre player, has been below par in a season where he has had to do an unprecedented amount of international travel; Matt Targett was outstanding last season but has regressed alarmingly; and Tyrone Mings\u2019s form deteriorated to the extent that Smith dropped him against West Ham two weeks ago. Mings has made mistakes but his personality and leadership skills, as well as the lack of a better alternative, mean he remains precious to Villa even when not at his best. Gerrard should be able to build a defence around him and Ezri Konsa.\nGerrard must also figure out how to protect that defence. Villa have not been consistently strong in central midfield. Douglas Luiz, a fine ball winner and passer when on form, has shown signs of wear after a summer in which he had no respite owing to engagements with Brazil. Marvelous Nakamba is dynamic but not much of a passer. John McGinn can be brilliant but has not performed to his best regularly. Ramsey is an emerging talent, Ashley Young a dwindling one who is certainly useful but cannot be expected to control central midfield in the Premier League very often.\nThe problem for Villa was that vulnerability in one sector seemed to infect the rest of the team. The softness of Villa\u2019s central midfield contributed to the nervousness of their defence; and the brittleness of the defence seemed to make Villa\u2019s midfield and forwards wary about pressuring opponents too high. Their pressing became haphazard and they were not solid when they sat deep. Villa looked to be caught between two stools, with the result often a mess.\nGerrard must ensure the whole team are committed to what they are doing. That probably starts with restoring confidence, which drained away with damning speed, with chronic anxiety apparently setting in after Villa let a 2-0 lead turn into a 3-2 defeat in the last 10 minutes against Wolves last month.\nThe loss of confidence probably has a lot to do with the loss of Grealish. With him, Villa\u2019s defenders, in particular, had a player to whom they could give the ball and be reassured that he would do something productive, or at least take it up the right end. Without him, Villa have often looked uncertain how to play their way forward. In mitigation, they have often been deprived of creative influences such as Bertrand Traor\u00e9 but the players available have not risen to the task consistently enough.\nEmi Buend\u00eda, the record signing in the summer, has too often been peripheral on the right wing, and Leon Bailey contributed little on his only two starts after some exciting appearances off the bench. Gerrard needs to find a way of getting much more out of those two going forward, and also decide whether, and when, they can fit into the team with both Danny Ings and the club\u2019s most dynamic player, if not the most prolific finisher, Ollie Watkins.\nThe strange thing about Villa this season is that a lot has gone wrong but it will probably not take a lot to set them right. Smith might have done it. Gerrard should.",

        "content": "Abductions are rife in the north of the country, where armed gangs target schools and colleges with apparent impunity\n\nWhen his two daughters were abducted from their university dormitories by armed men in April, Friday Sani volunteered to deliver the ransom. In two bags he carried banknotes to the value of more than 40m naira (\u00a370,000), the price to free Victory and Rejoice, and 37 others taken from the Federal College of Forestry Mechanisation in Afaka, Kaduna.\nIn April and May more than 70 students were abducted from the federal college and the nearby Greenfield University. With little faith that police could help, a group of parents went to the kidnappers, through an intermediary, and paid to get their children back.\n\u201cI personally went with the provost of the college to a location in the Giwa local government area. I held the two bags myself,\u201d Sani says. Those young people were returned. Five from the Greenfield group were killed.\nKidnapping has become endemic in northern Nigeria. Bandits \u2013 heavily armed militants, many of them ethnic Fulanis \u2013 are waging their own insurgency, killing, abducting and terrorising impoverished communities. The lawlessness has evolved from years of conflict between farmers and herders, fuelled by economic crisis, police inaction and the authorities\u2019 refusal to intervene.\nSome state governments in the north have made controversial peace deals with the bandit gangs to stop the violence but many see these agreements, widely suspected to include money, as simply incentivising criminality.\nSince the kidnapping of the Chibok schoolgirls in 2014, abductions by armed groups have become a highly lucrative crime, with ransom demands of hundreds of thousands of pounds. Children are prize targets. The groups face minimal resistance at boarding schools and universities and have grown bolder, with some kidnappers cultivating a celebrity image, making ransom demands on radio stations and granting interviews to journalists.\nAfter each kidnapping, a network of negotiators emerges, including clerics, former militants and security forces personnel. When the federal college students were kidnapped, the families sought the help of Sheikh Ahmad Gumi.\nGumi, an influential if controversial imam and government critic based in Kaduna, has close connections with the gangs and has acted as a go-between in several cases.\nThe parents say Gumi gave them contact details for former bandits who claimed to know the kidnappers. Some parents suspected the intermediaries were working with the gang, especially when ransom demands suddenly rose.\nGumi told the Guardian that his connections with the gangs did not mean he agreed with, or financially benefited from, kidnappings. \u201cParents approached me and I tried to appeal to the bandits,\u201d he says.\n\u201cMany of them [bandits] are very young and they are angry because they say they do not get justice, when farmers and some of these communities are going after them.\u201d He says the farmer-herder conflict had pushed many Fulanis to banditry. \u201cThis is difficult to hear in Nigeria but there are real grievances,\u201d he says.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way this can end without dialogue. We have to come to a settlement, or else this situation, as we are seeing it, will get much worse.\u201d\nMore than 2,000 children and young people have been abducted in Nigeria this year, according to the UN. The most recent incident was in Zamfara in September when 73 pupils were abducted from a secondary school. In July, 140 pupils at Bethel Baptist high school in Kaduna state were snatched, although 25 escaped.\nPeter Hawkins, head of the UN children\u2019s agency Unicef in Nigeria, says the insecurity is causing an education crisis, setting back gains made in pupil retention, particularly among girls.\n\u201cThere was a girls\u2019 school in Zamfara where 300 girls were kidnapped and the impact of that was the other parents saying, \u2018we\u2019re not taking kids to school.\u2019 There is really a serious crisis in education that is happening today but the impact will be over the next seven to 10 years for Nigeria,\u201d says Hawkins.\nKidnappers are becoming more brazen in their attacks, undeterred by the consequences they could face.\nThe attack on Greenfield University was led by a criminal known as \u201cSani Jalingo\u201d and often referred to as \u201cBaleri\u201d, who initially demanded 800m naira (\u00a31.4m) for their release. He is thought to have also led the kidnap at the forestry college.\nWhen the money was not forthcoming, the kidnappers killed five of the young people and then called Nasiru Adamu El-Hikaya, a presenter on the Voice of America Hausa radio station. In the call, part of which was broadcast, Jalingo boasted about the abductions, then forced some of the kidnapped students to make an appeal to their parents.\n\u201cHe called and said he\u2019s \u2018Sani Jalingo the kidnapper\u2019. He said he had something to say and had asked for my number, so I decided to record him,\u201d says Hikaya.\nOne of the students forced to appeal was Hamza Nasiru, 25. \u201cI think he was crying,\u201d Hikaya says. \u201cHe was asking for help. When you are talking from the den of kidnappers and you get an opportunity to talk to someone that can raise alarm, you will do it because your life depends on it.\u201d\nJalingo sounded \u201creckless\u201d, Hikaya says, and on a high. \u201cHe was laughing, boasting. He was comfortable in what he was doing, saying he believed he is doing the right thing, that he\u2019s even proud to be a kidnapper. He was saying the weapons they usually get could defeat the military. That they are really like the government of the forest, of the bush.\u201d\nAhmad Idris, Nasiru\u2019s uncle, was distraught. \u201cHe is almost like my own son; I felt it like as if it was my child.\u201d\nWhen, soon after the kidnap, the abductors called the students\u2019 relatives and issued their demands, some parents got in touch with the authorities; others contacted Gumi. All of the surviving students were eventually released.\nNasiru is slowly recovering from the trauma, his family says, and is waiting to continue his education. Greenfield University has relocated its campus to a more secure site in Kaduna town, while plans to move the forestry college have also reportedly been drawn up.\nMany communities affected by the kidnapping gangs have been dismayed at the lack of government support. The fact that the kidnappers are often not pursued even after ransoms have been paid has caused a lot of anger.\nIt was a struggle for Sani and the other parents to find the ransom money. Many sold all their possessions. But after the students came home, the security forces \u201cdidn\u2019t even bother to dig further to find the kidnappers\u201d, says Sani. Victory and Rejoice have not yet resumed their studies.\n\u201cIf I had my way I would move my children out of this country for education,\u201d he says. \u201cOur major concern is how our children can get back to school.\u201d\nSign up for a different view with our Global Dispatch newsletter \u2013 a roundup of our top stories from around the world, recommended reads, and thoughts from our team on key development and human rights issues, delivered to your inbox every two weeks:",

Issues include difficulty accessing childcare, and disruption to schooling because of the pandemic has led to more women continuing to work remotely.\n\u201cThere is the potential for two tracks,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s the people who are on the virtual track and people who are on the physical track. And I do worry that we will see those two tracks develop, and we will pretty much know who\u2019s going to be on which track, unfortunately.\u201d\nVincent Keaveny, the lord mayor of London, said that increasing numbers of City staff were returning to the office in the UK\u2019s financial centre.\n\u201cThe City is coming back to life,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cIt is a really important thing for younger members of the sector to get the training they need, the creativity, the collegiality that the office brings.\u201d\nKeaveny, a partner at the law firm DLA Piper, said companies should be left to set their own policies on staff returning to work and that there is not a one-size-fits-all post-pandemic model.\n\u201cI think every company is coming at this from different places,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should be telling people, telling companies, we shouldn\u2019t be micromanaging companies on an approach to this issue. But there is a very strong message that the City is open. We\u2019d love to see more people coming back.\u201d\nThe proportion of employees travelling into work has progressively increased since national restrictions were relaxed in March, rising to more than 50% in August, when a further rule change meant that those who had been double vaccinated did not have to self-isolate, according to the Office for National Statistics.\nPrevious ONS research had found that women were more likely to work from home than men because it gave them more time to work with fewer distractions.\nIn August, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, warned younger workers that they could put their careers at risk if they worked from home.\nMann was an economics professor and chief economist at Citigroup and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development before joining the Bank of England\u2019s rate-setting MPC in September.

Sources said the government hoped to show that a gap in the market left by a restriction on the trade of the controversial product could be filled by high-end chefs who are willing to produce alternatives.\nMPs have vowed to ban trade in foie gras, and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) is consulting on legislation to outlaw the sale and import of the liver-based spread. \n  Foie gras production is illegal in the UK on animal cruelty grounds, as the ducks and geese whose livers are harvested are force-fed to make it. However, top restaurants still import and sell from countries such as France.\nThe force-feeding process is known as gavage, where grain is poured into a funnel or tube that has been thrust down the bird\u2019s neck. After two weeks, the liver has swollen to many times its normal size. \n The French chef Alexis Gauthier, who runs fine-dining restaurant Gauthier Soho and plant-based restaurant 123V in Bond Street, both in London, decided to stop serving foie gras in his establishments after activists from Peta demonstrated outside and he read up on the meat and dairy trade.\nHe now serves a faux gras at his Soho venue made of mushrooms, lentils, walnuts and cognac, and says the concoction has emulated the buttery taste sought after by foie gras fans. Since this year, all the food served at his restaurants is plant-based.\nThe government has asked him for his recipe and invited him for talks with policy advisers to see if a gap in the market caused by a ban could be filled by his creation.\nAn email to vegan chefs, seen by the Guardian, says: \u201cI understand your restaurant serves an alternative to foie gras. We would appreciate the chance to arrange a virtual meeting with the chef or someone else from the team to discuss a few questions in this area. These would be questions about your views on foie gras and the challenges and opportunities associated with \u2018ethical\u2019 alternatives.\u201d\nGauthier says foie gras was once a bestselling item on his menu and that he used to sell 20kg of it a week, but claims people are now travelling from around the country to try his faux gras. He said it took patience and precision to emulate the texture, appearance and depth of the delicacy in a vegan version.\nMany luxury shops and restaurants are turning their back on foie gras, including Fortnum & Mason, which stopped selling it earlier this year.\nA government spokesperson confirmed officials were seeking meetings with those involved in creating faux gras to inform their decision on how the effects of a ban could be mitigated.\nIngredients\n1 shallot, peeled and diced\n 4 tbsp olive oil\n 4 cloves garlic, peeled and thinly sliced\n 2 tsp chopped rosemary\n 2 tsp chopped thyme\n 2 tsp chopped sage\n 24 button mushrooms, roughly sliced\n 2 tbsp cognac\n 2 tbsp soy sauce\n 400g cooked lentils\n 150g toasted walnuts\n 2 tbsp beetroot puree\n Black pepper, to taste\nMethod\nIn a heavy pan, saut\u00e9 the shallot in two tablespoonfuls of the olive oil until translucent. Add the garlic, chopped herbs, and mushrooms. Add the cognac and turn up the heat.\nAdd the soy sauce, reduce the heat, and cook over low heat for six minutes. Remove the pan from heat and let cool.\nIn a food processor, process the mushroom mixture, the remaining olive oil, the lentils, walnuts, beetroot puree and black pepper until almost smooth. Add an optional extra splash of cognac to give it that je ne sais quoi.\nPlace in a small glass jar and refrigerate for a few hours before serving. Serve alongside toasted slices of sourdough or other bread.",

        "content": "The Americans have beaten El Tri twice already this year. But this time it matters with World Cup qualifying points at stake\nIt began with a corner kick. \n  If you\u2019re looking for a starting point for the US men\u2019s national team\u2019s failure to book a spot at the 2018 World Cup, there may be no better moment than a set-piece for Mexico on 11 November 2016. \n  After four consecutive 2-0 World Cup qualifying wins over Mexico in Columbus, Ohio, the US suddenly found themselves with an unfamiliar 1-1 scoreline against their old rivals at the Mapfre Stadium.\n  Then, in the 89th minute, that corner from Miguel Lay\u00fan found the head of veteran defender Rafael M\u00e1rquez, who perfectly redirected the ball into the back of the net. The crowd of 24,000 in Columbus were stunned as Mexico not only took a 2-1 lead, but also secured their first World Cup qualifying away win against the Americans since 1972.\nThe loss to Mexico foreshadowed a dismal run against Concacaf opponents and the US failed to make the World Cup for the first time since 1986. \n Now, just one day after the five-year anniversary of that defeat, the USMNT have their chance at redemption. In a symbolic change of scenery for a new era, they\u2019ve bucked the trend of playing Mexico in Columbus with the hopes of reenergizing their efforts in a first-ever World Cup qualifier at Cincinnati\u2019s TQL Stadium on Friday night.\nLuckily for American fans, things are looking slightly rosier this time around. Although they\u2019ve had a couple of hiccups, with three wins, two draws and a loss so far, the Americans head into the match second in Concacaf qualifying (the first three teams go through to Qatar 2022 automatically with the fourth heading into an intercontinental playoff).\nThis isn\u2019t the same roster that couldn\u2019t get the job done a few years back either. From the current call-up, only two players (Christian Pulisic and DeAndre Yedlin) were part of the squad that stumbled in November 2016. And through that process and transition, they\u2019ve also beaten Mexico twice this year in the finals of the Concacaf Nations League and Gold Cup.\nThat said, World Cup qualification remains their most significant goal in mind, and neither team was at full strength for the previous two games which took place in what amount to glorified friendly tournaments. \n  \u201c[The Gold Cup and Nations League] mean absolutely nothing,\u201d said Tyler Adams in an interview on CBS Sports\u2019 Que Golazo podcast earlier this week. \u201cThe only good thing about those games is that we continue to progress in those points in time.\u201d\n  He added: \u201cThis is for a World Cup, the motivation will be completely different.\u201d\n  USMNT manager Gregg Berhalter also recognizes the gravity of Friday\u2019s game.\n  \u201cIn the context of World Cup qualifying, it\u2019s just another game, right? But in terms of the rivalry and the history and the times when you get to play them with a pro-US crowd in a great stadium, I mean, it makes it special,\u201d Berhalter told the Cincinnati Enquirer.\nBut can Mexico once again steal the show on American soil? Mexico are unbeaten in their six qualifying games, with four wins and two draws, and sit top of the table, three points clear of the US.\n  Despite all of this, regional bragging rights have remained out of reach for Mexico after losing the Gold Cup and Nations League finals to the US. \n  During the 3-2 Nations League final loss to the United States, Mexico fell victim to two goals off corners. Months later in the Gold Cup final, it was a set-piece goal in extra time that secured a narrow 1-0 victory over Mexico. \n  \u201cIt is true that we lost two finals, but the United States [hurt us] from set-pieces,\u201d said Mexico coach Tata Martino after the Gold Cup defeat in August. \u201cWe had great moments in the two finals where we defined the game. When we cannot convert goals from these situations, there is always a risk.\u201d\n  For Mexico on Friday, capitalizing on those situations will be paramount as they aim to steal back the crown as the kings of the Concacaf region. Regardless of the two painful losses to the US in 2021, an away win in a World Cup qualifier would do plenty to help heal the wounds. \n  As for the young US team, they have an opportunity to not only take a huge step towards a return to the World Cup, but to also truly claim their dominance in the region with a historic third consecutive victory over Mexico within just six months. \n  Either way, keep an eye out for those set-pieces once the game kicks off.",

        "content": "Hamaguchi\u2019s award-winning and absorbing new movie Drive My Car deals with issues of grief and infidelity \u2013 and reflects his artistic journey towards inner truths\nAfter the 2011 earthquake in Japan, Ry\u016bsuke Hamaguchi was commissioned to make a documentary about the impact on the north-eastern T\u014dhoku region. He spent hours driving every day with his co-director, and realised how cars take you places in more ways than one. \u201cThe two of us aren\u2019t really communicative with each other in general,\u201d he says. \u201cBut in the car, we talked more than we did before. In a car, visually you\u2019re satisfied \u2013 you\u2019ve got information from the scenery from the windows. But sonically you only get the engine revving and that\u2019s pretty much it. So I think we tend to want to fill that void.\u201d\nThis in-transit intimacy exerts its mysterious pull in Hamaguchi\u2019s new movie, Drive My Car, which is adapted from a short story by Haruki Murakami. It is about Kafuku, a widowed theatre director who reluctantly accepts a female chauffeur, Misaki, while he oversees a new production of Uncle Vanya. As his red Saab 900 winds its way to work, he listens to a cassette of his dead wife reciting lines of Chekhov, and begins to open up to his driver about his grief and her infidelity.\nTaking the scenic route over three hours, observing how Kafuku\u2019s art is drawn into the slipstream of his life, the film is so enigmatic and absorbing that \u2013 like Misaki\u2019s ultra-smooth driving \u2013 the gear-changes into the philosophical fast lane are hardly noticeable. Winning three awards at Cannes this year, including best screenplay, Drive My Car confirmed that Hamaguchi (to nab another Beatles title) now had a ticket to ride in the auteur big league.\nMurakami\u2019s story was originally published in 2014, part of the Men Without Women collection \u2013 though Hamaguchi had no contact with the Japanese literary giant beyond permission to proceed. The story uses driving as a metaphor for how other forms of conveyance \u2013 sexual desire, role-playing and ultimately storytelling \u2013 sweep us despite ourselves towards inner truths. \u201cThe lines in a script are actually a vehicle, and they carry on regardless of what the actor thinks about them. So they\u2019re probably closer to a train than a car,\u201d he says through a translator in a video call from his home city of Yokohama. He continues: \u201cBut they\u2019re driving the actors in a positive way. It\u2019s being able to express something you can\u2019t materialise in real life through a fiction.\u201d\nOne insight into Hamaguchi\u2019s working methods is the mind-numbingly repetitive rehearsal process Kafuku subjects his cast to in the film, a version of how the real-life director also works. His idea is that drumming in the lines without emotion allows actors to fully internalise the text, the better to access authentic emotions in them later.\nDrive My Car\u2019s production circumstances seemed to have embedded a similar truth-seeking drill into Hamaguchi, too. Shortly after shooting on the Tokyo-set prologue had begun in early 2020, the pandemic hit and production was shut down for eight months. They had to relocate the main part of the story from Busan in South Korea to Hiroshima, because of foreign-travel restrictions. So Hamaguchi \u2013 \u201cgrateful\u201d for the extra time \u2013 finished off a quick-sketch anthology film Wheel of Fortune and Fantasy, that was in part a dress rehearsal for the larger work: an extended car journey opens the first section, about a model who discovers her booker is dating her ex; role-playing is a revelatory gateway in the second and third.\nHamaguchi had an itinerant childhood: born in Kanagawa prefecture, just south of Tokyo, he moved around due to his civil servant father\u2019s frequent postings. \u201cWhenever I get asked where I\u2019m from, I don\u2019t really know what to say.\u201d He was a typical video game-and manga-loving teenager before access to Tokyo\u2019s glut of arthouse cinemas while at university broadened his tastes. He was especially drawn to John Cassavetes, whom Hamaguchi has praised for his ability to depict people at breaking point. Later, doing a film degree \u2013 studying partly under cerebral horror maestro Kiyoshi Kurosawa \u2013 Hamaguchi found kinship with older traditions. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t find anything interesting in contemporary Japanese cinema, apart from a very few directors,\u201d he says, sipping tea. \u201cBut then I started watching Japanese classic movies and I found how much richer cinema was back then. A national heritage that we can be proud of as a culture.\u201d\nHis 2012 earthquake and tsunami documentary The Sound of Waves \u2013 and its two follow-ups \u2013 was a crucial breakthrough, he says. Being forced to forget about scripts and react simply to what he shot brought new freshness to his work. \u201cI learned how to use the camera correctly, which is to bring out the power of reality. Who the subjects are as people, as individuals. I wanted to break down these brackets and show these people as individuals, not just random people who suffered from disaster. Now I reflect that in my [fictional] movies by trying to bring out as optimally as possible what the actors can express.\u201d\nDrive My Car \u2013 a transition from skittish, ironic melodramas such as Asako I & II into something with a cool, serene depth \u2013 shows this new concentration. But art only ever has truth in the passenger seat because its journey has a fixed destination, Hamaguchi reminds us. \u201cA story has to end, right? And everyone, including the creators and the audience, knows it\u2019s a lie. But because of that limitation, we can be honest in that fiction.\u201d\n This article was amended on 12 November 2021 to correct the spelling of T\u014dhoku.\n Drive My Car is released in cinemas on 19 November, when the Close-Up Cinema\u2019s Ry\u016bsuke Hamaguchi retrospective also begins as part of its Japan 2021 season. Wheel of Fortune and Fantasy will be released on 11 February 2022.",

Plus, how gerrymandering rigs elections\nGood morning.\nDonald Trump has succeeded in an 11th-hour attempt to temporarily stay the release of sensitive White House records on the US Capitol attack.\nWashington DC\u2019s federal appeals court on Thursday granted Trump\u2019s request to temporarily stop the National Archives from handing over the records to the bipartisan House select committee that is investigating the 6 January insurrection.\nAfter the US district judge Tanya Chutkan\u2019s ruling that the former president could not claim executive privilege over the documents, Trump was granted a temporary injunction.\nWhat is Trump doing? Delaying. The Democrat-led committee may have to finish its investigation before next year\u2019s midterms, in which Republicans are tipped to take control of the US House.\nWhen is the hearing? The court will hear oral arguments on 30 November.\nWho are the judges? The DC circuit court chooses three judges at random to consider the appeal: it will be Patricia Millett, Robert Wilkins and Ketanji Brown Jackson.\nThe US has failed to commit to some of Cop26\u2019s toughest climate pledges, with its signature noticeably absent on promises to phase out coalmining, to end the use of internal combustion engines and to compensate poorer countries.\nThis is despite the Biden administration proclaiming the US\u2019s status as a climate leader and underlining its willingness to undo the damage caused by the previous administration. It comes as Democrats express confidence that their pared-down $1.75tn spending bill, which contains landmark climate measures, will clear Congress next week.\nThe weakness of the proposed targets agreed at the climate summit means leaders will have to renegotiate next year, the three architects of the Paris agreement said. Current national plans would lead to 2.4C of heating, according to analysis by Climate Action Tracker \u2013 a far cry from 1.5C.\nHow many committed to phasing out coalmining? More than 40 countries signed up to the pledge, excluding the US, China and India. The latter two combined burn about two-thirds of the world\u2019s coal, and the US still generates about a fifth of its electricity from it.\nMeanwhile, delegates from countries where the climate emergency is already \u201can everyday reality\u201d have spoken about how they are affected by anxiety over the looming disaster.\nBefore next year\u2019s midterms, politicians are undertaking the once-a-decade process of editing the nation\u2019s political maps: the \u201cinvisible scalpel\u201d known as gerrymandering that shapes the terrain and tenor of US politics.\nThe US is almost unique in allowing partisan lawmakers to redraw maps for their own advantage. This year Republicans can redraw the lines of 187 congressional districts, while Democrats can do so in 75.\nHere are four maps showing the key ways that Republicans will seek to increase their chances of winning back the US House next November:\nDismantling a Democratic district.\nDiluting the influence of Black voters.\nWeakening diverse suburbs.\nRegrouping Democrats voters into non-competitive districts.\nThe judge presiding over Kyle Rittenhouse\u2019s homicide trial has been thrust into the spotlight after he admonished prosecutors and his phone was heard ringing with a song played at Donald Trump\u2019s rallies. Wisconsin\u2019s longest-serving circuit judge, Bruce Schroeder, also queried the veracity of iPad footage ahead of the defense resting its case.\nNetflix has cut a Latina housekeeper character from its upcoming series Uncoupled, starring Neil Patrick Harris, after a veteran actor described the characterization as \u201churtful and derogatory\u201d. Ada Maris wrote an open letter expressing offense at the stereotypes reinforced by the role.\nThe US and European delegations on the UN security council have called for action against Belarus, condemning Minsk for endangering migrants \u201cfor political purposes\u201d. Poland says Belarus has lured 2,000 migrants in order to send them over its border in revenge for EU sanctions.\nThe American journalist Danny Fenster has been jailed for 11 years in Myanmar after being convicted on a range of charges previously described by the US government as \u201cprofoundly unjust\u201d.\nAstraZeneca is set to move to \u201cmodest profitability\u201d after selling more than $2.2bn of its Covid-19 vaccine in the first nine months of this year. The drugmaker has committed to providing the shot on a not-for-profit basis during the pandemic so far, and sales in the year\u2019s final three months \u201care expected to be a blend of the original pandemic agreements and new orders\u201d, it said.\nTwenty-five years on from their debut album, Placebo are back. On the band\u2019s eighth studio album, singer Brian Molko \u2013 who \u201ccultivated a gendered and sexual expansiveness\u201d decades before the term \u201cnon-binary\u201d became commonly used \u2013 turns his attention to climate disaster and surveillance culture.

Or, as Sasha Geffen puts it, \u201chow we hold each other through the ruin\u201d.\nGermany\u2019s leading Angela Merkel impersonator, Ursula Wanecki, is pretty much the chancellor\u2019s spitting image. But after 16 years as Merkel\u2019s double, Wanecki says she will hang up the blazers when the 67-year-old retires next month.

        "content": "Who pays for \u2018loss and damage\u2019 is in vogue at Cop26, but the authors of the climate emergency are still escaping accountability\nMohammed Nasheed made global headlines in 2009 by convening the world\u2019s first underwater cabinet meeting. As president of the Maldives, a nation of 1,138 low-lying islands south-west of India, Nasheed donned scuba gear and descended beneath the waves with 13 government ministers. The officials used waterproof pencils to sign a document urging the world to slash carbon dioxide emissions so the Maldives would not disappear beneath rising seas.\n\u201cIf the Maldives cannot be saved today, we do not feel that there is much of a chance for the rest of the world,\u201d Nasheed told reporters.\nToday, Nasheed is the speaker of parliament in the Maldives and the global south\u2019s ambassador to the Cop26 climate conference. He continues to warn that anything more than 1.5C of global warming \u201cis a death sentence\u201d for his country and other low-lying regions around the world. To illustrate what the last 12 years of rising temperatures have brought, he recalls the lagoon where he held that famous underwater cabinet meeting.\n\u201cIf you go to the same spot [today], you will see the reef is far more dead, bleached, than it was,\u201d Nasheed said in Glasgow this week. Dead reefs lead to coastal erosion, which wipes out homes and schools and contaminates freshwater sources; the Maldives now spends 30% of its government budget adapting to climate change, including vast sums to desalinate water, he added.\nThese are some of the human realities behind \u201closs and damage,\u201d a phrase suddenly in vogue at this week\u2019s Cop26 UN climate conference. It refers to irreversible harms that result from the higher global temperatures caused by burning fossil fuels and related human activities. The dead reefs of the Maldives, for example, will never come back to life as long as oceans are so hot \u2013 they will remain bleached for decades to come, even if countries manage to limit temperature rise to 1.5C.\nIt\u2019s scandalous it has taken so long for global climate negotiations to acknowledge the reality of \u201closs and damage\u201d. Worse yet, even now, Cop26 proceedings are not calling on the main authors of the climate emergency \u2013 ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell, BP, and other fossil fuel companies \u2013 to pay for the immense human suffering and economic harm they have caused.\n\u201cThe principle is easy enough: these companies have to admit they are responsible for loss and damage, and they should pay for it,\u201d said Saleemul Huq, the director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development in Bangladesh.\nThe formal absence of calls for compensation from fossil fuel companies is not surprising at Cop26; a first draft of the conference\u2019s agreement did not even include the words \u201cfossil fuels\u201d (though a later draft does reference the need to phase out coal and subsidies for fossil fuels). Instead, Cop26\u2019s discussion assumes governments of wealthy countries will cover the costs. Here, too, the reasoning is straightforward: rich countries have emitted the vast majority of the gases overheating the planet, so they should pay for the resulting harm.\nPaying for loss and damage, however, is not a proposition most rich country governments have embraced. Scotland is a shining exception: Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, announced on Thursday that Scotland will provide \u00a33m for loss and damage, an example she urged other nations to follow. Meanwhile, rich countries are still lagging on a related obligation they have accepted: providing poorer countries $100bn a year to shift to clean energy and adapt to worsening impacts.\nBut adaptation is distinct from loss and damage. \u201cAdaptation is what people do to protect themselves,\u201d for example, desalinating water, said Simon Anderson of the International Institute for Environment and Development. \u201cLoss and damage is what happens to people, with or without adaptation.\u201d\nAs the Climate Vulnerable Forum\u2019s ambassador to Cop26, Nasheed says loss and damage could determine the conference\u2019s success or failure. \u201cI call on the companies to pay for the damage that\u2019s been done, and for governments to make them pay,\u201d he said of the fossil fuel industry. \u201cUnless they do that, it will be tough to get the confidence of vulnerable countries that these talks are meaningful.\u201d\nIn a just world, the executives of fossil fuel companies would have to change places with people in the Maldives and experience how it feels to lose the reefs that protect their homes, schools, fresh water, and what Nasheed called \u201c2,000 years of culture\u201d. Short of that, doesn\u2019t simple morality demand that the companies pay for the massive loss and damage they have wrought?\nThis story is published as part of Covering Climate Now, a global collaboration of news outlets strengthening coverage of the climate story.

        "content": "They are film and television\u2019s unsung heroes: the people who create sounds, for everything from crunchy snow, kissing and horses\u2019 hooves. Just don\u2019t mention coconuts\nMonday morning in the small Essex town of Coggeshall, and in an unassuming building that used to be a laundry, a man named Barnaby is trying to sound like a horse. Trying and succeeding, uncannily. Not neighing or whinnying, just making the sound of the hooves on the ground.\nIn a big screen on the wall of a windowless room is an armoured knight astride a white warhorse. It\u2019s Richard III, as it happens, accompanied by a gaggle of guards, also armoured and mounted. It\u2019s a scene from The Lost King, Stephen Frears\u2019s upcoming film about the woman who, after 30 years of looking, discovered Richard\u2019s remains under a Leicester car park.\nBarnaby \u2013 Barnaby Smyth \u2013 squats in front of the screen, staring intently at it. In front of him on the floor is a square of compacted earth with a microphone pointed at it, like a heron waiting to strike. Smyth has got some vegetation handy, a few vines and autumnal leaves, but he has pushed it to the side; he doesn\u2019t need it for this scene, just the hard ground. In each hand he has spindles from the centre of rolls of old 35mm movie film, wrapped in gaffer tape.\nWhen, on the screen, King Richard turns his white courser and moves off, Barnaby hits the earth with his spindles exactly in sync with the hooves, first at an accelerating walk, then a little stumble into a canter before settling into a rhythmic gallop. Ignoring Barnaby and watching the screen, you would swear you were hearing a heavy horse galloping off across Bosworth Field, in 1485. It\u2019s perfect; the only disappointment is that Smyth is not using coconuts to make it. \u201cCoconuts can be a bit hollow-sounding,\u201d he says. \u201cThese are just more \u2026\u201d and he hits the ground with them again. More like the sound of a galloping horse, clearly.\nWelcome to the weird and rather wonderful world of foley. Named after Jack Donovan Foley, who pioneered many of the techniques in the 1920s, foley is the addition of everyday sound effects to film or television in post-production \u2013 incidental sounds such as the squeak of a chair, the chink of bottles in a fridge door, the swish of clothes or a swinging handbag. And footsteps, lots of footsteps, both human and non-human. \u201cIt steers the narrative, where to look, how to feel,\u201d Smyth says. \u201cFoley adds that focus to draw the attention of the audience.\u201d\nFeet First Sound is a foley studio, and Barnaby Smyth is a foley artist and supervisor. Keith Partridge \u2013 headphoned and sitting at a big mixing desk at the back of the room \u2013 is a foley engineer. Basically, Smyth makes noises and Partridge records them and fiddles with them to make them better.\nThe room is an odd mix: part hi-tech modern recording studio, part junk shop. There are trays and trolleys of bottles and glasses for chinking and rattling, books and pens (although if Smyth wants to make the noise of a really nice fountain pen, he\u2019ll often use a bicycle tyre pressure gauge, which sounds heavier and classier and actually more pen-like).\nAnd there are shoes, shelf upon shelf, hundreds of them. This smart pair of brogues Smyth wore to add to Gary Oldman\u2019s steps as Churchill in Darkest Hour. They recorded in Churchill\u2019s War Rooms in Westminster, for added authenticity, as well as here in the studio. And these dowdy, black, size 10 heels are the ones he wore to dub the hurrying typists in the same film, as well as scurrying servants in Downton Abbey. A big pair of army boots? Nazis, naturally \u2013 in the BBC drama World on Fire, also the movies Suite Fran\u00e7aise and The Aftermath; they do a lot of Nazis.\nIf this room is a junk shop, then the one next door is full-on car boot sale \u2013 a huge space, jam-packed full of pretty much everything. There are banks of drawers labelled \u201cmedical\u201d, \u201cbelts\u201d, \u201csports\u201d, \u201cpolice\u201d, \u201cbones\u201d, \u201cmakeup\u201d, \u201cgloves\u201d. He shows me how he makes the sound of a pigeons flying away by flapping a pair of leather gloves together. He did it for a recent episode of Baptiste. There are crates filled with different kinds of ground to walk on: leaves, bark, forest soil, mossy soil. Smyth shows me how to make the noise of boot on snow by twisting a pillowcase full of cornflour. You want scrunchier, more compact snow? Add dishwasher salt.\nOn the wall are real weapons: decommissioned rifles and machine guns, swords, axes (\u201cWe\u2019re all set for the zombie apocalypse,\u201d he says, cheerfully). On the floor are piles of old tech: telephones, keyboards, the ZX Spectrum used in Charlie Brooker\u2019s Black Mirror: Bandersnatch. It\u2019s Marie Kondo\u2019s worst nightmare: nothing gets thrown away. Even the cardboard packaging that the mixing desk came in was kept. With a rubber mat on top, it made the sound of the gym floor in the boxing film Journeyman. For the punches, Smyth held a microphone in his mouth and hit himself in the stomach.\nPeriod drama is peak foley. \u201cIt\u2019s great in terms of sound: there\u2019s so much to get our teeth into in those creaky environments.\u201d They do sometimes get to come out of the studio, to record in real stately homes. Fantasy is fun, too. They\u2019ve just finished doing a series called The Wheel of Time, an adaptation of Robert Jordan\u2019s epic novels, which Amazon is hoping will be the next Game of Thrones. Lots of armour, blood and guts.\nDo they do much with watermelons? \u201cThere is this presumption that we spend all day smashing up watermelons,\u201d Smyth says. But yes, they have been known to. There was a film called The Upside of Anger that had a shocking exploding-head scene and they smashed up a watermelon for that. \u201cAll the gloopy bits are brilliant for the sound of bits of brain hitting the floor and the wall. If you really need to up the ante you can get a pomegranate, slice it in half and gorge out the innards; it sounds like flesh, gooey with a bit of sinew in there. And celery is like bone crunching.\u201d\nThey make happier noises of the flesh, too. Smyth kisses the back of his own hand. \u201cYou get into the mood, I\u2019m kissing whoever is on screen, I\u2019ve got to think about the angle and whether I\u2019m kissing the neck or whatever.\u201d\nAnd it sometimes goes beyond kissing. They did a series called The Great, with Elle Fanning as Empress Catherine II and Nicholas Hoult as the Emperor Peter III, who were at it a lot. Smyth slaps his own upper arms rhythmically to give a flavour. \u201cIt\u2019s just a job, I\u2019m doing a sex scene. You break it down \u2013 I\u2019m going to do the skin, I\u2019m going to do the sheets \u2013 it\u2019s an unremarkable thing.\u201d\nRight, quite enough of that. Time to get back to work, and to Bosworth in 1485. There\u2019s still plenty of foley to add to the scene. After doing Richard\u2019s horse, Smyth and Partridge need to go back through the scene several times to add the sounds of armour and reins, plus those of the other knights on the screen, their horses and standards. For the armour, Smyth wears a gauntlet (eBay, \u00a318) which he rubs against his chain mail (an old butcher\u2019s apron), while his other hand shakes Partridge\u2019s favourite prop of all, a folding metal steamer basket. Again, he does this perfectly in time with Richard\u2019s riding movements.\nNow there are more hooves to add. It can\u2019t be that hard; I need to have a go. I\u2019ll do the hooves of one of the other horses, while Smyth does some armour jangling. I\u2019m hitting the earth with the gaffer-taped discs, trying to keep in time with the horse on the screen. I\u2019m thinking it sounds pretty good, perhaps a tiny bit uneven, but maybe I\u2019ll get to go to the premiere, or get a credit at least \u2026 \u201cNot for that horse you don\u2019t,\u201d Partridge says from his desk, \u201cthat drunk horse.\u201d Smyth jumps aboard the mockery wagon. \u201cA crazed horse, with BSE, just before it\u2019s shot \u2026\u201d\nYeah, all right, I was only trying to help. I\u2019m not sure horses even get BSE. But it\u2019s possible my horse won\u2019t make the final cut. Smyth and Partridge don\u2019t get to go to a lot of premieres, anyway. They just send off what they\u2019ve done and the director and the sound director pick and choose what they want of it.\nAs for the viewing public, they are mostly unaware that foley even exists; that there are people like Barnaby Smyth and Keith Partridge out there, smashing up watermelons. That\u2019s OK with Smyth. \u201cNot to be noticed is really the biggest compliment we can have.\u201d",

        "content": "The measure could curb the wind-driven wildfires in the region, but critics want a deeper assessment\n\u201cThat tree is dead. That tree is dead \u2013 we are too late for them,\u201d Greg Thomson, the forester for Los Padres national forest says, as he traipses through a dense patch of conifers clustered on a peak overlooking Ventura county. Pine needles and yellowed grass crunch beneath his boots as he points to giant spiny tree skeletons with thick trunks.\nThese trees, he says, were victims of the drought, beetle infestations and a changing climate on an overgrown landscape that has not seen a good fire in too long \u2013 and it\u2019s his job to do something about that.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a lot of forest out here and I don\u2019t want to lose it all on my watch,\u201d he says. \u201cOur number one goal in Los Padres is to keep the forest here.\u201d\nThat\u2019s why the US forest service has approved a controversial plan to cull smaller trees from the area and carve a cleared line spanning more than 700 acres across the mountaintop. The \u201cshaded fuel break\u201d, a reduced mosaic of vegetation, will, according to officials, give firefighters a designated clearing to slow or stop flames at the ridge and remove the \u201cfuel\u201d that drives the most dangerous blazes.\nForest officials say it\u2019s a strategy that will enable them to protect forest health, safeguard the habitats of threatened animals and slow the onslaught of wildfires.\nBut the Pine Mountain project has sharply divided officials, environmental activists, and locals. A coalition of advocacy organizations, including the Los Padres Forest Watch, the Centers for Biological Diversity, and the Wishtoyo Chumash Foundation, have rallied support from local city councils, county supervisors and local businesses against the proposal, citing concerns over its approval process and the potential to harm ecosystems.\nThere\u2019s strong scientific consensus that, in crowded forests, treatments that remove overgrown vegetation are essential \u2013 the federal government, which manages roughly 57% of California\u2019s forests, has also faced criticism that agencies are abysmally behind on using the treatments.\nControlled fires make space for trees to thrive, and they can\u2019t be lit until the excess vegetation \u2013 referred to as \u201cfuel\u201d by officials and researchers \u2013 is cleared. When dense underbrush dies or dries, it feeds high-intensity wildfires that are difficult to contain and more likely to leave behind charred moonscapes that take a heavy toll on habitats and ecosystems. If the underbrush is not cleared, it can easily cause prescribed burns to rage out of control, much like the infernos they are supposed to stop.\nOnly a tiny fraction of the roughly 33m acres of California\u2019s forests are treated each year, and scientists are clear that more thinning and prescribed burning is needed. With hot, dry days stretching fire weather longer each year, the window for conducting treatments is getting smaller. Some projects have faced long delays, tied up in legal battles with a vocal contingent of environmental advocates. This fiscal year the forest service completed only half the fuel treatments it had planned in California and according to scientists, that\u2019s a big problem.\n\u201cThere is no controversy among scientists on this at all. In the Sierra Nevada, fuel treatments, thinning and prescribed fire are absolutely essential,\u201d says John Battles, a forest ecologist and professor at University of California Berkeley.\nBut the landscapes across these ridges of Los Padres are decidedly different from the forests in northern California and the Sierra Nevada. What works in the northern forests may not be what\u2019s needed in the south, where fires are often driven by dry winds. \u201cThere the science on the efficacy of treatments is much more ambiguous\u201d, Battles adds. \u201cIt is a legitimate concern of how much value is there.\u201d\nRising roughly 7,000ft above the sprawling hillsides north of the town of Ojai, there\u2019s a rich tapestry of colorful tufts coating the slopes. Sage, chamise, and scrub oak sprawl across the horizon \u2013 the vibrant yellows and greens of the coastal chaparral on full display. Nearly half the proposed fire break project will cut into these systems, which may not fare as well from the intervention.\nDespite the opposition, the forest service has pushed forward with the Pine Mountain project. Thomson is quick to note that the largest trees will remain unless they pose a threat to roads or campsites. Those with a circumference between 18 and 24 inches are the main targets, and will be strategically culled.\nThe proposed fire break is far from the nearest town \u2013 which has sparked questions about its relevance. But Thomson says it is intended to stop or slow flames from reaching the sensitive habitats of threatened animals, including the spotted owl and California condor.\nSituated between wilderness areas but with rare road access, the fire break will also enable the agency to manage and protect the land far beyond the project perimeter.\nHowever, ecological sacrifices will be made. Native plants will be pulled from the ground. Trees that provide habitat for various plant and animal species will be taken off the land.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a tradeoff with everything\u201d, says Nicole Molinari, an ecologist with the US forest service. \u201cWhen I think about these forest health projects, there may be some short term impacts for a huge, long term gain,\u201d she adds. \u201cIf these forests are lost to beetle mortality or drought or high severity fire, they could be gone forever.\u201d\nThe forest service is prepared to cut through hundreds of acres of chaparral \u2013 and the rich and diverse ecosystems this shrubland supports \u2013 to protect the trees above.\n\u201cBushes are second-class citizens compared to trees,\u201d says ecologist Brad Shaffer, director of the UCLA La Kretz Center for California Conservation Science, noting that fire effects on this system are understudied, compared with the northern forests. Shaffer, who is studying how ecosystems recoveredafter the Woolsey fire, which torched the chaparral-covered mountains in Los Angeles and Ventura counties in 2018, said it largely comes down to public perception.\n\u201cEverybody says I want to go for a walk in the woods, not a walk in the bushes,\u201d he says, which might be undercutting the need for a unique approach to preserving and protecting very different landscapes. \u201cManaging fire in dry, western conifer forest is just a very different issue than managing it in very fire-prone chaparral and oak woodland.\u201d\nChaparral burns differently and recovers differently after a fire, which is why it is defined by a different \u201cfire regime\u201d \u2013 a way of classifying landscapes and how often they were set ablaze historically. Fires that torch the coastal shrublands are naturally low in frequency but high in severity.\n\u201cChaparral has a high-intensity, crown fire regime, meaning when a fire burns, it burns everything, frequently leaving behind an ashen landscape,\u201d according to a report from the the California Chaparral Institute, a non-profit organization formed to protect the diverse native vegetation system. The group is one of those opposed to the USFS treatment plan.\nWhile northern California forests have suffered from suppression policies that delivered too few fires, landscapes in the south have been harmed by the reverse \u2013 the high fire frequency left environmental degradation in its wake. Since fires in this region are more often wind-driven than fuel-driven, thinning does less to slow them down.\nResearch by forest service officials confirms as much.\n\u201cIt is not easy to align fuel treatment goals in this vegetation with restoration goals \u2013 in fact, you really can\u2019t do it,\u201d said USFS ecologist Hugh Safford during a presentation given at the California chaparral symposium in 2018.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t be doing it,\u201d he said, noting that sometimes the only way to protect natural habitats at risk from frequent fire is through the tactical use of these treatments. \u201cFrom the ecological viewpoint\u201d, he says, the strategy \u201cneeds to be understood as a local resource sacrifice made in order to gain a benefit at the landscape scale\u201d.\nClose to half of the project\u2019s perimeter \u2013 314 acres \u2013 is covered in chaparral, and environmental advocates opposing the plan say it will do more to harm than help.\n\u201cThey have a blanket, one-size-fits-all approach to how to deal with wildfire, and that\u2019s problematic from an ecological perspective,\u201d says Bryant Baker, the conservation director with Los Padres Forest Watch.\nHe advocates for a more hands-off approach, even if that means letting the landscapes as they are now go. \u201cForests are not museums,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are not places where nothing changes over time. They are very dynamic. Trees live and they die and dead trees offer up a completely new habitat.\u201d Standing dead trees, called snags, are quickly put to use by insects, woodpeckers, chipmunks, and other small creatures, he says.\nBaker and other critics are concerned that human intervention will lead to even more losses. Walking through the project perimeter, Bryant falls to his knees, unearthing yellowed cheatgrass, an invasive species spotting the ground. It\u2019s far more flammable than native species, increasing the risks of flashy, fast-moving flames. \u201cThe non-native grass is already here and all it needs is more disturbance to spread across this ridge line,\u201d he says.\nThe forest service claims these issues were considered, but the proposal was approved under \u201ccategorical exclusion\u201d, a USFS designation that enables federal managers to move forward without the need for a detailed environmental analysis.\nCritics of the plan believe a deeper assessment is required. Thousands of public comments were submitted in opposition to the project before it was approved at the end of September. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife expressed concerns, citing the \u201chigh biological diversity\u201d in the project area.\nThe Coastal Band of the Chumash Nation has also criticized the plan, citing the potential for cultural degradation. \u201cThese are public lands, these are sacred lands to us, they should be working with us,\u201d says Mariza Sullivan, tribal chair of the Coastal Band of the Chumash Nation. \u201cThere is a legacy of institutional paternalism that leaves all of us with a desert instead of a garden.\u201d\nThe USFS says that it consulted with the US fish and wildlife service to address possible biological and ecological impacts and with federally recognized tribes on the cultural impacts to these sacred sites. Thomson says the agency is open to hearing more feedback but insists the public\u2019s fears have been placated.\nThere are also concerns that, under the guise of restoration, the USFS is green-lighting a logging project and opening the cherished area to industry interests. \u201cThe cost is on the taxpayer to do this work,\u201d says the USFS ecologist Molinari. \u201cIf we can offset some of that cost by having a group who can actually benefit from the material come and remove it from the landscape \u2013 that\u2019s a win-win.\u201d\nThomson thinks the directive is clear. The USFS is supposed to manage the land, he says, as a valuable asset for the American people. He cares most about those trees at the top and is determined to save them. Comparing the roughly 750 acres to the burn scar of the Dixie fire that blackened close to a million acres this year, he sees this as a small sacrifice with the potential to stop a severe fire from reaching these trees.\nStepping close to the edge of the steep slope, Thomson picks up a pinecone from the forest floor. \u201cIf we can protect some of the stands on the ridge top and maintain that seed source, nature has a chance to come back,\u201d he says, tossing the pinecone from the ledge. As it bounces quietly out of view he smiles: it\u2019s distributing its seeds down below. \u201cBut if we lose all those trees and the seed source \u2013 we are out of luck.\u201d",

This year, a number of food retailers pulled the 10p bags from their stores after learning that most ended up in the bin, with the average household getting through 50 a year.\nHindmarch\u2019s solution is an oversized tote bag with a smiley face logo and racer-style straps. It is burgundy to reflect Sainsbury\u2019s signature colour, and will be available in racing green when it goes on sale in Waitrose in January. The designer, who said the project was about \u201ceco not ego\u201d, is in talks to launch the bag at other supermarket chains too.\nCertainly, it would look more at home on the shelves of one of Hindmarch\u2019s boutiques, where the going rate for a handbag is \u00a3900, than among the Graze boxes and marked-down mangos. But it is the substance and not the style of this accessory that Hindmarch hopes will set it apart from other bags under your sink.\nThe bag is made from recycled plastic and is fully recyclable, with minimum effort required \u2013 a built-in pocket acts as a pre-addressed envelope, allowing the bag to be placed in any letterbox when the user is ready to part with it.\nIt is designed to withstand 10 years of hard labour. \u201cYou can get your week\u2019s shopping in it and schlep and lug but you can also put it down in a puddle while you wait for a bus,\u201d says the designer.\nAs the landfill situation worsens in the UK, critics of the fashion industry will question the need for another mass-market fashion item. But Hindmarch, a savvy businesswoman and UK trade ambassador, as well as an environmentalist, believes incremental improvements are crucial.\n\u201cWe\u2019re never going to get away from needing bags because we need to move things from one place to another,\u201d she says. Instead, she hopes that the universal bag will encourage shoppers to think of long-term solutions. \u201cThe less we sell, the better. I want people to buy one, use it for 10 years and more, and then recycle it.\u201d\nZoe Avison, of the environmental thinktank Green Alliance, welcomes the arrival of a bag likely to appeal to consumers. \u201cIf it encourages shoppers to ditch their throwaway habits it will have a positive impact,\u201d she says.\nBut she puts the onus on the supermarkets to create lasting and meaningful change. \u201cIf cheap bags for life are still available at the till, this bag is unlikely to be transformative\u201d she says. \u201cThe UK should look to Ireland, where bag use has dropped 90% after a minimum charge of 70 cents was introduced.\u201d",

The time-honoured \u201cgreatest games of all time\u201d magazine feature lives on as clip compilations soundtracked by thrice-remixed SoundCloud rap.

I just got on my bike and Freddie Steward slowed him down enough for me to get there. It was more instinct than anything else.\u201d\nModest is another word the flanker should consider. Even with Farrell back to face Australia, it really is time that Lawes was more widely celebrated. As an athlete, remarkably, he still feels he is improving and off the pitch he has never been shy to be his own man. \u201cYou should accept everyone, right?\u201d he murmurs, discussing whether some more tattoos might have helped Will Carling\u2019s image back in his England captaincy days. \u201cAs long as you\u2019re a good person I think you should be accepted for who you are.\u201d\nThere is much, much more to big Courtney than a few heavily inked limbs, a penchant for crunching tackles and a love of reggae and R&B. Before going on this summer\u2019s British & Irish Lions tour \u2013 where he started every Test \u2013 he was involved with the Centre for Social Justice thinktank and spoke in favour \u2013 \u201cin whatever form it comes\u201d \u2013 of a stable family unit and extending the school day to give pupils more time for physical exercise. Not everyone on social media approved but he remains unfazed. \u201cIf people ask me a question I\u2019m going to give an honest answer. I\u2019m not really bothered about who that offends because that\u2019s my opinion. If other people don\u2019t share it, no problem at all.\u201d\nStraight talking comes naturally. It was not unknown for his mother, Valerie, a prison officer, to return home from a tough shift with a few bruises. His father, Linford, emigrated to Britain from Jamaica as a youngster and once worked as a nightclub bouncer. Fight the Lawes and, as the Clash always warned, the Lawes will win. \u201cFor a lot of my childhood Mum was working. Dad would bounce at night and look after me during the day. I\u2019m very similar to my dad and that\u2019s probably a big reason why. He did a good job bringing me up and I\u2019m very thankful for the way it shaped me.\u201d\nGrowing up in Northampton also taught him about class. Where he came from, despite Franklin\u2019s Gardens being nearby, rugby was often seen as someone else\u2019s game. \u201cAt one point it was difficult to get into rugby if you didn\u2019t go to a nicer school. I would never have played if I hadn\u2019t gone to Northampton school for boys. Rugby wasn\u2019t the best in terms of people from working-class and middle-class backgrounds having access to it.\u201d\nWhich is why Lawes becoming England\u2019s captain, even for a week, should be celebrated. The current men\u2019s squad is more diverse than it has ever been and the 117kg forward believes any naysayers should update their prejudices. \u201cIf people haven\u2019t been to a game they shouldn\u2019t pretend to know what it\u2019s like. At least go and see it before you criticise. As long as rugby keeps its integrity and core values that give working-class people something good they can buy into \u2013 culture, respect and hard work \u2013 it can really help people.\u201d\nHow much longer, though, can Lawes realistically stay at his sporting peak? He made his Test debut against Australia 12 years ago this month and now lives in the Northamptonshire countryside 10 minutes away from his friend Dylan Hartley \u2013 \u201cthe skipper I enjoyed playing under most\u201d \u2013 whose England career ended at 32. Lawes, who turns 33 in February, knows he cannot go on for ever. \u201cWhen you\u2019re younger you can train like a nutter the whole week and be fine at the weekend. When you get older you can\u2019t quite do that.\u201d\nThere is also no avoiding rugby\u2019s potential longer-term medical risks. \u201cIt\u2019s tough, man. What\u2019s your body\u2019s going to be like when you\u2019re 40? I\u2019ve played for years and I\u2019ve been hit on the head a few times. Of course you think about it. At the end of the day, though, I don\u2019t have to play rugby. If I think it\u2019s too dangerous I can not play. It\u2019s your choice. Rugby\u2019s a great game and that needs to be appreciated. The safer we can make it the better \u2026 but it\u2019s a physical, brutal game.\u201d\nThe good news, for now, is that he still feels able to make a serious top-level impact. \u201cEven though I\u2019m probably the oldest here I\u2019m not tailing off. I\u2019ve always worked hard and been very willing to put my body on the line. It means people can rely on you to front up when the big games turn up.\n\u201cWhere can this England team go? I think we\u2019re on the cusp of finding something new. A team that\u2019s not just here because it\u2019s a great honour or for the money but because it\u2019s a good place to be. That\u2019s the kind of environment you need if you want to win anything, especially a World Cup.\u201d Three words to describe big Courtney? Not. Finished. Yet.",

        "content": "Dutch-Portuguese war of 1645 split the Potiguara people but their leaders\u2019 correspondence across battle lines has finally been translated from Tupi\nIn 1645, a bloody war raged between Dutch settlers and the Portuguese empire over the sugar plantations of north-east Brazil.\nTrapped on either side of the conflict were the Potiguara, a powerful indigenous nation whose leaders penned a series of letters in the Tupi language, enticing their relatives to defect across enemy lines.\nNow, a painstaking new translation of the correspondence has been hailed as a \u201chuge achievement\u201d in casting new light on these unique sources written by a native people.\nThe forthcoming publication is the fruit of 30 years of work by Eduardo de Almeida Navarro, a specialist in classical indigenous languages at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hugely exciting to be able to make this contribution to the history of my country,\u201d said Navarro.\nThe letters were first uncovered in the Dutch archives in 1885, but the texts were blotted and jumbled. Many words were not in existing glossaries of Tupi, which gives us words like piranha and jaguar. In 1906, one frustrated translator called the letters \u201cgenuine enigmas\u201d.\nNavarro spent decades compiling a comprehensive ancient Tupi dictionary, drawing on the accounts of French traders and English buccaneers. This helped him fully translate the letters, revealing the desperate efforts of the Potiguara chiefs to save their people from destruction.\n\u201cWhy,\u201d wrote Felipe Camar\u00e3o, a Potiguara captain fighting for Portugal, \u201cdo I make war against people of our own blood? \u2026 Come to me and I will forgive you. I will make you one with your ancient culture again. Those that stay there will be destroyed.\u201d\nCamar\u00e3o\u2019s pleas were dismissed: his messenger was executed by Pedro Poti, a rival chief who had spent five years in the Netherlands and converted to Calvinism.\nThe Dutch were eventually expelled from Brazil. Camar\u00e3o was knighted; Poti was tortured and died on a ship bound for Portugal. Many Potiguara were massacred, although some held out in the forest.\nNavarro\u2019s work has been applauded among the 20,000 Potiguara still living in the north-eastern Brazilian state of Para\u00edba.\n\u201cFor us, it\u2019s a huge achievement,\u201d said Pedro Ka\u2019Aguasu Potiguara, a teacher from Ibicoara. \u201cThe letters are full of details and information, and very important for our people. They show that, 400 years ago, we were one of the only indigenous peoples that could write.\u201d\nPortuguese priests banned the Potiguara from speaking Tupi in the mid-1700s, part of centuries of European \u201clooting, domination and genocide\u201d, he lamented.\nBut since 2001, with Navarro\u2019s help, his people have been recovering their lost language.\n\u201cBefore we only spoke a few words. Now, we\u2019ve started teaching Tupi to our kids, through music, singing and writing, up to middle school. They learn really quickly,\u201d said Ka\u2019Aguasu Potiguara, who wants the missives to be brought to Brazil so his people can learn from them in person.\nPoti and those who sided with the Dutch are often viewed in Brazil as \u201ctraitors\u201d, while Camar\u00e3o is officially recognised as a hero, said Mark Meuwese, a historian at the University of Winnipeg. The new translation could challenge this two-dimensional portrayal, he suggested.\n\u201cEach wanted the best for the Potiguara,\u201d argued Nath\u00e1lia Galdino, a Potiguara student nurse and political activist from Alto do Tamb\u00e1. \u201cIn Felipe Camar\u00e3o\u2019s letters I can feel his pain, at being divided as a people.\n\u201cBut those ancestors tried to find a way forward, so that we present-day Potiguara could be alive today, fighting for our culture and raising our children in our own territory,\u201d she added.\n\u201cEven if they were on opposite sides, all had the dream of rebuilding their land and continuing their traditions,\u201d agreed Ka\u2019Aguasu Potiguara. \u201cEach of them was a hero.\u201d",

        "content": "World\u2019s largest shipping company Maersk plans to power new container ships on carbon-neutral methanol but very little of it is produced today\nIn August, Maersk, the world\u2019s largest shipping company, announced that it would add eight new container ships to its fleet that would be unlike any merchant vessels operating on the high seas today. Instead of running on \u201cbunker\u201d fuel \u2013 the gunky, tar-like substance left behind after oil is refined \u2013 Maersk plans to power these ships on carbon-neutral methanol, a colorless liquid made from biomass such as agricultural waste or by combining renewably generated hydrogen with carbon dioxide.\nGlobally, very little of this \u201cgreen\u201d methanol is produced today and compared with the oil industry waste product most ships run on, the cost is high. Maersk hasn\u2019t yet announced a fuel supply for its new fleet but the company hopes that standing up the world\u2019s first green methanol-powered fleet will spur the energy sector to significantly ramp up production of clean fuels.\n\u201cRather than talking about how this can\u2019t be done, let\u2019s just get started and let\u2019s start scaling,\u201d said Morten Bo-Christiansen, the head of decarbonization at Maersk.\nIt\u2019s a small step toward the enormous goal of decarbonizing shipping, an industry that accounts for roughly 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions and is far off track from meeting the goals of the Paris climate agreement.\nUntil now, shipping companies, which operate in remote international waters far from the public eye, have managed to avoid meaningful climate regulation. But the industry is facing a reckoning. The US, the EU and other big economies are starting to make pledges and draw up plans to green the shipping sector and at Cop26, a coalition of countries including the UK and the US signed a declaration committing to \u201cstrengthen global efforts\u201d to reach net zero by 2050.\nBusiness leaders are starting to take note. \u201cOur crews see this as the number one thing on their boardroom agenda now,\u201d said Guy Platten, the secretary general of the International Chamber of Shipping, a trade association that represents roughly 80% of the world\u2019s merchant fleet.\nThe shipping industry is a critical pillar of the global economy, with about 90% of all globally traded goods \u2013 from oil and steel to furniture and iPhones \u2013 ferried around the world by sea. In order to move all those goods, merchant ships burn approximately 300m metric tons of dirty fossil fuels each year, emitting roughly 1bn metric tons of carbon dioxide in the process. That is roughly equivalent to the annual carbon emissions of Japan.\nThe shipping industry will have to eliminate those carbon emissions by 2050 in order to stay in line with the Paris climate agreement\u2019s 1.5C global heating target. But between 2012 and 2018, its emissions rose by 10%. The International Maritime Organization (IMO), the UN body that regulates shipping, predicts that by 2050, the industry\u2019s emissions could be 30% higher than they were in 2008.\nFor that to change, tougher regulations are needed. The IMO adopted an initial energy efficiency regulation for ships in 2011, which set minimum fuel efficiency requirements per mile traveled and another one this June aimed at reducing the carbon intensity of ships by 40% by 2030.\nThose standards have \u201cbasically codified a business as usual trend\u201d, says Fa\u00efg Abbasov, the shipping program director at the Belgium-based non-profit Transport & Environment. The June measure requires shipping companies to give their vessels an A-E grade on energy efficiency and submit a \u201ccorrective action plan\u201d for any ships that receive a D or E for three consecutive years. But the scores will not be made public and no mechanism exists to force dirty ships to improve, said Abbasov.\nIn 2018, the IMO set a goal of cutting the industry\u2019s carbon pollution at least in half by 2050. But it hasn\u2019t adopted any binding emissions reduction targets or regulations to achieve the target and even if it did, the goal is still far short of what\u2019s needed to remain in line with the Paris agreement. Industry observers ascribe this partly to the slow nature of rule-making at the IMO, but also to corporate influence at the UN agency, where industry representatives are frequently appointed to serve on state delegations.\n\u201cThere\u2019s very little doubt\u201d the shipping industry has stalled IMO climate regulations, said Aoife O\u2019Leary, the CEO of Opportunity Green, a non-profit focused on international climate issues including shipping.\nBut change appears to be on the horizon. The EU is now moving to regulate shipping emissions under its emissions trading system, with a phase-in beginning in 2023. Under the proposed law, by 2026 shipping companies will need to pay for the carbon they emit traveling to and from the EU and between EU ports.\nSeparately, the EU is proposing a fuel mandate that would compel the industry to use a progressively greater share of low- and zero-carbon fuels in its ships. And in April, the US committed to pursuing a zero emissions shipping industry by 2050.\nWhile the shipping industry has pushed back against the idea of a patchwork of climate regulations across different nations, O\u2019Leary said these could compel the IMO to take more ambitious action. \u201cIf you look at the history of IMO regulations, they\u2019ve often acted because the EU or the US have acted on their own,\u201d she said.\nThe industry does seem more eager to talk about climate. In March, the International Chamber of Shipping proposed a carbon levy of $2 a metric ton of fuel to go towards research and development of clean shipping technology. This proposal, along with a far more ambitious proposal by the Marshall Islands to tax merchant vessels to the tune of $100 a metric ton of bunker fuel, will be discussed at an IMO meeting in late November.\nPlatten of the International Chamber of Shipping wouldn\u2019t say whether the industry would support the specific fuel tax proposed by the Marshall Islands. But he said that shipping businesses \u201cwelcome the discussion and debate of market-based measures\u201d to drive down emissions and make low and zero carbon synthetic fuels more economically viable. In October, the ICS called for next zero emissions for the industry by 2050, doubling the ambitions of the IMO.\nTransforming the shipping sector means zero-carbon fuels must become available on a commercial scale, along with the infrastructure required to pump them into ships. Green methanol, ammonia and hydrogen can all be made with renewable energy, in processes that start with splitting water in an electrolyzer to produce hydrogen. But while green methanol can be dropped into existing ships with fairly minimal retrofits, the other two will require significant modifications of ship designs and operational procedures.\nAmmonia and hydrogen are gases at room temperature and will need refrigerated tanks to store as liquids. Ammonia is also toxic to marine life and humans, raising safety and environmental concerns. Hydrogen, meanwhile, has a very low energy density compared with oil, which means that ships using it would have to carry much larger volumes of fuel, or be refilled far more often.\nProving that alternative fuels are safe and reliable to use on commercial vessels, then scaling them up and deploying them across the global shipping industry will be an expensive and time-consuming endeavor.\n\u201cWhat we are really looking at is decades of investment and innovation ahead of us,\u201d said Bo Cerup-Simonsen, the CEO of the Maersk Mc-Kinney Moller Center for Zero Carbon Shipping, a research and development center. \u201cIt\u2019s fair to say that we\u2019re talking billions,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I think the trillions come when we start to scale this up to become industry wide.\u201d\nResearchers have estimated that if zero emissions fuels comprise 5% of the international shipping fuel mix by 2030, the industry will be on a path to fully decarbonize by 2050. The Global Maritime Forum\u2019s Getting to Zero Coalition believes that target is achievable based on recently announced plans, including the EU\u2019s 2020 Hydrogen Strategy, which calls for building at least 40 gigawatts of renewable hydrogen electrolyzers by 2030, as well as China and Japan\u2019s goals to ramp up hydrogen fuel production.\nWhile the task ahead is daunting, Cerup-Simonsen is optimistic. The number of large companies expressing interest in carbon-free shipping is growing \u201cday by day\u201d, he said, as is interest from their customers. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing mining companies, some of the big retailers, big auto manufacturers starting to demand a greening of their supply chains, including shipping,\u201d Cerup-Simonsen said.\nLarge consumer-facing businesses could be key in helping to drive change in the shipping industry, says Madeline Rose, the climate campaign director at Pacific Environment who recently led a report on the shipping pollution associated with 15 major retail brands, including Amazon, Walmart and Target.\nIn 2019 alone, the report found that these companies were responsible for three coal fired power plants\u2019 worth of carbon pollution through their US shipping imports. Despite making ambitious climate pledges in recent years, most of the companies highlighted in the report do not appear to account for marine pollution in their corporate emissions reporting.\nAmazon, along with companies including Ikea and Unilever, signed a pledge in October to only move goods on ships using zero carbon fuel by 2040.\nWhile retailers demanding cleaner shipping could motivate shipping companies to bring new options online faster, Abbasov of Transport & Environment is doubtful that voluntary corporate pledges will drive transformative change. For now, he says, regulations are needed to make alternative fuels more economically attractive and prevent corporate greenwashing.\n\u201cOnce there are regulations, once the technology has become very common, individual companies can take one extra step and go further than the law says,\u201d Abbasov said. \u201cFor shipping, we\u2019re not there just yet.\u201d\n This article was amended on 15 November 2021 to correct the name of the Getting to Zero Coalition which had been given as the \u201cGetting to Net Zero Coalition\u201d in an earlier version.",

        "content": "Ron Flowers, who has died aged 87, played football of such quality and consistency across such a prolonged period that his career was able to span not just a whole era of huge achievement at Wolverhampton Wanderers in the 1950s, but England\u2019s victorious 1966 World Cup victory and beyond.\nHe won three First Division titles and an FA Cup with Wolves during a golden period at the club, and was 31 when called up for the 1966 World Cup finals as the oldest player in England\u2019s 22-man squad. While he did not actually play in any of the matches during that tournament, he came agonisingly close to appearing in the 4-2 defeat of West Germany in the final. On the night before the match, Flowers was told by the England manager, Alf Ramsey, that Jack Charlton had taken ill \u2013 and that if he was no better in the morning then he would be in the starting lineup.\nAfter a sleepless night, it transpired that Charlton had made a recovery, and so Flowers had to sit out the match on the bench. Under the rules that then pertained, Flowers therefore did not receive a World Cup winners\u2019 medal, although many years later football\u2019s governing body changed its mind, and \u2013 along with a number of other members of the England squad \u2013 he took delivery of one at 10 Downing Street in 2009.\nThe 1966 tournament had been a second tilt at the World Cup for Flowers, who had played with distinction in the 1962 version in Chile. By that time he had been at the top level of the game for a decade with a great Wolves side, and had retreated from an attacking midfield position at wing-half to a more defensive role, playing at left-half for England with Bobby Moore, newly capped, on the right. Twice Flowers would show his cool accuracy from the penalty spot in Chile, first in the opening game, which was lost 2-1 to Hungary, and then in the 3-1 victory against Argentina in the third, before England lost to Brazil in the quarter-finals.\nHe had not looked quite so assured when he made his debut for England against France in Paris as a 20-year-old in 1955. Playing at wing-half, Flowers found that the long passing ethos of Wolves had become so ingrained in his play that he kept firing the ball ahead of Stanley Matthews to run on to, rather than directly at his feet, as the great winger always required. As a result, he did not play for his country for another three years.\nHowever, Flowers returned to the fold in 1958 for a home international against Wales, and would keep his England place with only an occasional absence for the next seven years, having a run of 40 consecutive games at one point.\nHe was still there in 1966, playing against Norway in Oslo on the eve of the World Cup, although that match turned out to be the last of his 49 international caps. He captained his country three times and scored 10 goals, with a six-out-of-six penalty record.\nBorn the son of a coalminer in Edlington, near Doncaster, Flower was spotted as a schoolboy playing for Edlington grammar school and then Yorkshire Boys. He developed his talents at Wath Wanderers, then a nursery team for Wolves, and signed for the Midlands club as a professional on his 18th birthday. The Wolves manager, Stan Cullis, gave him his debut a couple of months later in September 1952, against Blackpool. Flowers scored with a header in that match and played 20 games in the 1952-53 season, establishing himself as a regular attacking midfielder in a team that became a dominant force in English football for the best part of a decade.\nWith Wolves he won the First Division championship in 1953-54, 1957-58 and 1958-59 \u2013 and the FA Cup in 1960 after a 3-0 defeat of Blackburn Rovers. He also played in the pioneering \u201cfloodlit friendlies\u201d at Wolves against continental European sides such as Honved and Real Madrid, which caught the imagination of the British public.\nEventually the good times ended, and Cullis was sacked in 1964 when Wolves were relegated. Flowers helped his team regain First Division status after two seasons, but left at the end of the 1966-67 season to become player-manager of Northampton Town, having played 515 games for Wolves.\nAt Northampton he made 62 league appearances, but in his second season the team were relegated to the Fourth Division, and in 1969 he switched to become player-manager at non-league Telford United, whom he led to the first ever final of the FA Trophy, losing 2-0 to Macclesfield Town in 1970. He lost his job at Telford in October 1971 and then moved out of the game to concentrate on running a successful sportswear store in Wolverhampton, which still flourishes. He was made MBE earlier this year.\nHe is survived by his wife, Yvonne Hart, whom he married in 1957, and their two sons.\n Ron Flowers, footballer, born 28 July 1934; died 12 November 2021",

An unnamed source told the newspaper: \u201cEamonn\u2019s move to GB News marks the end of an era. He\u2019ll be missed by many ITV viewers but, the truth is, this job offer probably came at just the right moment for both him and ITV. All good things come to an end.\u201d\nITV and GB News have been approached for comment.\nBorn in Belfast, Holmes started his broadcasting career in 1979 at Ulster Television, the ITV franchise in Northern Ireland. He has since worked for ITV\u2019s GMTV and for Sky News, and has presented sports coverage and quizshows.\nGB News launched in June with its then chairman, Andrew Neil, claiming it would not \u201cslavishly follow the existing news agenda\u201d, would cover \u201cthe stories that matter to you and those that have been neglected\u201d and deliver \u201ca huge range of voices that reflect the views and values of our United Kingdom\u201d.\nNeil was the face of GB News before it went on air, but left after presenting just eight programmes in three months, because of technical hitches, the loss of senior staff and differences of opinion over its political direction.\nNeil left the chairman\u2019s seat as well as his presenting duties at GB News, which is run by the former Sky News Australia chief executive Angelos Frangopoulos, claiming it \u201cwould have killed me\u201d to carry on.\nFrom July, Farage, the former Brexit party and Ukip MEP, will host his eponymous evening show on Monday to Thursday and has replaced Neil as the face of the channel.",

The attack reportedly lasted several minutes and resulted in Hamraoui needing stitches to her legs and hands, meaning she had to miss a match against Real Madrid in which Diallo played.\nAFP reported that Diallo was restrained by one assailant during the attack but was not physically injured. Hamraoui and Diallo are teammates in France\u2019s national team and close friends who have holidayed together.\nDiallo, capped seven times, joined PSG from the rival French club Guingamp in 2016.",

        "content": "Former White House chief of staff did not appear for scheduled appearance before select committee investigating Capitol attack\nFormer Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows is facing a criminal referral to the justice department for contempt of Congress after he failed to appear for an immediate deposition on Friday morning before the House select committee investigating the Capitol attack.\nThe move to threaten criminal prosecution for Meadows amounts to an abrupt and sharp escalation for the select committee as it seeks to enforce its subpoena against one of Donald Trump\u2019s closest aides first issued in September.\nBennie Thompson, the chairman of the select committee, said in a letter to Meadows\u2019s attorney on Thursday that the panel had exhausted its patience with Meadows, and his failure to appear at the deposition would be viewed as an instance of willful noncompliance.\nThe chairman said that his failure to appear would force the select committee to \u201cconsider invoking contempt of Congress procedures\u201d that could result in a criminal referral to the justice department, as well as the possibility of a civil action to enforce the subpoena.\nBut despite the threat of criminal prosecution, Meadows did not attend his deposition, scheduled to take place with select committee counsel in a small conference room tucked away inside a nondescript House office building on Capitol Hill.\nThe attorney for Meadows, George Terwilliger, said in a statement on Friday that his client would not appear before the select committee until a court ruled whether he could be compelled to testify and whether, even if he could, he had to answer questions.\n\u201cIt would be irresponsible for Mr Meadows to prematurely resolve that dispute by voluntarily waiving privileges that are at the heart of those legal issues,\u201d Terwilliger said.\nThe select committee waited for Meadows until 10 minutes after his scheduled deposition time. Leaving the conference room, counsel for the select committee declined to comment when asked whether the panel would immediately move to hold Meadows in contempt.\nThe select committee is targeting Meadows since his role as Trump\u2019s former White House chief of staff means he may hold the key to uncovering Trump\u2019s involvement in efforts on 6 January to stop the congressional certification of Joe Biden\u2019s election victory.\nThe select committee also believes that Meadows remained by Trump\u2019s side for most of 6 January, and was therefore in a unique position to know what the former president was privately thinking and doing at the White House as the deadly attack on the Capitol unfolded.\nBut after Trump instructed his former aides to defy the subpoenas on grounds of executive privilege, Meadows moved to negotiate with the select committee about the scope of his cooperation \u2013 which members on the panel suspect was an effort to stall the inquiry.\nThose suspicions among members on the select committee appeared to be bolstered on Thursday after Terwilliger, said in a statement that Meadows was \u201cimmune\u201d from congressional testimony under justice department opinions.\n\u201cMr Meadows remains under the instructions of former President Trump to respect long-standing principles of executive privilege. It now appears the courts will have to resolve this conflict,\u201d Terwilliger added.\nThompson said in the letter that rejected the notion that Meadows was immune from testifying to the select committee, noting that every federal court has ruled that presidential aides have no such protections in spite of the justice department opinions.\nThe chairman also noted that Meadows had not produced any materials demanded in his subpoena \u2013 including those not covered by executive privilege \u2013 though weeks had passed since Terwilliger indicated he would review which records to release.\nThompson said in the letter that his patience had expired and demanded that Meadows appear with the requested documents at a deposition on Friday. Noncompliance by Meadows would force the select committee to pursue contempt proceedings, he added.\nThe White House on Thursday backed Thompson, notifying Terwilliger in a separate letter that Biden would not assert executive privilege \u2013 a power wielded by sitting presidents \u2013 or immunity over the documents and deposition requested by the select committee.\n\u201cPresident Biden has determined that he will not assert immunity to preclude your client from testifying before the select committee,\u201d deputy White House counsel Jonathan Su said in an office of legal counsel letter first reported by the Washington Post.\nThompson\u2019s warning on Thursday was his third threat against a recalcitrant witness since House investigators starting issuing subpoenas to dozens of top former Trump administration officials and pro-Trump activists connected to the 6 January insurrection.\nThe chairman last week raised the possibility of holding former Trump justice department official Jeffrey Clark in contempt of Congress after he appeared for a deposition pursuant to a subpoena but refused to answer any questions, citing attorney-client privilege.\nLast month, the House voted to refer Trump\u2019s former chief strategist Steve Bannon to the justice department for prosecution after the select committee unanimously recommended his referral after he ignored his September subpoena in its entirety.",

Leaseholders receiving bills for repairs of up to \u00a3100,000 have voiced fury at seeing that 20% of that is tax.\nThis week Michael Gove, the secretary of state for levelling up, housing and communities, said the long-awaited bill would pass through parliament before Christmas. A cross-party alliance is expected to press for the zero-rating on VAT, including recouping tax paid on works already carried out, as well as measures to protect leaseholders under a \u201cpolluter pays\u201d principle.\nStephen McPartland, the Conservative MP for Stevenage, said the VAT change would correct an unfair anomaly, in that the developers of the defective blocks did not have to pay VAT because new-builds are exempt, but leaseholders have to pay 20% extra to make those defects safe, because repairs are taxed.\n\u201cIt\u2019s another example of the leaseholders paying for other people\u2019s mistakes,\u201d said McPartland, who has enlisted 23 other Conservative MPs to support his amendments. \u201cSo far the government has offered a \u00a35bn fund [for leaseholders in buildings taller than 18 metres with defective cladding] but it gets \u00a31bn of that back immediately.\u201d\nOther Tory backers include Royston Smith, Damian Green, Bob Blackman and Tracey Crouch.\nThey also want VAT to be removed from the costs of fire safety patrols \u2013 known as waking watch \u2013 which are operating in about 1,000 blocks in London and more elsewhere. The average cost per household in London is almost \u00a3500 a month.\nLiam Spender, an affected leaseholder and cladding scandal campaigner, said: \u201cThe government should not be making a profit. Leaseholders are being forced to pick up these bills because of poor regulation and shoddy construction. For the same reason, the government should also be looking at some mechanism to refund insurance premium tax it is currently collecting on hugely inflated buildings insurance premiums. Some of these insurers seem to be ripe for a windfall tax on their profits from this.\u201d\nIn what some leaseholders welcomed as a change in government tone on solving the building safety crisis, Gove said on Monday: \u201cThere is an urgent need to deal with the persistence of ACM cladding on tall buildings, but there is an equally urgent need to ensure justice is done.\u201d\nHe told the select committee on levelling up, housing and communities: \u201cThe government has a responsibility to make buildings safe but we also have a responsibility to relieve some of the obligations faced by leaseholders at the moment who are innocent parties in this and in many circumstances are being asked to pay disproportionate sums when there are individuals in business, some of them still in business, who are guilty men and women.\u201d\nA spokesperson for the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said: \u201cIt is unacceptable and unfair that leaseholders are facing excessive bills\u201d and that building owners must not pass on costs of making buildings safe.\n\u201cThe government is providing \u00a35bn to remove unsafe cladding in the highest risk buildings and we have so far processed over 600 building applications, with estimated remediation costs of \u00a32.5bn,\u201d they said. \u201cThe new secretary of state is looking afresh at this issue to make sure everything is being done to protect and support those affected, and further details will be set out in due course.\u201d",

They have toiled since winning promotion and are unlikely to have much to spend during the January transfer window.\nNorwich, who sacked Farke after their victory over Brentford last Saturday, will continue to speak to other candidates. Lampard\u2019s withdrawal could increase Smith\u2019s chances of landing the job. Smith was sacked by Aston Villa last Sunday and has admirers at Carrow Road, although it is understood that he needs a few days to decide whether he wants to return to management so quickly.\nNorwich have also been linked with Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl but they are unlikely to be able to lure the Austrian from Southampton.

That figure is expected to double when details of the 2017-20 cycle are released.\nMinky Worden, director of global initiatives at HRW, said: \u201cThe time for quiet diplomacy is over. It\u2019s time for the Top sponsors to urge the International Olympic Committee to adopt human rights. It\u2019s time for them to disclose their own supply chains in China, particularly any products that have the five rings of the Olympics.\u201d\nChina\u2019s foreign ministry spokesperson, Wang Wenbin, accused HRW of lying in order to undermine the Chinese games. \u201cTo politicise sports by fabricating lies and rumours and undermining the Olympic cause is unpopular and will never succeed,\u201d he said at a daily briefing on Friday.\nAllianz, the only sponsor to reply to the HRW letter sent six months ago, said: \u201cWe stand behind the Olympic movement and our longstanding support for its ideals will not waver.\u201d\nA US congressional committee has previously accused the US-based sponsors of putting profits ahead of accusations of genocide in China.\nChris Smith, a Republican representing New Jersey, told the congressional executive commission on China in July that the sponsors needed to reconcile their \u201costensible commitment to human rights\u201d with subsidising an Olympics where the host country is \u201cactively committing human rights abuses\u201d.\nWhen asked whether the games should be moved away from China, Paul Lalli, Coca-Cola\u2019s global vice-president for human rights, said: \u201cWe do not make decisions on these host locations. We support and follow the athletes wherever they compete.\u201d",

So Home Alone 2 soon followed, a film that imagined even more unforgivable parental negligence, and then somehow a franchise too, with three more overcalculated misadventures on top, the genuine festive sparkle of the original fading into dusk.\nThe prospect of yet another one, this time with some vague same universe ties to the first, has created more ire than these things usually do since the trailer dropped last month, a sign of both the original\u2019s enduring fandom and an increased fatigue with revisiting and repeating well-worn property. But dropping on Disney+ in time for its younger target audience to watch, rewatch and then watch again by the big day, Home Sweet Home Alone is a surprisingly entertaining, if wholly unnecessary, sequel, a tangerine where we expected to find a lump of coal.\nWhat prevents the film from being just another limp bot-written recital is a surprisingly sharp sense of humour, with a script from the Saturday Night Live duo Mikey Day and Streeter Seidell and direction from Borat\u2019s Dan Mazer, a more comically adept behind-the-camera team than one would expect from a Home Alone sequel. Their combined involvement has also attracted a funnier cast than anticipated, with This Way Up\u2019s Aisling Bea, Kimmy Schmidt\u2019s Ellie Kemper, Crashing\u2019s Pete Holmes, Veep\u2019s Timothy Simons and Catastrophe\u2019s Rob Delaney alongside SNL favourites Kenan Thompson and Chris Parnell. Reviews have thus far been mostly disdainful but there\u2019s an admirable sense of pluck to the film, as if those involved know very well they\u2019re making something that doesn\u2019t need to exist but they\u2019re making the most of it anyway.\nArchie Yates, one of the least awful things about Taika Waititi\u2019s mostly awful Jojo Rabbit, is the latest Kevin replacement, Max, undervalued and underappreciated by his family, headed up by Bea\u2019s beleaguered mother. Through the standard set of far-fetched circumstances, he\u2019s left behind as the family head to Tokyo but initial bliss soon turns (a little too quickly this time) into crushing loneliness. His blandly anonymous show home house is set upon not by burglars but by a cash-strapped married couple, played by Delaney and Kemper, who believe that Max has stolen a vintage doll of theirs worth $200,000. Violence ensues.\nThere\u2019s a flat and familiar cheapness to Home Sweet Home Alone that quickly reminds us that we\u2019re no longer in the 90s and no longer in the cinema but very much streaming at home in a world of low budgets and low expectations. Chris Columbus\u2019s original popped with colour, the McAllister house styled in aggressive reds and greens, a film that screamed Christmas in every frame. Visually Mazer\u2019s follow-up is far blander in every conceivable way but no attempt to revisit the franchise was ever going to come close and going in thinking as such is a fool\u2019s errand. Instead, there\u2019s enough pleasure from watching the enthusiastic cast go through the motions with a wink, committed to the silliness and pointlessness of the entire endeavour. Day and Seidell\u2019s script has a fun, freewheeling SNL vibe to it, aided by one of the show\u2019s funniest MVPs Thompson in a too-small role and especially Kemper, whose brand of manic ebullience works so well here, especially when sentimentality arrives, her faux-earnestness cutting through the saccharine (unlike in the first film, the emotional kick never really comes).\nWhen the last act mayhem arrives, there\u2019s a slightly knowing edge to the carnage, with both invaders commenting on the serious medical damage they\u2019re facing (a note that could have been played a little more, in my opinion) but the traps are a little unimaginative and Yates\u2019s line delivery a little mechanical in comparison to Macaulay Culkin, the slapstick becoming repetitive and ineffective. There\u2019s also a predictable cop-out twist that softens what could have been the film\u2019s more ingeniously dark addition to the formula.\nIt\u2019s easy to understand the wearied baggage many come to the film with but Home Sweet Home Alone is a perfectly fine and at times genuinely funny sequel that\u2019s as good as it needs to be. Will we be rewatching it in 20 years time? I don\u2019t think so.\nHome Sweet Home Alone is now available on Disney+",

The consumer division, which is expected to generate $15bn (\u00a311bn) in sales this year and employs 19,000 people, will be split off in 18 to 24 months\u2019 time, probably through a stock offering, following similar moves from rivals such as GSK.\nJ&J will be left with its pharmaceutical and medical devices businesses, which make drugs for prostate cancer and other diseases, vaccines and surgical tools and are forecast to generate revenues of $77bn this year. It is the only major pharma company to have developed a single-shot vaccine for Covid-19, sold on a not-for-profit basis; all the other vaccines require two jabs.\nThe new publicly traded consumer health company will have four megabrands with $1bn annual sales \u2013 Tylenol, Band-Aid, Johnson\u2019s (baby products) and Listerine \u2013 and make a host of other well-known products ranging from Neutrogena and Aveeno creams to Zyrtec allergy pills. It has leading positions in over-the-counter products such as cold and flu remedies and painkillers; skin health and beauty products; baby and feminine products; wound care treatments; and oral health products.\nJ&J is following other large healthcare companies that have spun off their consumer divisions to create slimmed-down pharmaceutical businesses focused on developing lucrative specialty drugs. GSK and New York-based Pfizer teamed up in 2018 to form a \u00a310bn joint venture from their consumer health arms and plan to spin off the venture next summer. Meanwhile, the German drugmaker Merck sold its consumer health division to the consumer products group Procter & Gamble in 2018.\nAndrew Duncan, senior equity analyst at the investment house Killik & Co, said: \u201cI don\u2019t expect the J&J shake-up \u2013 or GSK\u2019s for that matter \u2013 to have a significant impact on underlying operations, and certainly consumers shouldn\u2019t see much difference. After all, it\u2019s not clear how creating a standalone consumer entity will help J&J to sell more Listerine.\n\u201cWhat is more obvious perhaps is the rationale for J&J management to separate the lower-growth consumer unit from the high-margin pharmaceutical and medical devices units. It will be hoped that this will encourage investors to place a higher valuation on the individual pieces compared to the current conglomerate valuation, eventually creating more value for shareholders.\u201d\nJ&J\u2019s move is the third big corporate break-up announced globally this week. Outside the healthcare sector, the 129-year-old industrial conglomerate General Electric is breaking itself up into three public companies; and the Japanese conglomerate Toshiba announced on Friday that it is splitting into three businesses after years of scandals.\nJ&J employs 4,030 people across the UK, at its HQ and manufacturing, research and development sites in High Wycombe, Pinewood, Blackpool, Leeds and London. This includes 590 people at its consumer health division in High Wycombe.\nJ&J\u2019s consumer arm faces an avalanche of lawsuits alleging its baby powder was contaminated with cancer-causing asbestos, which the company has denied. It stopped selling baby powder in the US and Canada last year. Alex Gorsky, J&J\u2019s chief executive, said the decision to split off the consumer division was not related to the lawsuits.\nThe pharmaceuticals and medical division has also faced lawsuits. J&J has settled most of the lawsuits filed by thousands of men who claim the anti-psychotic drug Risperdal caused them to grow breasts. The company also faces a spate of lawsuits over the role its painkillers have played in the US opioid crisis.\nGorsky said: \u201cThe planned separation of the consumer health business is the best way to accelerate our efforts to serve patients, consumers, and healthcare professionals, create opportunities for our talented global team, drive profitable growth, and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 improve healthcare outcomes for people around the world.\u201d\nHe kicked off the process before he becomes executive chairman of J&J on 3 January and hands the chief executive role on to Joaquin Duato, who is currently vice-chairman of the firm\u2019s executive committee. Duato will continue to lead the new J&J after the shake-up.\nNicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cJ&J has been a bit of a black box healthcare conglomerate for years. There are businesses that are individually attractive, but all together in a big wrapper where investors stakes in the businesses they like are diluted by exposure to others they may not have found so attractive. Splitting up deals with that problem.\u201d",

Poorer households were more likely than richer households to report they would use them to reduce their debts.\nWith only two weeks until shoppers seek online bargains on Black Friday, the IFS said shoppers would keep the spending taps open, but would be more circumspect about running down savings.\nIn the latest figures from the Bank of England, deposit savings increased in September at the same time credit card balances also rose, indicating that better-off households were saving unspent wages while more vulnerable households needed to borrow to fund the purchase of essential items.\nHouseholds deposited an additional \u00a39.4bn with banks and building societies in September compared with an average of \u00a38.9bn between April and August.\nTo capitalise on the expected surge in spending, companies have ramped up their Christmas advertising on social media, TV, newspapers and magazines to record levels.\nITV said this week it was on track to enjoy the best year for advertising revenues in its 66-year history following a year-on-year increase in the first nine months of 30%, to \u00a31.3bn.\nPolicymakers at the central bank have forecast a rise in inflation to 5% by next spring and a slowdown in GDP growth linked to supply chain issues, such as the hold-ups of vital components for industry from abroad and labour shortages.\nThe IFS, which was funded by the Nuffield Foundation to carry out the research, said the composition of spending was also crucial after a bounce back in the sale of goods to levels higher than before the pandemic.\nIt said the sharp increase meant there was little room for any more explosive growth.\nMeanwhile, the purchase of services \u2013 from hairdressing to financial advice \u2013 had recovered more slowly from a 30% drop following last year\u2019s recession. The thinktank said the slow recovery was likely to continue while wealthy households remained reticent and the incomes of the poorest were squeezed by a mix of high inflation and extra costs related to the pandemic.\nMark Franks, director of welfare at the Nuffield Foundation, said he was concerned that the poorest households were the least likely to increase their spending after suffering a large proportionate drop in their overall wealth, \u201cespecially given the high levels of household poverty that already existed before the pandemic\u201d.",

        "content": "Some species in Brazil have shrunk by nearly 10% over 40 years of measurements, say researchers\nBirds in the Amazon are becoming smaller but growing longer wings, a study has found, with scientists saying global heating is the most likely explanation.\nSeveral recent papers have reported birds getting smaller, but as their subjects were migratory birds there were many confounding factors that could have explained the results, such as hunting, pesticide use or habitat loss.\nThe new study was conducted on non-migratory birds in pristine rainforest but the results were the same: the birds are getting smaller, and the warmer climate is the only known variable.\nThe research took place at the Amazon Biodiversity Center close to Manaus, in the Brazilian Amazon. Since the 1970s scientists have been using the remote area as a control location so they can study the effects of deforestation and development on the ecosystem.\nGenerations of scientists have been capturing and examining birds in the area with an unvarying methodology: they catch them in mist nets, weigh them and measure their wings.\nNow scientists analysing data on 77 bird species over the past 40 years say nearly every non-migratory species found there has become smaller. One-third of them also bear longer wings.\nThe researchers believe global heating is behind the morphological shift. Since the 1970s, the region has warmed 1.65C in the dry season and 1.0C in the wet season. In addition, the wet season has become wetter and dry season has become drier.\nLast year, Vitek Jirinec, the lead author of the new study, his adviser Philip Stouffer and colleagues published a paper reporting falling populations in nine of 79 non-migratory bird species in the control sites. Climate was the only factor that has changed there, as far as anyone knows, and they concluded it must be the cause.\nMost of the birds in the new paper, published in Science Advances, spend their lives within a radius of a few kilometres, but the researchers found some species had shrunk by nearly 10% over 40 years of measurements.\nJirinec, of the Integral Ecology Research Center in California, said changing temperature or precipitation \u2013 or both \u2013 must play a role in the findings.\nHow could climate change alter avian physique? One plausible explanation the researchers invoke is a 150-year-old principle called Bergmann\u2019s rule. It states that closely related organisms are smaller the closer they are to living at the equator, thought to be because larger bodies retain warmth better.\nJirinec\u2019s paper suggests the same process could be at work in the Amazon: increased temperatures, which one might normally expect to find closer to the equator, are causing smaller bodies.\nThe scientists say the increase in wing length is more puzzling but suggest birds may now need to fly further. They were unsure whether the changes were caused by evolutionary pressures \u2013 individuals with advantageous characteristics breeding more successfully \u2013 or whether the birds were changing shape as they aged to adapt to the changed environment.\nJirinec wonders whether the same pattern is occurring elsewhere, where nobody is carrying out the same research. \u201cWho knows where else this could be happening?\u201d he said.\nMario Cohn-Haft, an ornithologist at the National Institute of Amazonian Research Institute in Manaus, says the research worries him. But it also gives him new reasons to marvel at nature\u2019s genius: \u201cIt\u2019s impressive to imagine birds adapting their body type to the changing environment.\u201d\nDespite such concerns, Cohn-Haft said there was room for a little optimism. Perhaps, he said, with longer wings, now-sedentary species might begin migrating to more suitable habitats. \u201cMaybe they\u2019re not [the] passive, sitting ducks we might have imagined,\u201d he added.",

We look at what\u2019s on offer\nScott Morrison once claimed electric vehicles might end the weekend, but the prime minister changed his tune this week when he announced the Australian government\u2019s new EV policy.\nWhile the strategy may not actually do much to help get people into an electric vehicle, it\u2019s the start of a shift as state and territory governments are already setting up incentives to get more people into EVs.\nFor many who might be looking to ditch their petrol or diesel car, the biggest roadblock remains the upfront cost of a new EV \u2013 though this is quickly changing.\nChinese carmaker BYD has plans to release a EV hatchback that will retail for $35k but among the brands currently on sale in Australia \u2013 Nissan, Renault, Tesla, BMW, Audi, Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai, Jaguar, MG, Mini \u2013 the most affordable are the MG ZS EV, at $44,990, and the Nissan Leaf, which retails for $53,190.\nThese are roughly the same price as the Harley Davidson LiveWire electric bike at $49,995 but a fraction of the $373,670 luxury Porsche Taycan Turbo S.\nThose looking for a real bargain might try their hand in the secondhand market where it\u2019s possible to pick up a second-hand Nissan Leaf for around $15,000 \u2013 though be sure to check the battery before buying as they become less efficient over time.\nUnfortunately the choice of electric vehicle is still limited. Those living in the UK might be able to choose from over 130 models but Australians are limited to just 31 \u2013 a problem made worse with limited supply.\nA recent CommBank survey found the number of people buying new cars in October had risen 31% compared with the same time last year, but consumers were finding it difficult to actually get hold of a new car.\nThis is thanks in part to a worldwide computer chip shortage and global supply chain issues. As every modern car engine contains at least one computer, the chip shortage makes them harder to build, while shipping around the components and finished car is more difficult.\nHere in Australia the limited choice has been made worse by a lack of clear government policy that means global car makers just aren\u2019t prioritising the country.\nWhile companies such as Volkswagen expect to sell 400,000 electric vehicles this year, none will be in Australia, partly out of concerns proposals for a new EV user charge will put people off going electric.\nFor those who still can\u2019t afford to pay the large upfront cost, some providers such as AGL are now offering subscription EV models that effectively allow people to rent an EV.\nWhile the upfront cost of a new EV is steep, this expense is front-loaded over the lifetime of the vehicle. EV drivers obviously don\u2019t need to pay for petrol, while repair costs are lower as electric cars require fewer parts.\nWhen AGL calculated the difference using ABS statistics from 2019, they found the fuel bill on a petrol-driven car was $2,069 a year while the cost of charging an EV stood at $723.\nThese numbers can vary by state depending on the cost of electricity, the price of petrol and a person\u2019s access to rooftop solar at home, which remains the cheapest way to recharge.\nTo help with the high upfront costs, states and territories are introducing incentives to help, even if no two states are created equal.\nEV owners in New South Wales get the best deal by far, with drivers now able to apply for up to $78,000 in stamp duty reimbursed on purchases of new and used cars, while $3,000 rebates are being offered on the first 25,000 EVs sold in the state.\nA close second are drivers in the ACT, who will pay no stamp duty or registration for two years, while the territory government is offering $15,000 interest-free loans on new purchases.\nSouth Australia and Victoria are offering similar $3,000 rebates to those in New South Wales, while waivers on stamp duty and registration fees are available to drivers in Tasmania and South Australia respectively.\nWestern Australia, Queensland, Tasmania and Northern Territory currently offer no direct purchase incentives, but each state except WA offers waivers or discounts on registration or stamp duty.\nCharging an EV requires a plug-in cable, though the basic equipment that comes with most models will typically take around eight-to-12 hours to fill a battery, meaning that many drivers opt to install a fast-charging station at home.\nSet-up costs for these systems will add to the initial purchase cost, though there are dedicated companies like JET Charge that can handle home installations.\nThose caught out while on the road can access a growing network of fast-charging stations from companies like ChargeFox. Their stations can add 400kms of range in 15 minutes and can be found using their app.\nNew South Wales and South Australia have plans to introduce a charge but have said they will delay its introduction until 2027 to get electric vehicles off the ground in Australia, but Victoria has already begun collecting its user charge as of 1 July this year.\n As other countries such as Norway are already planning to end the sale of petrol vehicles as early as 2025, similar bans will eventually be picked up elsewhere over the next decade or so, making the decision to switch more a question of when than if.",

        "content": "From the Kelly gang to contemporary crimes, police have long offered money rewards in trying to solve cases. The question is: do they work \u2013 and how?\nFrom iconic bushranger Ned Kelly to serial killer Ivan Milat, the promise of cash to solve crimes has long been a feature of Australian policing.\nEach year rewards large and small are offered across the country, usually for information leading to a conviction, and often years, if not decades, after the crime.\nBut these conventions were turned on their head by the case of four-year-old Cleo Smith, who disappeared from her family\u2019s tent at an isolated West Australian campground in the early hours of 16 October. Six days after she went missing, the state government announced a $1m reward for information on Cleo\u2019s location, or that led to the arrest and conviction of her abductor.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not normal,\u201d former detective inspector Terry Goldsworthy tells Guardian Australia. \u201cIt\u2019s highly unusual, in that it\u2019s done at the start of the investigation.\u201d\nDr Goldsworthy, who spent 28 years with Queensland police before becoming an associate professor at Bond University, suggests two reasons for the early reward. One, Cleo\u2019s unique case lent itself to media attention which can influence how quickly a reward is offered. Two, it was an investigative tactic, and not a bad one. \u201cI think they were putting it out there to apply pressure to the suspect or suspects,\u201d he said.\nCleo\u2019s story ended happily, the little girl found in a Carnarvon home 18 days after she went missing. Terence Darrell Kelly, 36, has been charged with her abduction. But \u2013 at least according to police \u2013 the $1m reward was not the clincher.\nThe point of reward money is to elicit new information and move investigations forward. Most often, they are deployed at the end of an investigation, when leads are exhausted. The prime target, Dr Goldsworthy said, is usually a \u201crecalcitrant witness\u201d who has never come forward. They may be scared, or simply not want to be involved, and the thinking is the money could push them over the line.\nDr Goldsworthy says people like to imagine others would always come forward, but that was \u201cprobably utopian\u201d. \u201cSome people aren\u2019t that interested in what happens to other people until there\u2019s a benefit for them,\u201d he says.\nRewards can also be not just a carrot for witnesses, but part and parcel of the policing operation. A classic example, Dr Goldsworthy says, is offering a reward as detectives are tapping the phone of a prime suspect, watching carefully for an incriminating reaction.\nHowever, he says, one major drawback to rewards is that it can have the potential to hamper investigations with \u201cinformation overload\u201d.\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nSo do police rewards work? Sydney man Peter Rolfe is convinced they can move cases forward. He believes every unsolved murder should have a million dollar reward on offer.\nRolfe started a support group for people navigating the bewildering, desolate aftermath of homicide after his partner of 16 years, Stephen Dempsey, was murdered at Narrabeen in 1994. Since then, Rolfe has poured his grief into advocating for victims of homicide \u2013 including lobbying for rewards.\nIn an interview with Guardian Australia, he lists four New South Wales cases where million dollar rewards were offered and arrests made soon after. \u201cThe first one, Scott Johnson\u2026\u201d he begins. Johnson, an American mathematician, was found dead at the bottom of a cliff at Blue Fish Point, Manly, on a Saturday morning in December 1988. His brother, Steve, pledged to double the $1m on offer from NSW police in March 2020. Two months later, Scott White was arrested and charged with Johnson\u2019s murder. He has pleaded not guilty.\nHe also reels off the arrest of a man in August this year over the 1999 murder of schoolgirl Michelle Bright one day after NSW police announced a $1m reward. Police charged another man with the 2008 Valentine\u2019s Day murder of 66-year-old German national Bernd Lehmann, one month after a reward was offered. And advances were made in the investigation into the 1987 murder of Clayton man Raymond Keam. A man was charged in August 2021; police had offered the reward in June.\n\u201cSo they do work,\u201d Rolfe says. NSW police declined to comment on whether rewards are likely to be paid in the four cases, which are all yet to go to trial. It is not known whether the reward played any part in the arrests.\nBut many other cold cases stay on ice.\nThere is little publicly available information on police rewards claimed across Australia, but scattered freedom of information requests show rewards are occasionally, but not regularly, paid. Last year, former WA police minister Michelle Roberts told parliament rewards are \u201coften offered, but they are rarely given out\u201d.\nAccording to NSW police, the number of payouts is not an appropriate measure of success. \u201cFor investigators, success is solving a crime and providing answers to families,\u201d NSW police said in a statement.\nHowever, the public does not often hear of those who do collect rewards. \u201cThe police keep it very close to their chest,\u201d Rolfe says, adding that across his years of advocacy, he has never met anyone who received a reward.\nDr Goldsworthy put it this way: \u201cYou don\u2019t see too many lotto winners putting their face on TV.\u201d\n\u201cIf you\u2019re putting someone in for murder to collect a reward, and suddenly you\u2019re on TV popping the champagne going \u2018Yeah, I just got my million dollar reward\u2019, depending on the offender, you could be putting a real big target on your head,\u201d he says.\nAdditionally, he says, authorities don\u2019t want to create a norm where people expect money for reporting serious crimes.\nBut there are a handful of high profile examples.\nPaul Onions, who received a chunk of a $500,000 reward for helping to convict serial killer Ivan Milat, told the Herald Sun in 2010 he never cashed the cheque, handing the \u201chollow money\u201d back to the Australian High Commission in London.\nAnd an \u00a38,000 reward for the capture of the Kelly gang, posted in 1879, was divided among dozens of people after the dramatic siege at Glenrowan.\nAmong the recipients were numerous police officers, the schoolteacher Thomas Curnow, and seven Aboriginal trackers, named in the Police Reward Board report as Hero, Johnny, Jimmy, Jacky, Barny, Moses and Spider.\nBut the seven men never received their dues. The board decided it \u201cwould not be desirable to place any considerable sum of money in the hands of persons unable to use it\u201d and gave it to the Queensland and Victorian governments.\nA court battle to recover the lost money brought by two descendants ended in vain.\nMany families fight for years before a reward is posted.\nIn 1994 Sydney woman Revelle Balmain disappeared without a trace. Six months ago, police upped the reward on offer to $1m.\n\u201cIt took me 26 years to get my sister a million dollar reward,\u201d her sister Suellen Simpson tells Guardian Australia. Simpson believes it came too late, and wishes her stepfather and mother could have been alive to see it. She is no longer hopeful she will ever learn what happened to her sister.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what happened to Revelle, I don\u2019t know who was responsible. If [those who could provide information] were in their 40s [at the time of her disappearance], or a bit later, they could be on their way to 70. They might not even be around,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd this is the problem when things get left so long. You never find out.\u201d\nA reward may work out, or it may not, Dr Goldsworthy says, but at least it is there.\n\u201cYou just don\u2019t know who\u2019s going to come forward years down the track.\u201d",

        "content": "Dr Liz Bird, who has died of cancer aged 76, was a pioneering feminist academic. As head of continuing education and dean of arts at the University of Bristol, she was a key figure in the development of women\u2019s and gender studies both within the university\u2019s social science faculty and through community education.\nHer expertise spanned art history, cultural studies, sociology, feminism, film and theatre. Fondly remembered by mature students for her inspirational extramural programmes of part-time study, she encouraged many to go into further and higher education. A passionate commitment to feminism led her to join eight other academics (including myself) in preparing the first interdisciplinary textbook in the subject, Half the Sky: An Introduction to Women\u2019s Studies ( 1979) and later to carry out her own research into the history of women\u2019s studies. In 2000 she was appointed MBE for achievements in adult and continuing education.\nBorn in Gateshead, Liz was the daughter of Sybil (nee Grey), a barrister, and Robert Bird, the managing director of the family laundry firm. She was educated at Newcastle upon Tyne church high school (where she became head girl), then did a short cultural course at the University of Perugia before going to Oxford University to study philosophy, politics and economics, and Sussex University for an MA in the sociology of art and literature.\nA year at Cornell University, participating in radical politics (where she was referred to as \u201cthe redheaded English Bolshevik\u201d), was followed by a DPhil at Sussex University and research assistantship at Glasgow. In 1976, she moved to the University of Bristol to teach extramural studies, later becoming head of continuing education, before the department was closed down in 1998. Joining drama and theatre studies, Liz became dean of arts for six years until her retirement in 2004.\nShe then followed her lifelong passion for creative arts through an MA in contemporary printmaking at the University of the West of England in Bristol. She acquired a considerable reputation as a printmaker both in France (where she had a longstanding home) and south-west England. A keen supporter of the university\u2019s Theatre Collection, she recruited many volunteers to wrap the 20,000 glass-plate negatives of the photographer John Vickers\u2019 slides for its archive, providing tea and cake.\nAn enthusiastic commitment to collective cultural work brought her the friendship and admiration of hundreds of colleagues and students. Fearless and energetic, she stood up for women\u2019s rights through the Senate and the AUT union and fought for women\u2019s and gender courses against fierce opposition.\nLiz\u2019s personal kindness and down-to-earth generosity are recalled by everyone from porters and secretaries to vice-chancellors and senior staff. She was a loyal and imaginative friend to many, and a loving mother and grandmother.\nShe relished France and especially Breton culture, was a keen enthusiast of crime fiction, tennis and cricket, and spent her final months writing her memoir, setting up a new print exhibition, and watching Test matches and the US Open.\nShe met Brian McInally in 1971 at Prestwick airport. Their son, Francis, was born in 1981 and they married in Brittany in 2008. Liz is survived by Francis, two grandchildren, Sam and Iris, and her siblings, Michael and Victoria. Brian outlived her by less than three months.\n This article was amended on 31 January 2022. Between the online publication of this obituary on 17 November 2021 and its publication in the newspaper on 29 January 2022, Liz Bird\u2019s husband, Brian, also died. The piece was updated to reflect these events.",

        "content": "Talks expected to last into Saturday afternoon as delegates are told they must reach a deal or future generations will be forced into violent competition for resources\nChildren born today will be fighting each other for food and water in 2050 if the Cop26 climate summit fails, exhausted delegates were told as negotiators fight over the final details of a potential deal.\nThe deadline for the fortnight-long talks to finish came and went as leading figures took to the floor for what they hoped would be the final time, to exhort each other to cooperate in the interests of people threatened by the climate crisis around the world.\nAt stake is the world\u2019s chance of holding global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, the tougher of the two temperature goals in the 2015 Paris climate agreement and a \u201cplanetary boundary\u201d beyond which the ravages of climate breakdown will rapidly become catastrophic and irreversible.\nCop26 president Alok Sharma said a new draft would be published early on Saturday, after which it would be debated. Sharma said he anticipated the summit would finish on Saturday afternoon.\nEU vice-president Frans Timmermans said: \u201cIf we fail [my one-year-old grandson] will fight with other human beings for water and food. That\u2019s the stark reality we face. So 1.5C is about avoiding a future for our children and grandchildren that is unliveable.\u201d\nJohn Kerry, the US climate envoy, said: \u201cWe believe this is existential and, for many of you, existential today. People are dying today.\u201d\nThe head of delegation from Tuvalu, a Pacific island nation, was rousingly cheered when he warned that his country was sinking beneath the waves. Kenya\u2019s representative warned that heating of 1.5C on average around the world was likely to equate to 3C in many parts of Africa, a rise that would cause frequent heatwaves and devastating drought.\nEarlier on Friday, the UK as host nation of the talks circulated a second draft text for the outcome. This included a resolution for countries to start to phase out \u201cunabated\u201d coal power and \u201cinefficient\u201d fossil fuel subsidies, and a request for countries to return to the negotiating table next year to strengthen their national plans on cutting greenhouse gas emissions.\nWhether and how countries will revise those national plans \u2013 known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs) \u2013 is now at the heart of the talks. Research earlier this week by the Climate Action Tracker, an analyst organisation, found that current NDCs presented by countries in Glasgow would lead to at least 2.4C of heating, a disastrous level.\nSome countries have tried to argue that revising NDCs next year was contrary to the Paris agreement, which requires such revisions only every five years. However, the three architects of the Paris agreement \u2013 Laurent Fabius, the French foreign minister who presided over the talks; Laurence Tubiana, his chief diplomat; and Christiana Figueres, the UN climate chief at the time \u2013 told the Guardian the treaty allowed for a faster return and called on countries to come back to the negotiating table next year with revisions in line with 1.5C.\nThis provision for an amendment next year, currently paragraph 29 of the second draft outcome text, is likely to be one of the clauses most strenuously fought over in the closing stages. However, there are other outstanding problems, still the subject of frantic shuttle diplomacy by the UK\u2019s Cop president, cabinet minister Alok Sharma.\nThese sticking points include:\nDeveloping country concerns that their needs for finance to adapt to the impacts of the climate crisis are being overlooked. They want at least a doubling of the finance available for adaptation, and want to open up discussions on how to vastly increase the $100bn a year in climate finance, from public and private sources, that was promised them in 2009 for delivery from 2020, but which on current estimates will not be fulfilled until 2023.\nLoss and damage, the term for the impacts of the climate crisis too severe for countries to prepare for or adapt to them. The G77 + China bloc of developing nations \u2013 which represents 85% of humanity \u2013 are very unhappy about current plans for this subject, which they see as the compensation for climate disasters that rich nations have a moral duty to pay. The Guinea delegate, speaking for the bloc, wants the establishment of a \u201closs and damage facility\u201d, likely to mean an actual fund rather than a measure to work towards one.\nArticle 6 of the Paris agreement, which deals with carbon trading. Some countries want to use carbon offsetting to make up some of their commitments to reduce emissions, but others fear that the proposed rules would lead to a flood of cheap carbon credits that do not represent genuine emissions reductions.\nDisagreements over how countries should measure and report their greenhouse gas emissions. Known as the transparency and accountability provisions, these are also regarded as crucial because some countries are suspected of under-reporting their emissions.\nJennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace International, said the commitments on fossil fuels in the current text were too weak and should be strengthened. But she added: \u201cThere\u2019s wording in here worth holding on to and the UK presidency needs to fight tooth and nail to keep the most ambitious elements in the deal. We\u2019ve moved from richer nations largely ignoring the pleas of developing countries for promised finance to tackle climate change, to the beginnings of a recognition that their calls should be met. Now we need developed countries to scale up their offer of support and finance.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cNegotiators in Glasgow simply have to seize the moment and agree something historic, but they need to isolate the governments who\u2019ve come here to wreck progress and instead listen to the calls of youth and vulnerable nations.\u201d\nTracy Carty, head of Oxfam\u2019s Cop26 delegation, said: \u201cEmission reduction targets over the next decade have us careering towards climate catastrophe. We need an unambiguous deal in Glasgow that commits governments to coming back next year, and every year after that, with improved targets that will keep the goal of 1.5 degrees alive. This is the final countdown. Negotiators should come back to the table armed with commitments that are equal to the challenge that millions of people around the world are facing every day.\u201d\nTasneem Essop, executive director of the Climate Action Network, said it was essential that Cop produced concrete decisions to alleviate the suffering of millions of people worldwide coping with the double impacts of Covid and climate breakdown.\n\u201cWe will continue fighting for this because this is the litmus test for the success of Cop26,\u201d she said.",

        "content": "The modelling was delayed until the final Friday of COP26 to avoid embarrassment. But it\u2019s even worse than expected\n\nIn April this year, Australia\u2019s prime minister, Scott Morrison, said that \u201cwe will not achieve net zero in the cafes, dinner parties and wine bars of our inner cities\u201d. This explains why he turned to the salt-of-the-Earth hard-workin\u2019 rural folk at McKinsey \u2013 one of the biggest billion-dollar multinational consulting agencies on the planet \u2013 to produce the Australian government\u2019s long-awaited modelling explaining the pathway to \u201cnet zero by 2050\u201d.\nIn some parallel universe, the task may have gone to Australia\u2019s chief science agency, the CSIRO (a former employer of mine). But it was revealed at Senate estimates a few weeks back that despite the CSIRO applying for the tender, the government rejected them and paid McKinsey $6m to model the changes Australian society must go through to decarbonise within 30 years. This choice makes sense in the context of recent leaks to the New York Times that revealed McKinsey has advised 43 of the 100 biggest corporate polluters, including \u201cBP, Exxon Mobil, Gazprom and Saudi Aramco\u201d. 1,100 of its employees signed an open letter pleading the consultancy reveal the carbon impacts of its clients.\nWe\u2019ll never know exactly what the Australian government asked of the agency, but we finally know what got spat out the other end: an extremely weird document blatantly designed to protect the interests of Australia\u2019s fossil fuel industries while creating the illusion of ambitious climate action. It was delayed until the final Friday of Cop26 to avoid embarrassment during the global deliberations, so we knew it\u2019d be bad. But it\u2019s worse than expected.\nEarlier this year, I published a collection of predictions on what tricks and loopholes the Morrison government would use to announce a net zero target while changing nothing of Australia\u2019s climate policies and emissions.\nSome, I was right about. The government is indeed \u201cbackloading\u201d its climate action. This means putting off action until after 2030 and 2040, and changing nothing in the short term.\nThe government is also, as expected, relying heavily on \u201coffsets\u201d. This involves justifying greenhouse gas emissions on the grounds some other purchased service \u201ccancels\u201d them out. This can be the active removal of carbon from the atmosphere (the least bad option), or, ludicrously, the avoidance of emissions (such as a farmer choosing not to clear land). In McKinsey\u2019s modelling, these offsets are cheap as chips because they\u2019re mostly low-quality offsets like avoided emissions or carbon stored temporarily in trees and soil. It also entails the creation and participation in international carbon markets. This is the deeply problematic \u201cnet\u201d in \u201cnet zero\u201d, and it\u2019s a growing problem both in Australia and around the world.\nIf you want an idea of just how you should feel about offsets, imagine for a second if Morrison proposed dealing with the threat of Covid-19 by paying people in New Zealand to stay at home when they want to go out, and justifying an absence of restrictions in Australia on those grounds. It\u2019s raw madness in any other context, but somehow, in climate, we\u2019ve been bullied into treating it as normality.\nHere\u2019s what I didn\u2019t predict: of the various pathways modelled in this document, Australia\u2019s government picked the one that doesn\u2019t even reach net zero by 2050. Their preferred scenario, \u201cThe Plan\u201d, hits 2050 with a whopping 94 megatonnes of emissions remaining, or 215 if you exclude questionable offsets. They reached the point of 85% reduction in emissions, and very simply gave up. This ignored 15% is breezily labelled \u201cfurther technology breakthroughs\u201d in the document. It\u2019s both amusingly honest and stunningly irresponsible.\nAs RenewEconomy\u2019s Michael Mazengarb pointed out on Twitter, they also modelled a scenario in which emissions reductions go all the way to zero, albeit also reliant on offsets. That has a near-zero impact on economic growth, but it\u2019s explicitly dismissed because this scenario also results in worse outcomes for the coal and gas mining industries.\nCoal and gas sent overseas is responsible for roughly three times Australia\u2019s annual domestic emissions. If the 72 coal projects and 44 oil and gas projects in Australia are realised, this will become six times Australia\u2019s domestic emissions. They won\u2019t all be realised, but you get an idea of their wide-eyed fantasies of growth. It\u2019s this massive engine of planetary warming that the net zero plan ring-fences. Snarling at threats to fossil fuel companies feels like the only imperative this document takes seriously.\nThere is a reserved concession to the possibility that the coal export industry may shrink, with one graphic showing future coal exports dropping by 50%, by 2050. But in the same chart, gas exports increase by 13%. Both are laughable, considering the International Energy Agency\u2019s \u201cnet zero by 2050\u201d global scenario sees the total global consumption of both coal and gas drop to near-zero by 2050.\nPart of why this discrepancy exists is that the IEA\u2019s net zero scenario is limiting warming to 1.5C, but the government is targeting 2C, which allows for worse emissions into the future at the cost of more severe and catastrophic impacts of warming, particularly in the Global South. In fact 1.5C is not mentioned a single time in the hundreds of pages of the report. Like the 85%, it just breezily gives up part-way there.\nFundamentally, what McKinsey has laid out for us is that if you take the laziest, slowest and most bad-faith approach to climate action, it\u2019s very cheap and not immediately disruptive. Take credit for technological advancements that occur in other countries, continue extracting and emitting in the interim, and slap it all with a counterfeit climate action label to avoid scrutiny. Being a tech free rider while worsening the problem you claim to be solving is a wonderfully tempting climate philosophy.\nOf course, McKinsey\u2019s modelling buries an important caveat in the guts of the PDF: the physical consequences of climate change are not included in their modelling. That means they count the benefits of falling back to slower action and worse emissions, and ignore the consequences.\nIn reality, we cannot ignore the consequences. Climate change is a physical problem in which the accumulation of greenhouse gases heats our habitat and hurts us, very badly. A tower of greasy tricks deployed to protect the fossil fuel industry changes nothing about the laws of atmospheric physics, and the pain we experience when governments don\u2019t act fast enough.\nAustralia is not alone in exploiting the void between shiny promises and the hard realities of immediate, substantial change. The Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit\u2019s \u201cNet Zero Tracker\u201d outlines in great detail the unnerving gaps in the implementation of net zero targets. Several analyses of promises at Cop26 highlight the same.\nTruly, though, there is no country in the world that does climate delay quite like Australia. The hammy nationalism, the role of fantasy and trickery in its climate and energy rhetoric, and the total absence of shame in defending its role as a key cause of significant physical damage to Earth. It\u2019s only going to escalate as the next federal election inches closer. Better strap in: it\u2019s going to get even weirder.",

        "content": "Gunners will be favourites on Saturday but Tottenham have long-term plans for success under Rehanne Skinner\nWhen Tottenham welcome Arsenal to the Hive on Saturday it would be easy to expect another walk in the park for the league leaders. The Gunners have an impressive record against their north London rivals, having beaten them on the three occasions the teams have met in the Women\u2019s Super League, with an aggregate score of 11-1.\nIn the opening fixture of Women\u2019s Football Weekend, Arsenal are still firm favourites as the only team yet to drop a point after six games. However, Tottenham\u2019s impressive form has caught the eye. Spurs sit third, five points behind their opponents, and under the former England assistant coach Rehanne Skinner have been turned into a team that know how to utilise the sum of their parts.\n\u201cThey\u2019re a well-organised team that are consistent in the way they perform and in what they do,\u201d said Arsenal\u2019s manager, Jonas Eidevall, before reflecting on Tottenham\u2019s 1-1 draw at home to Manchester United last Sunday. \u201cYou could see in the game against United, they kept believing, they kept doing the same things over and over again. And that\u2019s usually a very good way to take points or win football matches. They have a clear identity and players who believe in it.\u201d\nSkinner arrived after the sacking of the widely respected management duo of Karen Hills and Juan Carlos Amoros, who had guided the team into the top flight. There was a feeling that the club were short-sighted, putting short-term gain ahead of the patient work that had allowed the side to climb steadily up the leagues. The recruitment of the US superstar Alex Morgan, making her return after pregnancy with her daughter Charlie, at the start of last season added to a feeling that Spurs wanted to accelerate the pace of their drive to the top.\nHowever, with Morgan returned to the NWSL and Skinner in the door, that has changed. There was smart recruitment over shiny big-name signings. Players with WSL experience and young talent such as Asmita Ale and Eleanor Heeps were added. The squad was balanced.\nA win over Manchester City in their second game and the draw with United speak to the growth under a manager approaching her first anniversary at the club. Breaking the grip of City, Chelsea and Arsenal on the top three spots will not be easy. United went closest last term and Everton have overhauled their squad in an attempt to challenge. But when trying to compete with such long-established clubs upheaval is not necessarily advantageous.\n\u201cIt takes time to build a squad,\u201d Skinner says. \u201cIt takes you time to make sure you understand what the direction of travel is of the league, because it\u2019s not just about the players here and now \u2013 you\u2019re trying to build for the way that the game is going to actually change.\n\u201cIn the year where we had a lot of Americans coming into the league, for example, the expectation probably wasn\u2019t that they were going to influence the league as much as they did. Sometimes you end up playing a bit of catch-up, but we\u2019re just trying to make sure that we set our stall out for what we want to try and be about as a team, and how we feel that\u2019s going to build us into games and build us into this league.\u201d\nWhat matters is time, but patience is in increasingly short supply. Clubs want to see a return on investments, whether that return be financial or sporting. With more and more teams investing to break through into the top three, measuring success on the basis of league position becomes increasingly hard.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not under any illusions that [getting into the top three] is going to happen overnight,\u201d Skinner says. \u201cThose top three have been in this game and in this league for a long, long time and it\u2019s a building process. We obviously all want to try and bridge the gap as fast as possible but it is going to take time.\u201d\nHow then does the manager and do the players manage their expectations and those of fans and directors? \u201cI think the biggest, most important thing for us is our honesty and openness around where we are and what we\u2019re trying to achieve,\u201d says Skinner. \u201cHopefully the fans can see that there\u2019s been progress and be on board with the fact that you don\u2019t get that overnight. It\u2019s really difficult.\n\u201cIf we\u2019re making statements that we can\u2019t live up to, that creates a challenge. But we\u2019re being really open about the fact that this is a journey. Hopefully if we can keep evolving what that experience is like for our fans, there\u2019s enough within there that they can see there\u2019s progress and they want to back us and they want to support us for the longer term.\u201d",

        "content": "\u2018Lapsed Liberals\u2019 and grassroots community groups are fielding high-profile candidates. Their target: the balance of power in Australia\u2019s 2022 election\nAt the last federal election, the Coalition faced challenges from a string of hopeful independents in rural and city seats, largely running on climate issues. With two exceptions \u2013 Zali Steggall in Warringah and Helen Haines in Indi \u2013 they came up short.\nNext year the independents will be back for another shot, focusing on heartland Coalition seats in New South Wales and Victoria. The difference this time is there is a road-tested model of how to mobilise the local community and run a campaign, and a $3.6m war chest on offer from Climate 200, a group established by the climate activist Simon Holmes \u00e0 Court.\nInspired by Steggall, Haines and her predecessor in Indi, Cathy McGowan, \u201cVoices of\u201d or \u201cVoices 4\u201d community groups have proliferated, turbocharged by the Liberals\u2019 slowness in adopting a net zero target for 2050 and the rolling scandals in federal politics.\nWill the outcome be different this time?\n\u201cWe are at an inflection point,\u201d Holmes \u00e0 Court says. \u201cA lot of the services provided by a major party are not needed to run a campaign any more.\u201d\nHe points to the success of online meetings, crowdfunding and social media to spread the word and organise. Climate 200 offers to add large-scale fundraising, legal and political support, polling and campaign strategy.\nThis time around the target is not a just an independent voice in parliament but the balance of power. If independents threaten to make serious inroads the Coalition will face a nightmare scenario as it simultaneously defends a raft of marginal electorates from Labor in Queensland, western Sydney and Western Australia.\nThe Coalition now has 76 seats in the 151-seat parliament. Labor needs to win eight seats to govern in its own right.\n\u201cIf we can just win two or three seats it\u2019s highly likely there will be a minority government,\u201d Holmes \u00e0 Court says. \u201cWe will be back in the situation in 2010, where the independents will have a tough decision to make and, whichever way they go, they will give the government of the day the backbone to deal with the issues we care about.\u201d\nThere are many seats with \u201cVoices of\u201d groups, but among the main ones to watch are five in Sydney \u2013 Warringah, Wentworth, Mackellar, North Sydney and Hughes \u2013 and three in Melbourne \u2013 Kooyong, Goldstein and Flinders \u2013 as well as Hume in regional NSW and Indi and Nicholls in regional Victoria.\nAction on the climate emergency remains the No 1 issue for the community-based groups, followed closely by concerns about integrity in politics and the lack of gender diversity.\nMPs facing independent challenges including Jason Falinski in Mackellar and Tim Wilson in Goldstein have dismissed the Voices movements as simply Labor and Greens supporters masquerading as independents and point out that that they have sprung up only in conservative seats.\nBut Falinski acknowledges they are a threat. \u201cAny group that is well-funded by big tech billionaires and trust fund kids from Sydney\u2019s eastern suburbs or inner Melbourne you have to take seriously,\u201d he says.\n\u201cBut when it comes to ideas, policy and serving the community it is a lot less clear what alternative they are providing. And even less clear what they can action once in parliament.\u201d\nBut Holmes \u00e0 Court says the impetus for the groups comes from the grassroots.\n\u201cWe are not starting any campaigns, we are helping to turbocharge them. They rise up in seats where people feel very strongly they are being misrepresented.\u201d\nSome local Liberals, including the MP for the NSW state seat of Pittwater, Rob Stokes, have engaged with Voices of Mackellar, perhaps wary that the 1,000 people who have attended its events are ignored at their peril.\nAnne Capling, a retired professor of politics from Melbourne University, who is spearheading the campaign for an independent in Kooyong, says Labor has already faced one watershed moment among its supporters, losing voters in the 1990s and 2000s to the Greens on the left and to One Nation on the right.\n\u201cI think the same thing is happening to the Liberals. Progressive voters are looking at independents. On the right, the Liberals are still tethered to the Nationals and the Christian right is gaining traction in the party.\u201d\nUndeterred that the previous independent, Kerryn Phelps, failed to hold the seat by about 2,300 votes in 2019, a group of wealthy citizens have been working for months to recruit the ideal candidate to connect with the progressive voters of Wentworth, formerly held by Malcolm Turnbull \u2013 now one of Scott Morrison\u2019s fiercest critics on climate.\nIt\u2019s believed the group have identified a candidate \u2013 someone with deep roots in Sydney\u2019s eastern suburbs and the pizazz of Steggall \u2013 to be announced before Christmas.\nThey have an office and staff, and have already amassed close to $500,000.\n\u201cOur biggest issue is that the Liberal party no longer represents this community,\u201d says Lyndell Droga, spokesperson for Wentworth Independents. \u201cBoth parties lack the ambition required on climate change to really set up Wentworth and Australia for the new economic opportunities.\u201d\nThe MP, Dave Sharma, is on the moderate wing of his party, as are most of the other Liberals in seats targeted by independents.\nSharma led the charge to nudge the party towards a more ambitious emissions target for 2030. In a speech at the University of NSW in September, he called for it to commit to 40% to 45% reductionby 2035. But, as Droga points out, nothing has happened.\n\u201cEven when the local member advocates for modest action on climate policy, he is quite clearly ignored. It is quite clear to us now that a vote for the Liberal party in Wentworth is simply giving the casting vote on climate change to Barnaby Joyce and the National party.\n\u201cWe believe that, with the right candidate, we will give the people of Wentworth a genuine choice of someone who reflects their values.\u201d\nSharma declined to comment.\nThe Liberals have searched for a star candidate to unseat Steggall in Warringah but so far have come up empty-handed.\nThe barrister Jane Buncle is said to be the current frontrunner but, with preselections still to be held, the launch ramp for an unknown Liberal is short and Steggall\u2019s profile is high.\nThe mood of optimism for independent campaigns has infected neighbouring seats.\nKylea Tink has announced her candidacy in Trent Zimmerman\u2019s seat of North Sydney, supported by a strong local campaign machine and Climate 200. In Mackellar, on the northern peninsula, the search is on for a candidate.\nAnyo Geddes of Mackellar Rising says \u201cincredible people at the peak of their careers\u201d have offered to stand.\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that the so-called [Liberal] \u2018moderates\u2019 are impotent, particularly against the influence of Barnaby Joyce,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge trust deficit with our local member saying one thing, then voting the same way as the Nationals and the right faction within his party.\u201d\nOne local issue is also proving potent \u2013 whether the government will formally extinguish the petroleum exploration licence PEP-11, which extends offshore from Newcastle to Wollongong. The licence is about to expire, but so far the minister responsible, the Nationals\u2019 Keith Pitt, has not acted, prompting a ferocious campaign on the northern beaches.\nFalinski says PEP-11 is \u201cdead in the water\u201d and that Steggall\u2019s bill to kill it off risks opening the federal government to compensation claims.\n\u201cNo one has been stronger in the opposition to PEP-11 than I have,\u201d he says. \u201cI have been critical of the minister, the permit holder and the Labor government who introduced this in 1999.\u201d\nBut Geddes says there is \u201cenormous demand\u201d to shut down the licence for good.\n\u201cPep-11 is clearly a bargaining tool that Keith Pitt is holding onto in the same way that the Nationals held the Scott Morrison to ransom over setting a 2050 target,\u201d she says.\nThe latest independent threatening a rural National party seat is Greater Shepparton\u2019s deputy mayor, Rob Priestly \u2013 he owns a string of dry-cleaning businesses \u2013 who is running for the regional Victorian seat of Nicholls.\nThe area has experienced independent representation at state level \u2013 and the renewed attention it brings from the major parties \u2013 after Suzanna Sheed\u2019s win in 2014.\nDamian Drum has held Nicholls since 2016 with a healthy 20% margin, making it one of the safest seats in Australia. But there are rumours that he may retire, and it is understood Priestly was sounded out by the Nationals before he decided to run as an independent.\nDeep fissures between the Victorian and Queensland Nats have been exacerbated by the debate about emissions.\n\u201cBarnaby Joyce is not liked in this part of the world,\u201d Priestly says. \u201cThis is a conservative seat but they are also serious about climate change \u2026\n\u201cFarmers in this electorate know that the climate is changing. Our food processors know we need a meaningful climate and energy policy for the future, not something dusted off from the 1950s, and setting the target is not enough.\u201d\nSue Barrett of Voices of Goldstein says the group has about 1,000 people on its database and more than 200 volunteers. It is close to choosing its candidate, likely to be a high-profile woman.\nGoldstein, based around the bayside suburb of Brighton, is held by the Liberal Tim Wilson, who seems unfazed by the prospect of an independent challenger.\n\u201cThey\u2019re just the same faces who turn out at elections wearing a green or red T-shirt, and now they\u2019re wearing purple looking for a puppet candidate to pretend they\u2019re independent,\u201d he says.\nThe result, he says, will be a sharp decline in the vote for the Greens and Labor, pushing down their electoral funding and their Senate vote \u2013 \u201cso I wish them well in that endeavour\u201d.\nWilson says potential candidates have been \u201cshocked that they have to sign up to a rigid policy platform that would mean they\u2019d just be a puppet\u201d.\nThis is strongly disputed by Barrett, who says potential candidates are asked to commit to advancing the group\u2019s two main goals \u2013 action on climate change and integrity in politics \u2013 as well as a more general statement on promoting social cohesion and economic prosperity.\nThey are also asked sign the politicians\u2019 pledge drafted by the St James Ethics Centre, which sets out an ethical framework for elected representatives.\n\u201cWe certainly have not said we would dictate policies \u2013 we are not a party. But to receive our endorsement, they must support the two key areas that our supporters have identified as important to them.\u201d\nIn the seat held by the treasurer, Josh Fydenberg, the Kooyong Independents have advertised for a candidate in the Age and the Australian Financial Review.\nClimate 200 polling by Community Engagement in October had the Liberals comfortably ahead with 34.4% of first preferences, compared with just 7.5% for an independent and 13.5% for the Greens. But with a notional candidate of the calibre of Steggall or Haines, the independent vote rocketed up to 26.3%, while the Liberal vote fell to 25.9%.\nHolmes \u00e0 Court, who lives in Kooyong, says: \u201cThe people who are most passionate here are the lapsed Liberals.\u201d\nWilson, whose seat showed a similar trend, says the polling is \u201crubbish\u201d and \u201cdesigned to assist Climate 200\u2019s fundraising\u201d.\nIndependents are also planning to run in Hume, the seat of the energy minister, Angus Taylor. Penny Ackery, a special education teacher from Goulburn, was announced as a candidate on Saturday at Goulburn showgrounds.\nThe nature of the seat makes the task harder: it stretches from Sydney\u2019s outer fringe to Bowral and Mittagong, which are increasingly home to retirees and tree changers, and through to prime National party territory around Goulburn.\nHughes, the southern Sydney seat held by Craig Kelly, who defected from the Liberals to the Palmer United party, is set to face a messy multi-horse race.\nAs well as Labor, Liberals and Kelly, there will be two independents spawned by the community group We Are Hughes.\nThe corporate lawyer Georgia Steele has already announced her candidacy and another member of the group is expected to stand.\nSo what does it mean for the Liberals if independents sweep out some of its most prominent moderates?\nHolmes \u00e0 Court says the long-term effect would be positive.\n\u201cThe Liberal party might lose three MPs who say they care about climate change but who have delivered nothing in the last three years. The price for that is the Coalition will spend a few years in the wilderness, re-evaluating their opposition in dealing with these issues.\u201d",

        "content": "Forbes in NSW and Bairnsdale in Victoria among the areas on flood alert as SES responds to hundreds of calls for help\nDays of heavy rain across south-eastern Australia have caused rivers to surge and break their banks, flooding swathes of New South Wales and Victoria.\nThe focus in NSW had turned to areas around the Lachlan River, with major flood warnings issued for Forbes and Nanami, where the State Emergency Service was assisting with sandbagging.\nThe SES said it had responded to more than 280 calls for assistance, with the busiest areas being around Armidale, Bathurst and Orange, the latter two of which had more than 90mm each over three days. It had also made 21 flood rescues statewide, about half of which were cars stuck in flood waters.\nSince the weather event began, the SES had responded to nearly 800 calls for assistance.\nSenior hydrologist Alex Clifton said the river rises at Forbes were \u201cpretty significant\u201d, as the town braces for flash flooding.\n\u201cThe major impacts that we\u2019re seeing at the moment are in the Lachlan River Valley,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThere is major flooding that\u2019s likely to occur later today at Nanami and major flooding that we\u2019re forecasting for Forbes and Cotton\u2019s Weir, which is downstream, from Monday.\u201d\nThere were 12 flood warnings in place across the state, including for the Lachlan, Macquarie, Belubula, Gwydir and Castlereagh rivers, after some areas were lashed by up to 200mm of rain since Thursday.\nThe Macquarie river peaked at just above five metres by 9pm on Friday, while a peak of more than 12 metres had been recorded at the Lachlan River.\nThe Bureau of Meteorology had forecast major flooding at the Lachlan River, with the flood peak currently at Cowra and expected to reach Nanami on Saturday night.\nThe #rain may have eased over most of #NSW, and the sun may even be out, but there are still #flood warnings current as the runoff from the recent rain moves through some river catchments. Make sure to check the latest warnings for your area: https://t.co/QRI6KvMRp4 @NSWSES pic.twitter.com/VS2E6bwygT\nDamaging winds were also forecast for the northern tablelands in NSW, with gusts of more than 90km/h possible around elevated areas.\nMark Uebergang has seen the floods affect his farm in North Star, NSW, with wheat and grain winter crops both affected, although he said it was still too early to know the extent of the damage.\n\u201cWe\u2019re still seeing the extent of the flood\u2019s progress, we don\u2019t know how much it\u2019ll affect cropping land, but it has the potential of impacting many thousands of acres of winter crop ready for harvest.\n\u201cWe\u2019re just waiting for it to dry out to continue our harvests, and to see what damage the rainfall has done in terms of grading the quality of the crops.

        "content": "Deadlock stretched climate summit past its scheduled end with hopes leaders will reach agreement by Saturday\nCop26 climate talks were closing in on a global deal aimed at limiting devastating global warming, with UK organisers hoping for a final agreement to the marathon negotiations on Saturday.\nDelegates from nearly 200 nations are tasked with keeping alive the 2015 Paris goal of limiting temperature rises to 1.5C, as warming-driven disasters hit home around the world.\nDeveloping economies led by India have balked at demands to do more to curb emissions without financial support to transition away from fossil fuels and to adapt to the accelerating impacts of climate change.\nThe deadline for the fortnight-long talks to finish came and went as leading figures took to the floor for what they hoped would be the final time, to exhort each other to cooperate in the interests of people threatened by the climate crisis around the world.\nSummit organisers confirmed that a new draft text would not be published for scrutiny until early Saturday in Glasgow.\n\u201cI envisage formal plenary meetings in the afternoon to adopt decisions and close the session on Saturday,\u201d said the Cop26 president, Alok Sharma.\nThe EU commission vice-president, Frans Timmermans, said: \u201cIf we fail [my one-year-old grandson] will fight with other human beings for water and food. That\u2019s the stark reality we face. So 1.5C is about avoiding a future for our children and grandchildren that is unliveable.\u201d\nJohn Kerry, the US climate envoy, said: \u201cWe believe this is existential and, for many of you, existential today. People are dying today.\u201d\nThe head of delegation from Tuvalu, a Pacific island nation, was rousingly cheered when he warned that his country was sinking beneath the waves. Kenya\u2019s representative warned that heating of 1.5C on average around the world was likely to equate to 3C in many parts of Africa, a rise that would cause frequent heatwaves and devastating drought.\nEarlier on Friday, the UK as host nation of the talks circulated a second draft text for the outcome. This included a resolution for countries to start to phase out \u201cunabated\u201d coal power and \u201cinefficient\u201d fossil fuel subsidies, and a request for countries to return to the negotiating table next year to strengthen their national plans on cutting greenhouse gas emissions.\nWhether and how countries will revise those national plans \u2013 known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs) \u2013 is now at the heart of the talks. Research earlier this week by the Climate Action Tracker, an analyst organisation, found that current NDCs presented by countries in Glasgow would lead to at least 2.4C of heating, a disastrous level.\nSome countries have tried to argue that revising NDCs next year was contrary to the Paris agreement, which requires such revisions only every five years. However, the three architects of the Paris agreement \u2013 Laurent Fabius, the French foreign minister who presided over the talks; Laurence Tubiana, his chief diplomat; and Christiana Figueres, the UN climate chief at the time \u2013 told the Guardian the treaty allowed for a faster return and called on countries to come back to the negotiating table next year with revisions in line with 1.5C.\nThis provision for an amendment next year, currently paragraph 29 of the second draft outcome text, is likely to be one of the clauses most strenuously fought over in the closing stages. However, there are other outstanding problems, still the subject of frantic shuttle diplomacy by Sharma.\nThese sticking points include:\nDeveloping country concerns that their needs for finance to adapt to the impacts of the climate crisis are being overlooked. They want at least a doubling of the finance available for adaptation, and want to open up discussions on how to vastly increase the $100bn a year in climate finance, from public and private sources, that was promised them in 2009 for delivery from 2020, but which on current estimates will not be fulfilled until 2023.\nLoss and damage, the term for the impacts of the climate crisis too severe for countries to prepare for or adapt to them. The G77-plus-China bloc of developing nations \u2013 which represents 85% of humanity \u2013 are very unhappy about current plans for this subject, which they see as the compensation for climate disasters that rich nations have a moral duty to pay. The Guinea delegate, speaking for the bloc, wants the establishment of a \u201closs and damage facility\u201d, likely to mean an actual fund rather than a measure to work towards one.\nArticle 6 of the Paris agreement, which deals with carbon trading. Some countries want to use carbon offsetting to make up some of their commitments to reduce emissions, but others fear that the proposed rules would lead to a flood of cheap carbon credits that do not represent genuine emissions reductions.\nDisagreements over how countries should measure and report their greenhouse gas emissions. Known as the transparency and accountability provisions, these are also regarded as crucial because some countries are suspected of under-reporting their emissions.\nJennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace International, said the commitments on fossil fuels in the current text were too weak and should be strengthened. But she added: \u201cThere\u2019s wording in here worth holding on to and the UK presidency needs to fight tooth and nail to keep the most ambitious elements in the deal. We\u2019ve moved from richer nations largely ignoring the pleas of developing countries for promised finance to tackle climate change, to the beginnings of a recognition that their calls should be met. Now we need developed countries to scale up their offer of support and finance.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cNegotiators in Glasgow simply have to seize the moment and agree something historic, but they need to isolate the governments who\u2019ve come here to wreck progress and instead listen to the calls of youth and vulnerable nations.\u201d\nTracy Carty, head of Oxfam\u2019s Cop26 delegation, said: \u201cEmission reduction targets over the next decade have us careering towards climate catastrophe. We need an unambiguous deal in Glasgow that commits governments to coming back next year, and every year after that, with improved targets that will keep the goal of 1.5 degrees alive. This is the final countdown. Negotiators should come back to the table armed with commitments that are equal to the challenge that millions of people around the world are facing every day.\u201d\nTasneem Essop, executive director of the Climate Action Network, said it was essential that Cop produced concrete decisions to alleviate the suffering of millions of people worldwide coping with the double impacts of Covid and climate breakdown.\n\u201cWe will continue fighting for this because this is the litmus test for the success of Cop26,\u201d she said.",

        "content": "Planting trees to offset carbon emissions sounds great, but where are we going to put them all? \nAs the United Nations Cop26 climate conference in Glasgow winds down, many world leaders and corporate boards are embracing an increasingly popular idea to solve climate change: trees.\nThe United Arab Emirates \u2013 one of the biggest oil producers in the world \u2013 promised to plant 100m mangroves by 2030. India said it aims to plant enough trees to cover a third of its land area with forests. Earlier this month the Amazon founder, Jeff Bezos, announced a $1bn fund towards planting trees, \u201crevitalizing\u201d grasslands in Africa and restoring landscapes across the US. And at the start of the conference, more than 100 countries pledged to halt and reverse deforestation by 2030. \u201cThese great teeming ecosystems \u2013 these cathedrals of nature \u2013 are the lungs of our planet,\u201d Boris Johnson said, exalting the effort.\nTrees and forests, which absorb carbon dioxide, are indeed crucial to slowing global heating.\nBut environmental groups and climate change researchers say there\u2019s a serious problem with overrelying on such pledges: there just isn\u2019t enough land on Earth to plant enough trees to soak up all the carbon that big polluters keep spewing into the atmosphere.\nTo achieve \u201cnet zero\u201d by 2050 using \u201cland-based\u201d carbon removal methods \u2013 a category that includes tree-planting, reforestation projects and land management techniques that help lock more carbon in soil \u2013 \u201cwould require at least 1.6bn hectares of new forests, equivalent to five times the size of India or more than all the farmland on the planet\u201d, a recent analysis by Oxfam found.\nThe oil company Shell would need to use 28.6m hectares (70.7m acres) of land \u2013 an area roughly the size of Italy \u2013 to offset 35% of its emissions by 2050 using such techniques, the report found. Ethiopia would need to use 50\u201360% of its land to meet current offset goals, Switzerland could need more than 830,000 hectares, and the EU could need up to 90m hectares.\n\u201cNature and land-based carbon removal schemes are an important part of the mix of efforts needed to stop global emissions, but they must be pursued in a much more cautious way,\u201d said Nafkote Dabi, the climate change lead for Oxfam International.\nThe idea of harnessing trees to solve the global climate crisis has long been appealing. In the US, tree-planting schemes have broad, bipartisan support, with 90% of Americans favoring planting about a trillion trees around the world to absorb carbon emissions, according to a 2020 Pew survey. As Mark Benioff, the billionaire CEO of Salesforce, put it last year after promising funds to plant 100m of them: \u201cNobody is against trees.\u201d\nThe growing enthusiasm for such planting schemes was bolstered by a 2019 study in Science, which estimated that 900m hectares of available land around the world could hold more than a trillion more trees, which could be harnessed in the fight against global heating.\nBut critics soon pointed out that the study made flawed assumptions about what land was \u201cavailable\u201d for tree planting, how many trees that land could hold, and how much carbon those trees could take in. The journal published five responses outlining concerns, one of which concluded: \u201cThe emerging global political myth of massive tree planting and restoration as a panacea for global warming requires an unrealistically large area\u201d \u2013 far more than the study suggested.\nAt worst, tree planting schemes \u2013 beyond being ineffectual \u2013 can harm or displace vulnerable communities. In Pakistan, a \u201cBillion Tree Tsunami\u201d project launched in 2014 destroyed the pasturing lands of nomadic Gujjar goat-herders. \u201cConservation appears to be promoting further marginalization,\u201d wrote Usman Ashraf, a political ecologist who documented the impacts of the project in Pakistan\u2019s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.\nAs the zeal for tree planting projects grows, so does the backlash against them. Last week, Indigenous activists at Cop26 called carbon offset schemes \u201ca new form of colonialism\u201d. And before walking out of a conference event on offsets, activist Greta Thunberg urged attendees: \u201cStop greenwashing.\u201d",

And the opportunity is to set standards which will set an example elsewhere in the world.\n\u201cUnderlying all of these is something bigger: a rejection of the dismal idea that politics is simply a gravy train for the self-interested.\u201d\nThe Labour interventions come after a cross-party parliamentary group also called for the register of overseas entities to be set up. The parliamentary group on fair business banking, including more than a dozen Tory MPs and peers, has written to Boris Johnson urging action.\n\u201cEconomic crime and illicit finance in the UK funds organised crime, terrorists and other malicious actors; undermines good governance and faith in our economy; and tarnishes our global reputation,\u201d it said.\nThe National Crime Agency estimates that the total cost to the UK economy of money laundering a year is about \u00a3100bn.\nMoves to create the register of property owners followed repeated calls for action to be taken, including a 2015 speech where David Cameron pledged there would be \u201cno place for dirty money in Britain\u201d.",

Can I just bend your ear \u2026?\u2019 Absolutely not!\u201d he says. \u201cIt has happened quite a lot over the last year, most notably over the Owen Paterson case but also a couple of others. And in the past, my view has been: \u2018Right, I\u2019m just going to tell you you\u2019re not allowed to lobby.\u2019 My new version is: the moment anybody lobbies me I will simply report it to the commissioner and then the commissioner can decide what to do with it.\u201d\nThe commissioner, Kathryn Stone, investigates MPs\u2019 conduct. But it is Bryant\u2019s committee which then decides what sanctions they should face, with MPs given the final say \u2013 though this is usually a formality.\nSince Johnson\u2019s bid to clear Paterson opened the way to a maelstrom of allegations about MPs\u2019 financial interests, Bryant has found himself cast as the scourge of the government.\nThe Labour MP\u2019s coruscating speech in the Paterson debate was heard in a silence rare for the House of Commons, as he warned that if MPs followed Johnson\u2019s lead, Paterson\u2019s name would become a byword for wrongdoing.\nSpeaking to the Guardian from his Welsh constituency of Rhondda this week, he warned that MPs may now have to endure months of intense scrutiny. \u201cMy guess is that there\u2019ll be stories all the way through to Christmas,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd this angers me, because the government has led us all into this quagmire.\u201d\nBryant first came across Johnson at Oxford University in the 1980s when Johnson was president of the debating club the Oxford Union. \u201cWe were at university together. He\u2019s a bit younger than me,\u201d says Bryant, 59.\nHe only recalls coming across the mop-headed future prime minister on a couple of occasions but says his character was already clear. \u201cYou know, he was then almost exactly as he is now.\u201d\nAsked if he means Johnson took a relaxed attitude to rules, Bryant bristles. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s relaxed at all. It\u2019s quite the opposite of relaxed. I think he thinks he\u2019s Samson. He wants to pull the temple down on top of his head. And what is irritating I think, particularly for lots of Tories, in particular new Tories, is that they had no idea what deluge would come. And if you pull the building down on top of you, people tend to get hurt. Completely capriciously.\u201d\nThe biblical comparison perhaps comes naturally because Bryant was a vicar before becoming a politician. Despite his theological roots, he insists he never intended to set himself up as parliament\u2019s moral guardian, however.\n\u201cI do not think of myself as a saint. So I hate the idea of some kind of great witchfinder who\u2019s out there to snatch people into the back of my van,\u201d he says. \u201cI have as many clay feet as anybody else and I\u2019m not a judgmental person by nature.\u201d\nNevertheless, in his 20-year parliamentary career, he has often strayed into what he calls \u201cwarm water\u201d \u2013 setting himself against foes including the Kremlin and the Murdoch press. More recently, he graphically detailed his successful treatment for skin cancer.\nBryant rejects the word \u201csleaze\u201d, seeing it as an unhelpful catch-all. \u201cI don\u2019t like the word sleaze because it\u2019s so untargeted. You know, 20 years ago sleaze included just being gay.\u201d Bryant\u2019s civil partnership with Jared Cranney was the first same-sex relationship celebrated at the House of Commons, in 2010.\nRather than sleaze, Bryant believes it is conflicts of interest that damage the standing of parliament. \u201cIf people think that you are really not interested in serving the public and you\u2019re really only interested in serving some kind of commercial gain, then I think they look on that very ill,\u201d he says.\n\u201cAnd also then when it accumulates then people start to go: \u2018Hang on, it didn\u2019t pass the sniff test last week. Now there\u2019s a really sulphurous smell about the place.\u2019\u201d He says the \u201cvast majority\u201d of MPs have no conflict of interest but all are damaged by the perception that politicians are on the take.\nThe prime minister felt the need to insist this week that the UK is \u201cnot remotely a corrupt country\u201d. Bryant is less complacent. \u201cThere are clearly the first spots of corruption on the windscreen but, more importantly, the danger is we are corrupting,\u201d he says, pointing not only to the Paterson case but to the government\u2019s habit of doling out pots of money to handpicked constituencies. \u201cI don\u2019t like the levelling-up fund because basically it\u2019s ministers deciding where to award money, I think that will inevitably lead to corrupting \u2013 and every step that you take down that yellow brick road gets you further away from probity.\u201d\nSeveral ministers, including the chancellor Rishi Sunak, have acknowledged the government mishandled the Paterson affair \u2013 but Johnson has declined to apologise.\nWith a motion reinstating the verdict against Paterson coming before the Commons on Monday and expected to pass without a vote, Bryant says he would like ministers to set the record straight by endorsing his committee\u2019s report. \u201cI\u2019ve not heard a single government minister say that Owen Paterson was guilty, and that the sanction was suitable,\u201d he says.\nWith his committee expected to report within weeks on its review into MPs\u2019 code of conduct, Bryant is happily immersed in the detail of parliamentary rules. But he says that if Keir Starmer asked him to serve in the shadow cabinet, he would do so. \u201cIf anybody wants to offer me anything, I would, because in the end I want to change the world and the best way to change the world is through the Labour party. It\u2019s the only real engine of change we have \u2013 and that requires every shoulder to the wheel.\u201d",

Before this, I had never been one to put up my blinkers. I thought it dangerous and foolish to ignore bad news. Like many journalists, \u201ckeeping informed\u201d verged on compulsion, born out of professional obligation and fear of ignominy. But last summer I felt raw; fire-hosed by information and stimuli. I\u2019d wake up feeling terrified, before indulging in a bout of doomscrolling (the excessive consumption of bad or anxiety-inducing news online). I would find myself lost in unverified stories and furious hot takes on social media, leaving me drained of energy, yet too jittery to sit still.\nAt first, I thought it was my long-term anxiety, diagnosed in my late 20s but present since childhood, merely dialled up. But after I explained the curious combination of lethargy and fury to a perinatal psychiatrist \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m not sad, I\u2019m furious\u201d \u2013 I received a diagnosis of PND. There had been warning signs that I ignored, of course. A sliver of a maternity leave, insomnia for years, a wobble when I\u2019d had my first child the year before, a book deadline that hung over my newborn charge. Then my oldest friend lost her little boy and my trust in the world leaked away. I felt like a watered down person, with no conviction, or purpose. I was a book left in the sunshine too long: spine unglued and pages flying away. As I shrank smaller and smaller, the world loomed larger. I\u2019ve always been sensitive to noise, but now I felt electric: a forest fire, burning with shame and fear. If anyone so much as brushed past me, I almost threw up. I was convinced I was being watched. I was ashamed to be feeling so furious, so lost, so shattered. I had a wonderful life, I thought (furiously). Why couldn\u2019t I snap out of it? But it felt as if that life was trapped behind glass, and I was the taxidermied ferret, with a frozen rictus grin.\nThese were not ideal conditions in which to publicise a book. I have never felt more of a fraud than in those months when I made a cheery weekly podcast, or gabbed on a radio show about my new book. I knew I needed to find a way of shutting out the world as much as possible, while still being able to do my job. (As a freelance writer, taking a sabbatical or decent maternity leave never occurred to me.) The answer came to me suddenly, and all at once: banish bad news. I already switched off my phone regularly \u2013 installing a landline so that my mother could reach me instead of leaving me 48 voicemails in a row, at 10-minute intervals \u2013 but now I kept it turned off for days at a time, learning of \u201cbad\u201d news only when my husband or friends told me, or when I had to research something for work.\nInstead, I sniffed out positive news platforms like a bloodhound, replacing the hours I had previously spent reading newspapers surfing them instead: the Happy Newspaper, the Good News Movement, Upworthy, the Good News Network, Positive News, the Guardian\u2019s Upside. (Pleasingly, they all come as websites, too, meaning I didn\u2019t have to go on social media.) It was not, I soon discovered, a matter of one or two outlets \u2013 this was an entire good news movement. As I dived into them, it occurred to me to question the idea that only bad news is newsworthy. What if \u201cjoyscrolling\u201d \u2013 scrolling fervently through sites dedicated to uplifting or positive news \u2013 is just as important?\nIn the 60s, President Lyndon B Johnson complained about the lack of optimistic news in Time magazine to its publisher and editor, Henry Luce. Luce replied: \u201cMr President, good news isn\u2019t news. Bad news is news.\u201d A negative bias in the news is an evolutionary necessity. You needed to know the bad news (a bear outside your cave) in order to prepare and defend yourself. This is true of today, particularly during the pandemic, but many of us were hooked on the 24/7 news cycle, and reading urgent hourly bulletins late at night, long before Covid-19.\nIt is not the case that the news has got worse \u2013 given how subjective the idea of \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d news is, this is impossible to prove. The problem, according to behavioural and data scientist Pragya Agarwal, is more that we \u201cfind ourselves compelled, in a world of instant gratification and on-demand entertainment, to be informed of the news instantly\u201d . Critical reasoning takes time, which is why Twitter now asks, \u201cHave you read this article?\u201d before you retweet it. Every expert I speak to cites 2016 and \u201cthe fake news crisis\u201d as a key shift towards anxiety around news consumption. Where once we received our news from trusted sources \u2013 Agarwal says we attributed a \u201cstatus bias\u201d to news sources, simply because there were so few of them \u2013 many of us now receive it from unverified content producers, via social media. Getting your news from Facebook or TikTok, for instance, presents a further problem. As Pooja Lakshmin, a perinatal psychiatrist and founder of women\u2019s health platform Gemma, says: \u201cWhat does it mean to see the news in that same place that you also see memories and emotions?\u201d\nIt is not unusual to sidestep the news cycle during new motherhood, especially if you find you are depressed. \u201cI was so furious at the world when I had PND that I wanted no active part in it,\u201d says the writer Emma Jane Unsworth, whose memoir After the Storm explores her experience of PND. \u201cAvoidance felt like defiance. Being politically unaware made me feel like I was getting some kind of revenge.\u201d Postnatal depression soared in 2020 \u2013 research from UCL found that new mothers were more than twice as likely to experience it during the first lockdown than before the pandemic. Lakshmin encourages temporary, selective news consumption when you have a new baby, but also \u201cduring any extreme period of personal stress\u201d \u2013 such as grief or divorce \u2013 where you might \u201cfind yourself spiralling and struggling to self-regulate\u201d. She also stresses that disengagement should always be temporary.\nBut you don\u2019t need to be depressed to feel compelled to quit the 24/7 news cycle. The BBC noted that while there had been an initial hike in news broadcasting figures in March 2020 (even from gen Z, who typically eschew nightly TV news), they plunged back down again a month later, as people felt overwhelmed with information that was good and bad, but mainly uncertain. The two largest news stories of the last few years \u2013 coronavirus and the climate crisis \u2013 both remain unresolved, unpredictable and urgent. Uncertainty is even worse for you than bad news, according to neuroscientist Lisa Feldman Barrett. \u201cIt is not hyperbole for me to tell you that I think all this uncertainty is a serious public health issue,\u201d she says.\nSpeaking to friends, I realise that many of them are looking for, if not an escape, then a breather. They have secret joy rituals. Emily begins her day with videos of orcas, finding calm in their expansive inky blackness. Rosie watches videos of nuns on TikTok. Mary, a lawyer, and Andrew, a yoga instructor, have set up a side project called Hello Stranger, where they leave stamped blank postcards with Mary\u2019s address written on them, around London, with a small note at the top asking people to share some happy news. To date, they have left 500 postcards and received 300 back. For those of us who feel anxious when anything is left unresolved, simple acts of routine, or completion, can be a vital salve. A woman goes shopping. An orca crashes its tail. A room of nuns hole-punch a sheet of unleavened bread with military efficiency, to create perfectly rounded communion wafers, over and over again.\nThe term \u201cdoomscrolling\u201d was coined in a tweet in 2018, but popularised by business journalist Karen Ho in spring 2020, after she noticed how many people were hunched over their screens consuming excessive amounts of negative news, with faces like Munch\u2019s Scream. Ho started by simply asking her followers every night on Twitter: \u201c\u2018Hey, are you doomscrolling?\u2019 and people were like, \u2018Ohhhh, that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing!\u2019\u201d In response, she issued simple, daily self-care reminders \u2013 take a break from the screen, stop slouching, stretch your legs, grab a glass of water \u2013 and in autumn of last year, created @doomscroll_bot on Twitter to send regular reminders.\nHo says there is a key difference between doomscrolling and preparation \u2013 using the news as it was designed, to stay informed and make safe decisions based on that information. She ticks off healthcare policies, public health measures and the weather as things you should read, and prepare for. \u201cIf the NHS is saying: \u2018We have run out of hospital beds in Yorkshire\u2019, that stuff is depressing but it\u2019s important for you to know.\u201d Ho regularly updates the bot\u2019s programming, paying attention to current events and tailoring her message during \u201cdoomscrolling peaks\u201d such as the US presidential election, the Atlanta spa shootings and the murder of George Floyd. Her aim is to provide \u201csome small measure of action that will help people to feel less helpless\u201d.\nGraphic designer and photographer Emily Coxhead describes her colourful quarterly, the Happy Newspaper, as \u201ca reminder that there\u2019s always good stuff happening, even if we don\u2019t always hear about it\u201d. Coxhead started the newspaper in 2015, after finishing university and finding herself struggling with her mental health, feeling \u201cbombarded by bad news\u201d. The paper now has a team of paid contributors, 21,000 subscribers in 33 countries and more than 400,000 followers on social media.\nThe positive news movement\u2019s emphasis on community is appealing. Some of the good news fodder is stomach-churningly cheesy, with posts showing curlicued mottos on slogan cushions. And there are, undeniably, lots of tiny fluffy animals. But the bulk of it is resourceful, heartening and awe-inspiring in its collective endeavour. The Happy Newspaper is a combination of localised news and global development, with stories including Japan\u2019s appointment of a minister for loneliness, and a teenager who makes bow ties for shelter dogs to help them dazzle their potential owners. The key to the paper\u2019s success, Coxhead says, is its commitment to community, which is also baked into the business \u2013 for every two newspapers sold, she sends a free one to a school. \u201cI don\u2019t pretend that everything is covered in sunshine and rainbows, because it\u2019s obviously not,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I do think there needs to be a better balance.\u201d\nLooking back, much of my son\u2019s first year is blurry, but specific stories pierced cleanly through the fog. The Zaatari refugee camp which, thanks to the ingenuity of University of Sheffield scientists, began growing vegetables out of disused foam mattresses (the foam acts as a \u201cdesert garden\u201d, holding the vegetable\u2019s roots in place as it grows in a nutrient-rich water solution). The 89-year-old Chicagoan who sewed 600 face masks while grooving to the Beatles. The Sisterhood of the Travelling Wine volunteer group (which spans tens of thousands across the US), whose \u201cwine fairies\u201d leave booze on the doorsteps of those most needing a lift. Perusing this news daily over several months, I began to feel less desperate; less diluted. Replenished by these good news outlets, like roots growing almost magically in a mattress, I began to feel level.\nOf course, joyscrolling isn\u2019t for everyone. \u201cThis good news crap is just another example of complacency propaganda,\u201d Touissant, an ex-chef from Louisiana writes to me via email. We begin corresponding after he replies to one of my tweets about doomscrolling, saying he hates the term. \u201cThe focus isn\u2019t on us fixing the planet, or the broken healthcare system, but diversionary stories about how a bunch of teachers all donated their sick days to another teacher with cancer \u2013 while never mentioning the problem of the broken healthcare system.\u201d\nIt\u2019s true that you can use good news-only outlets to hide from the \u201creal\u201d world \u2013 as I once did. Pull the heavy-tog duvet of positivity over your head and mute the world around you. To do this for any length of time is obviously not sensible. There\u2019s an argument that platforming positive-only news is generating another kind of fake news; bad news doesn\u2019t go away with a blanket of optimism. Disengagement, even temporary, is also a privilege. Not everyone has people who can parse the news for them, who can determine what to pass on and what to hold back. \u201cYou have a huge swathe of the population who are uninformed and unaware, and we have seen globally how problematic that can be,\u201d Lakshmin notes. Agarwal agrees: \u201cSome of us can\u2019t dissociate from the bad news so easily. When there is a conversation about racism, people of colour cannot dissociate from that.\u201d In this vein, my friend S says not reading the news would leave her more psychologically vulnerable \u2013 forewarned, she says, is forearmed.\nAgarwal advises taking a more measured approach: \u201cBe mindful and reflective about the reasons why you are disengaging, and be mindful and reflective about when you are coming back.\u201d That includes filtering who you follow on social media \u201cand thinking carefully about the validity of your sources,\u201d she says. Read a whole piece from start to finish, then go offline (crucial, this bit) and discuss it, more fully, with your friends. In short: be intentional. Ho manages her own doomscrolling by \u201cgetting in and getting out. I\u2019m trying to disentangle from opinions and arguments.\u201dLakshmin says: \u201cBasically, don\u2019t start scrolling through your uncle\u2019s best friend\u2019s nephew\u2019s problematic Facebook posts before you go to sleep.\u201d\nI no longer read only good news. Thanks to a combination of medication and talking therapy, my depression lasted a matter of months. I started reading newspapers again, but I no longer get them delivered: I wanted to feel as if I was seeking out the news, rather than it feeling \u201cforced\u201d through my door. I don\u2019t keep any news apps on my phone and I rarely, if ever, watch the news on television. If it is on in a room \u2013 as it always is in my mother\u2019s kitchen \u2013 I don\u2019t stop to observe the car crash. I simply pass through. Looking back, I think it was less that I could not tolerate bad news, and more that I was experiencing a total sensory overload. Positive news outlets are no longer part of my daily routine, but I still enjoy them, regularly finding myself awestruck. Like the post about the 2,800-year-old skeletons found snogging on an archaeological site in Iran, in 1972. Snogging!\nResch finds the criticism of positive news outlets tiresome. \u201cMy head is not buried in the sand,\u201d he insists. \u201cIf it was, I\u2019d miss all of the good stuff.\u201d Good news is lucrative \u2013 he has now hired three people to help him sift through the best bits of the internet. It\u2019s not that it can be hard to find; rather, that there is just too much of it. \u201cI\u2019ve never had a day when I haven\u2019t found anything good,\u201d he says, before pausing for half a beat. \u201cNot yet.\u201d",

        "content": "San Antonio\u2019s free pre-k program could be a model for the country if Build Back Better comes law\nEven after Malik Johnson turned four years old, he would scream, trying desperately to communicate despite his speech delay.\nHis mother, Jennifer Emelogu, a former English teacher, knew he wouldn\u2019t be ready for kindergarten.\nSo Emelogu transferred Malik from his daycare to Pre-K 4 SA, San Antonio\u2019s grassroots model for high-quality early childhood education. Funded through a \u215b-cent local sales tax, the program has become a point of pride for the Texas city \u2013 a place where students and parents can actually get the support they need.\n\u201cEvery school in the world could take a page out of Pre-K 4 SA\u2019s book. For real,\u201d Emelogu said. \u201cThere\u2019s no kid that fell through the cracks here.\u201d\nBy the end of last academic year, Malik had learned how to calm himself down and his speech therapist felt certain he was prepared for elementary school.\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen so much progress,\u201d Emelogu said.\nNow, through the Build Back Better agenda, Joe Biden wants to give every three- and four-year-old in the United States access to high-quality early childhood education like Pre-K 4 SA. The plan would save the average family thousands each year on childcare, while making good preschool available to millions more kids.\nWhen Biden announced his trimmed-down Build Back Better framework late last month, universal Pre-K was still a prominent feature, even after the administration cut its original $3.5tn wishlist to $1.75tn. But the bill still faces an uncertain future in Congress, where conservative and progressive Democrats have been sparring over which social programs to preserve.\nFree, universal preschool could radically reform the country\u2019s status quo, where high-quality early childhood education is a luxury, not a right. For many families, childcare \u2013 sometimes as costly as college tuition \u2013 has become a formidable barrier to career growth and economic stability.\nSome parents are spending most if not all of their earnings on daycare or preschool. Others have dropped out of the workforce to become full-time caregivers.\n\u201cThe fact is, today, only about half of three- and four-year-olds in America are enrolled in early childhood education,\u201d Biden said last month. \u201cIn Germany, France, and the UK, even Latvia, the number of children in those countries enrolled is 90% \u2013 90%.\u201d\nIn fact, the US trails much of the world in enrollment in pre-primary education, even though there\u2019s clear evidence that high-quality programs pay off. Their rates of return often mirror or exceed stock market returns, especially among less privileged children.\nPossible benefits of good quality early childhood education are far-reaching, including, but not limited to, better health, higher incomes and less crime.\n\u201cIf the United States is gonna be competitive economically around the world in the years to come, it\u2019s absolutely essential that we invest in universal Pre-K and get our young people off to a much better start in their educational journey. So it\u2019s a pressing need,\u201d said Juli\u00e1n Castro, the former San Antonio mayor who spearheaded Pre-K 4 SA.\nUniversal Pre-K is wildly popular as a policy, with recent polling showing that as many as 73% of Republicans and 95% of Democrats support free preschool for three- and four-year-olds. It\u2019s also nothing new: in the 1970s, Congress almost made childcare an entitlement, and in the intervening decades prominent politicians including Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have championed the cause.\nUnder Biden, the White House is staffed by top experts like the treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, long an outspoken advocate for how high-quality early learning can bridge socioeconomic and educational disparities.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a policy that we should really focus on ensuring that there is high-quality provision, and we should really ensure that, you know, the access is given to those who stand to benefit the most,\u201d said Parag Pathak, a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\nIn San Antonio, Pre-K 4 SA is a stunning example of the difference preschool can make.\nSince the initiative launched in 2013, it has expanded to four campuses and serves 2,000 four-year-olds a year, while also providing professional development and competitive grants to promote quality early education throughout the city.\n\u201cWe aimed very high. Our goal was to be better than the best programs in the state and the country,\u201d Castro said.\nStudents learn through play, empowered with problem-solving techniques. They find solutions when conflicts arise, learn practical skills like following recipes, and plant seeds that grow into sunflowers taller than their own teachers.\nThey also give back to their community, creating San Antonio-inspired art for auction. Proceeds go to a local non-profit the kids choose during elections in the fall \u2013 a tradition that teaches them the importance of voting.\n\u201cYou\u2019re four years old, but there are so many things that you can do,\u201d said Jessica Cruz, a master teacher. \u201cAnd I think just giving them that sense of confidence, like, \u2018I can do things. Even though I\u2019m small, I still have a voice.\u2019\u201d\nAn impact study on the initiative\u2019s first cohort found that alumni had better attendance records than their peers and didn\u2019t need to repeat grades between kindergarten and second grade. By third grade, reading and math scores eclipsed the state average.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that the kids aren\u2019t capable. It\u2019s not that the families aren\u2019t capable. When they have access to highly skilled teachers, evidence-based curriculum and all the supports, the success speaks for itself,\u201d said Sarah Baray, Pre-K 4 SA\u2019s CEO.\nDone right, early childhood education \u201csets children up for success throughout life\u201d, she said.\n\u201cWhen we invest in the people of the community, that has exponential potential to benefit not just that child, not just that family, but the entire community. And that\u2019s how we build a strong future.\u201d\nBriana Saussy and her husband could be saving thousands more a year for their three-year-old\u2019s college fund if they didn\u2019t have to spend so much on part-time childcare.\nThe couple has intentionally shaped their life in San Antonio so they can be present for their kids\u2019 early years. Both work from home \u2013 Saussy as an author, her husband as a freelance teacher \u2013 and their younger son goes to preschool just three times a week.\nThey still pay more than $600 a month to a local children\u2019s center, rates that climb higher if their little boy ever needs to go in early one morning or attend a few extra days.\nLiving on their children\u2019s schedule also carries a cost: less publicity for Saussy\u2019s books, fewer classes picked up by her husband.\n\u201cFor us, that was a choice that we were happy to make. But I would be very resentful if it wasn\u2019t a choice \u2026 and I had to have him home because I couldn\u2019t afford it,\u201d Saussy said.\nParents across the country are constantly having to weigh options, which affect their careers, incomes and financial wellbeing. In Mesa, Arizona, Cinthia Alaniz and her husband work full-time. They pay for their four-year-old twins\u2019 daycare through state assistance, plus the money they are getting from the child tax credit.\n\u201cIf we weren\u2019t getting that, we would have to reconsider our whole entire situation,\u201d Alaniz said.\nWhen Alaniz found out she was pregnant with twins, she stopped working. With three older kids, some of whom would have also needed childcare, it made more sense for their family to live on a single income than for her entire wage to go toward daycare.\nAlaniz went back to work in 2019, while her mother and mother-in-law looked after the twins. If both caretakers were too busy, Alaniz switched around her schedule or brought the toddlers to work, which made it difficult to get much done.\nThen, she found a role as a family support specialist at an elementary school, where she\u2019s on the same schedule as her school-aged children. But she worries that if she gets a raise or her husband starts working more, they\u2019ll no longer qualify for assistance \u2013 a devastating prospect when twins effectively mean double the childcare costs.\n\u201cI would have to stop working until they were ready for kindergarten, and we would just be back in the boat that we were in before, where we would just be managing off of one income for a family of seven,\u201d Alaniz said.\nFor parents, universal pre-k begins to resolve these non-choices. Alaniz wouldn\u2019t have to worry about giving up her career because of childcare costs, while her twins would be guaranteed a free, high-quality education. And Saussy would find more flexibility helpful, even if she still wanted her son at home a few days a week.\n\u201cParents are left scrambling to try to figure out, like, what to do, and how to afford what seems like the best options,\u201d Saussy said. \u201cAnd I think programs like Pre-K 4 SA are filling a very needed gap.\n\u201cI think that if we can have more of that \u2013 and more options and more choices for parents \u2013 that\u2019s always a benefit.\u201d\nWhile \u201cuniversal\u201d has a nice ring to it, the truth is the most affluent families already have access to pre-k, tutors, and at-home care.\nBut \u201cthe real fear that people have is that if it\u2019s targeted, it\u2019s stigmatizing,\u201d explained James J Heckman, a Nobel prize-winning professor of economics at the University of Chicago.\n\u201cMaking it universal makes it less stigmatizing,\u201d he said, even though \u201cit\u2019s a strictly political criteria\u201d.\nUltimately, the kids who consistently get the most out of accessible early childhood education are the ones who start at a disadvantage, Heckman said. In Pre-K 4 SA\u2019s first cohort, for example, those who were economically underprivileged or limited English proficient benefited the most.\nAlthough Pre-K 4 SA is still a relatively young initiative with limited data, research on other high-quality programs reveals even longer-term positive effects for children and their parents, including on high school graduation, blood pressure, drug use, employment and income.\nThose benefits trickle down to the community through a reduction in crime and social spending, and an increase in productivity, Heckman\u2019s work shows.\n\u201cCompared to the cost of other things the federal government is doing,\u201d Castro said, \u201cthis is excellence on the cheap.\u201d\nFor Pre-K 4 SA, the federal government\u2019s unprecedented commitment to preschool would be \u201cmiraculous,\u201d Baray said.\nIt would provide an opportunity to \u201cexpand far beyond our wildest dreams\u201d, not by opening new learning centers on every corner, but by supporting other programs with teacher training, materials and curriculum.\n\u201cIf the funding came in through this federal initiative, oh my gosh, we\u2019d be ready to go,\u201d Baray said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the infrastructure to do it, to expand tomorrow. It\u2019s really a matter of funding issues.\u201d\nAs more seats in other programs open up to four-year-olds, Pre-K 4 SA also hopes to expand its programming to three-year-olds so educators can deepen their relationships with the families they serve.\n\u201cOne year, and they\u2019re gone. It just seems so fast. They\u2019re out the door. And they change so much within that one year,\u201d said Tonda Brown, director of one of the education centers.\n\u201cI can only imagine what they\u2019ll gain in two years.\u201d\nLast May, for the end of the school year, Pre-K 4 SA\u2019s students gathered and danced outside in the Texas heat. All the kids seemed happy to be there \u2013 and sad to leave. One stopped crying only to take a student-teacher photo.\nProud parents drove up one by one for a parade, their cars decked out to celebrate all their children\u2019s accomplishments.\n\u201cI really do feel that our families feel it when they leave,\u201d Brown said. \u201cTheir child\u2019s been loved on, and they\u2019ve gotten all the things that they\u2019re gonna need.\u201d",

        "content": "For the past five years, New Zealand have been the best and most effective all-format team in cricket\nAt this point, the most surprising thing about New Zealand making it to the T20 World Cup final is that anyone is still surprised by it at all. This is the team that reached the final of the 2015 World Cup, the final of the 2019 World Cup (which they lost, of course, because of a clause in the small print), who won the inaugural World Test Championship, and who are currently ranked as the best side in the world in Test and ODI cricket. For the past five years, they\u2019ve been the best, and most effective, all-format team in the sport. And yet, flick back three weeks to the tournament previews and you\u2019ll find that they were sixth in the betting.\nIndia were favourites, then England, Pakistan, Australia, South Africa and New Zealand. Given the way we all talk about them, \u201cand New Zealand\u201d is maybe what they ought to rename the side. Always an afterthought, everybody\u2019s second favourites. The New Zealanders, you guess, are perfectly happy with that. There used to be a theory, back in the 2000s, when the All Blacks always blew up in the knockout rounds of the Rugby World Cup, that the team couldn\u2019t handle the pressure that came with being favourites. It\u2019s not a problem the Black Caps have had to worry about, even while they\u2019ve been beating everyone else so often.\nThey haven\u2019t only turned themselves into the best team in the world, they\u2019ve somehow done it without anyone else really even noticing it was happening. They\u2019re elaborately camouflaged, a ruthlessly efficient team masquerading as a scrappy bunch of underdogs from the world\u2019s boondocks. They\u2019re a World XI who make out as if they\u2019re Ilford Seconds. Which is why there\u2019s precious little point asking them exactly how they\u2019ve gone about this transformation (I\u2019ve tried, repeatedly), because a proper answer would blow their cover and sound uncomfortably like bragging.\nIf you ask their senior players, they will talk about the team culture, about a set of values shaped by Brendon McCullum when he was captain. They will mention the strength of their domestic set-up, and the quality of the pitches they play on, and at the end of it you will be left with no real idea how a country which, according to the board\u2019s latest reports, has only 68,383 registered players and about half as much money as Virat Kohli owns, has turned out a team who can consistently beat the bigger and better resourced sides. You\u2019d have had more luck asking Arkle to explain why he can run so fast.\nFrom this distance, it seems that at least half those 68,383 are apparently capable of biffing a few sixes and bowling a tidy over or two, another quarter of them can keep wicket too, a large part of the rest bowl swing and seam at about 85mph, and the other one is Kane Williamson. This is a team who have been playing Daryl Mitchell, a bloke who has never opened in professional cricket, at the top of the order, who lost one fast bowler, Lockie Ferguson, and were able to replace him with another in Adam Milne, while they left a third, Kyle Jamieson, on the bench. They couldn\u2019t even fit Finn Allen, Ross Taylor and Colin de Grandhomme into the squad.\nNew Zealand, who have one of the smallest pools of professional players in the world game, still have enviable strength in depth. And they\u2019ll need it, now that Devon Conway had to pull out of the final because he broke his hand when he punched his bat after he got out against England the other night (\u201cIt\u2019s not the smartest thing he\u2019s ever done,\u201d said head coach, Gary Stead). Conway is a big loss, at a bad time.\nBecause there is, of course, one thing missing in this picture. As Jimmy Neesham said when he was asked why he refused to celebrate after the team won their semi-final, \u201cThe job\u2019s not done yet\u201d. New Zealand may have won the World Test championship, but they\u2019ve never won an international tournament in white ball cricket. And if that wasn\u2019t enough pressure already, it would have to be Australia who are in their way again this time. This is, to use the new cliche, not a \u201cmatch-up\u201d that much suits them. The New Zealand government\u2019s own history website describes the rivalry with Australia as like one with \u201can older sibling who haven\u2019t always taken us seriously\u201d.\nThe Australians waited 16 years before playing New Zealand in a one-off Test, beat them by an innings and 103 runs in one and a half days, then (come back when you\u2019ve grown up) refused to play them again for another 27 years. In all, New Zealand have played Australia 212 times across the three formats, and beaten them in only 51, which is their worst win/loss record against any team in international cricket. It hasn\u2019t been much better in the past five years either, when Australia have beaten them in five out of five Tests, six out of 11 ODIs and five out of nine T20s. Last time they met in a final, in the 50-over World Cup in 2015, Australia marmalised them.\nThis is one fixture where playing the underdog doesn\u2019t seem to pay off. Which might be why it\u2019s time for New Zealand to admit that, given everything else they\u2019ve achieved recently, they ought to be the favourites to win it.",

The text was not substantially weakened overnight, but there is a long process still to go through on Saturday, and perhaps Sunday, in which some countries are likely to attack some of the key provisions.\nThe text of what the UK hosts said should be the final draft of the outcome of the Cop26 climate summit was released in Glasgow at about 9am on Saturday.\nDelegates will pore over the decision until noon, when they will be asked for their reactions in a \u201cstocktake\u201d, after which the presidency will seek to move quickly to a final session at which the decisions can be adopted.\nThe final stages of the process will last at least until Saturday afternoon, and could stretch on much longer.\nBob Ward, policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics and Political Science, said: \u201cThis text is still pretty good and one I hope that all countries can embrace. It continues to request countries to deliver more ambitious pledges next year.\n\u201cCountries will leave Glasgow painfully aware that collectively current pledges for emissions cuts by 2030 are not ambitious enough. They are not aligned with the goal of the Paris agreement of holding the rise in warming to well below 2C degrees, and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5C. The draft text also still calls on all countries to accelerate efforts towards the phase-out of unabated coal power and inefficient fossil fuel subsidies.\n\u201cImportantly, the UK presidency has now published draft text that outlines a good process for agreeing a significant increase in investment in developing countries to help them make their economies zero-carbon and climate-resilient. It is time for countries to stop arguing over the text and to start taking the action that has been promised, particularly to increase the flows of financial support to developing countries.\u201d\nThe mood of the talks has been generally characterised as constructive, though some nations have sought to water down agreements on seeking to phase out fossil fuels and limit global heating to 1.5C above pre industrial levels. Developing countries also want further assurances on climate finance, needed to help them cope with the impacts of extreme weather, and loss and damage, which refers to climate-related catastrophes.\nThe cover decision is the key outcome of the talks, outlining how countries will seek to fulfil the aims of the 2015 Paris agreement and limit greenhouse gas emissions. It was one of a raft of documents released on related issues such as adaptation to the impacts of climate breakdown, finance and some of the technical aspects of the Paris agreement, such as carbon trading.\nCurrent national plans \u2013 known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs) \u2013 would lead to 2.4C of heating, according to an analysis this week by Climate Action Tracker.\nCountries are expected to return with better pledges in 2025, under the Paris agreement, but many are now demanding the deadline should be brought forward. This is seen as the most closely fought area of disagreement as the UK hosts struggle to broker a deal.\nSince the Paris agreement was signed, binding countries to limit temperature rises \u201cwell below\u201d 2C above pre-industrial levels while \u201cpursuing efforts\u201d to a 1.5C limit, new science has shown that breaching the 1.5C threshold would lead to disastrous impacts, some irreversible, including the inundation of many low-lying areas. Heating has now reached 1.1C, and extreme weather is already taking hold around the world.\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said emissions must be cut by 45% by 2030 compared with 2010 levels to stay within 1.5C.",

The prime minister called on elderly and vulnerable people to get their booster jabs in order to prevent a rise in Covid cases in the UK, saying: \u201cWe\u2019ve been here before. We remember what happens when the wave starts rolling in.\u201d\nWhile the UK had one of the highest case rates in Europe in October, daily case data and the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics on infection levels suggest there has been a fall in recent weeks.\nAn estimated one in 60 people in the community in England had Covid in the week ending 6 November, compared with one in 50 people in late October. There has also been a drop in Wales, but the rate of people testing positive in Scotland has remained level and the trend is unclear in Northern Ireland.\nAfter falling cases and hospital admissions in the past two or three weeks, Ferguson said there had been a \u201chint of an uptick in the last few days\u201d. However, he said the UK was in \u201cquite a different situation\u201d to countries such as Germany, as UK cases had been \u201cvery high \u2026 for the last four months\u201d.\nWhile the high rates \u201cobviously had some downsides\u201d, Ferguson said, \u201cit has also paradoxically had an upside of boosting the immunity of the population compared with [European countries] \u2026 which have had much lower case numbers and are only now seeing an uptick.\u201d\nIn a study showing how protection against Covid begins to wane several months after full vaccination, researchers at Imperial College London found that infection rates rose from 0.35% in the three months after the second dose to 0.55% three to six months after the second shot.",

        "content": "The former England manager discusses how Ars\u00e8ne Wenger inspired him to coach, his \u2018stubbornness\u2019 as a gifted player and the frightening cardiac arrest that nearly cost him his life in 2018\n\u201cI had courage,\u201d Glenn Hoddle says during a long conversation about life and death, football and identity, heartache and glory, playing and coaching. It is also a conversation about Hoddle himself and where he fits among diverse football figures from Danny Blanchflower, Brian Clough and Johan Cruyff to Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, Daniel Levy and Antonio Conte.\nHoddle was a gifted footballer who played in a way that belonged to Europe rather than England, 30 years before the game in this country caught up with his vision and creativity. He stuck to his playmaking principles and, as a tactically astute coach and manager of England, developed off the field until he was brought down by his own words. Then, in October 2018, Hoddle almost died when he suffered a cardiac arrest, and that experience has made him even more reflective.\n\u201cI had a strong belief in my ability,\u201d Hoddle continues as he remembers playing for Spurs, his boyhood club, between 1975 and 1987, when his sumptuous talent collided with the brute force of English football in an era defined by crunching 50-50 tackles and long-ball tactics. He was derided as \u201cGlenda\u201d or a \u201cluxury player\u201d as much as he was revered. But Hoddle remained true to himself. \u201cI had a lot of stubbornness. I was very shy but, when it came to football, I had to do what was natural. If people didn\u2019t understand me, so be it.\n\u201cPerhaps if I\u2019d been Dutch or French or Spanish it would have been very different. When I finally went abroad to play [for Wenger\u2019s championship-winning Monaco team from 1987 to 1991] I realised that No 10 was my prime position. I played once at No 10 for England.\u201d That was against Hungary in 1983 when Hoddle scored and created two other goals.\nIn his enjoyable new autobiography, Playmaker, written deftly by the Observer\u2019s Jacob Steinberg, Hoddle admits he felt \u201csuffocated\u201d playing for England and how \u201cwe were painfully small-minded and it took us an eternity to change\u201d. As he says now: \u201cIt was always a very rigid 4-4-2 and for England I got chucked out on the right-hand side. Even for Spurs I didn\u2019t play where I should have done until the last season when Clive Allen scored 49 goals and I played as the 10.\u201d\nHoddle was a man out of his time. \u201cI knew that but I couldn\u2019t admit it as a player. People used to say: \u2018You should have got more than 53 caps,\u2019 and my answer was always pretty bland and steadfast: \u2018I\u2019m proud of the 53 I got.\u2019 But, deep down, I knew I was a continental player. You either give in, and go against your instincts, or you fight it.\u201d\nHe was strengthened by the belief of others. \u201cI was 19 and Danny Blanchflower [who captained Spurs to the Double in 1960-61] said: \u2018Glenn, the luxury player is the one that cannot do what you can do. He cannot see a pass. He keeps giving the ball away. Don\u2019t ever think you\u2019re a luxury player.\u2019 It was a real boost of confidence from the great Danny Blanchflower.\u201d\nBrian Clough was another admirer and he even tried to sign Hoddle. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget it,\u201d Hoddle says. \u201cMy mate Sean was a good mimic and I picked the phone up and heard this voice: \u2018Young man, it\u2019s Brian Clough of Nottingham Forest Football Club.\u2019 I went: \u2018Fuck off, Sean,\u2019 and put the phone down. It rung again and it really was Brian Clough. He spent 10 minutes talking to me and I was embarrassed. Clough sussed it and went: \u2018It\u2019s pretty obvious you\u2019re staying at Tottenham. It\u2019s been good talking to you and good luck with your career.\u2019 He also said he\u2019d build a team around me if he was England manager. I\u2019m not just saying this because he\u2019d have played me but it was a huge mistake not to appoint him \u2013 without a doubt.\u201d\nIn his book Hoddle laments the fact that, in England, \u201cwe were insular and closed off. Our island mentality stood in the way of progress\u201d. He thrived on inclusivity \u2013 whether it was genuine delight in playing alongside Ossie Ard\u00edles and Ricky Villa, at a time when there were so few foreign footballers in England, being man-marked by Cruyff or agreeing to join Wenger at Monaco. \u201cI was opening up spiritually,\u201d he says of meeting Wenger. \u201cMy intuition and the connection with Ars\u00e8ne told me this is the right move. He wanted me to play No 10 and I loved every minute of being with Ars\u00e8ne and we won the league the first year.\u201d\nThere was a stark difference between Wenger at Monaco and Arsenal. \u201cIan Wright, Lee Dixon, Tony Adams and David Seaman all said he\u2019d come in at half-time and would hardly say anything. That wasn\u2019t the Ars\u00e8ne I knew when he was 36. He came into the dressing room sometimes and the old Lucozade bottle would hit the floor. He would shout in French and I\u2019d just look at Mark Hateley and go: \u2018He\u2019s not happy, is he?\u2019\u201d\nWenger ignited a fire in him to coach and, in his first managerial position, Hoddle did exceptional work at Swindon. He helped them win promotion to the Premier League and had his happiest time as a coach with a team that, he says, \u201chad something I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen even with Barcelona. I\u2019d even go as far as to say maybe with Man City. We had Mickey Hazard, Ross MacLaren, John Moncur and me all being naturally two-footed. It was amazing.\u201d\nBut the club were so broke that Hoddle loaned Swindon \u00a3200,000 to buy Shaun Taylor, a tough defender from Exeter. \u201cI never managed a club that had money. Tottenham didn\u2019t have money, Southampton didn\u2019t and Chelsea didn\u2019t when I arrived [in 1993]. I wanted Andy Townsend to stay because he was Chelsea\u2019s captain. But Villa were after him and Andy wanted to go.\n\u201cThe facilities at Chelsea were disgraceful. My office was in the staff changing room where there was an old BT phone with the bottom pulled out. They told me to put in a 50p coin and it would drop through to the bottom. You would then put it back into the slot before the call cut out. I\u2019ve got everyone walking in and out and Ron Atkinson [the then Villa manager] said: \u2018Glenn, what\u2019s them noises?\u2019 I said: \u2018Ron, I\u2019m not even going to tell you.\u2019 We were trying to compete a \u00a32.1m deal and, God, it was horrible.\u201d\nHoddle convinced Ken Bates, the owner, finally to spend some money and he also brought Ruud Gullit and, slowly, began a transformation of Chelsea that would culminate in Roman Abramovich buying the club. In 1996, three years into his managerial career at Stamford Bridge, Hoddle was shocked to be offered the England job. He did well, especially as a young manager, and England played some fine football before losing on penalties to Argentina in the 1998 World Cup. It is a match Hoddle cannot bear rewatching because he believes that, if they had beaten Argentina, they had a team with the potential to have won the tournament.\nHis England tenure ended in chaos and embarrassment in January 1999 when, during an interview with the Times, he was quoted as saying that disabled people were being punished for sins they had committed in a former life. In his book, he stresses that: \u201cI never spoke about punishment. I never used that word, nor did I talk about karma working from another life or the disabled having to reap what they sowed.\u201d\nMatt Dickinson, who carried out the interview, is highly respected and so I ask Hoddle what he thinks when I mention his name. \u201cI\u2019ve managed to use it spiritually, because one of the biggest things is forgiveness. I talked to him about reincarnation, and my belief that it\u2019s an opportunity to learn when we come back. I\u2019ve forgiven him and, in a way, I think spiritually I\u2019ve gained.\u201d\nHoddle denies he said the alleged words and told me: \u201cBefore I was 30, I probably would never have been able to forgive, but my faith and spiritual life has allowed me to see this is an opportunity. I haven\u2019t got any feelings of bitterness about what happened.\u201d A day after our interview, on Friday, Dickinson wrote a column in which he stressed the veracity of his reporting and said how he wished Hoddle would \u201ctake responsibility\u201d for the interview.\nOn 27 October 2018, his 61st birthday, Hoddle suffered a near fatal cardiac arrest while working in the BT Sport studios. He was only saved by the quick response of Simon Daniels, a sound technician who gave him CPR and knew how to use a defibrillator. \u201cOne of the few things I remember from that day was that I said to Johnno, my driver who dropped me off: \u2018See you at half past five.\u2019 You know what I say now when I go back to the same studio? \u2018Johnno, see you at half past five \u2026 God willing.\u2019 He says: \u2018Oh, don\u2019t say that!\u2019 But I do. That\u2019s how close I was to going. I think: \u2018Please God, let me come back and get in that car at half past five.\u2019 It was frightening for everyone, not just me.\u201d\nHoddle looks well now and we are soon talking football and Spurs again \u2013 for he managed the club he loves from 2001 to 2003. He remains a fan and I ask him if he has ever met the reclusive owner of Spurs? \u201cNo. I\u2019ve never met Joe Lewis. Never even had a phone call. Never had a conversation with him and Spurs were always my club. That was the happiest I should have been but it was probably the most disgruntled I felt \u2013 at Tottenham. It was such a shame because I wanted it so much. I wanted to build a side to win the league like we did at Monaco. That was one of my big regrets but the money wasn\u2019t there.\u201d\nHe could have bought both Fernando Morientes from Real Madrid and Samuel Eto\u2019o from Mallorca for just \u00a312m in 2003. But, he says, Lewis and Daniel Levy, the Tottenham chairman, moved too slowly. \u201cThat hurt me big time,\u201d Hoddle says.\nHe gets on passably with Levy but he makes it plain that life is never easy with a chairman who like to haggle over every aspect of Tottenham\u2019s business. Hoddle nods when I ask if he believes Levy has backed himself into a corner after his recent choices of managers have failed and he has had to make concessions to lure the driven but combustible Conte to Spurs.\n\u201cI\u2019m not privy to it but, looking from the outside, he has exhausted other opportunities. He\u2019s had to go back for Conte [after they failed to reach agreement in the summer] so there must be a difference in the negotiation. This is a crucial time for Daniel because his track record of sacking managers is there for everyone to see. We could have brought in three good players for the amount of money given to pay out managers.\u201d\nThe old playmaker looks up and, still full of hope and yearning, he smiles. \u201cI\u2019m praying to God that we get it right because, as a Spurs man, I just want them to be successful.\u201d\nPlaymaker by Glenn Hoddle is published by HarperCollins",

        "content": "Analysis: many experts believe that the continent is only now tackling a Delta variant surge that arrived in the UK some time ago\nOnce again the UK and Europe are heading in opposite directions. While Covid-19 cases in Britain have been declining, those in France, Germany, Austria and several other countries have risen dramatically in recent weeks. A fourth pandemic wave threatens to break over these nations, raising the prospect of renewed lockdowns there.\nThis raises a critically important question: is the UK likely to follow suit in a few weeks, or will Europe\u2019s rising numbers peak and start to decline, as they have been doing in Britain? Will Europe follow us or will we follow Europe?\nProf Mark Woolhouse of Edinburgh University is clear on the issue. \u201cI think the UK is ahead at present and Europe is following us,\u201d he told the Observer. A major factor in this process was the arrival of the Delta variant of the Covid virus, he added. \u201cIt is substantially more serious than previous variants and it hit many European countries much later than it did in Britain. It has struck in these nations at a time when vaccine protection \u2013 typically in the most vulnerable, the ones who were vaccinated first \u2013 has begun to wane significantly. That is not an ideal situation at all.\u201d\nThis point was backed by Prof Neil Ferguson from Imperial College London, who told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that he thought the UK was in \u201cquite a different situation\u201d from other European nations, where curbs on freedoms are being considered.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had two or three weeks of declining cases and admission to hospitals \u2013 that may be petering out, it is too early to say. We\u2019ve also had very high case numbers \u2013 between 30,000 and 50,000 a day \u2013 really for the last four months, since the beginning of July.\n\u201cThat has obviously had some downsides. It has also, paradoxically, had an upside of boosting the immunity of the population compared with countries like Germany, the Netherlands and France, which have had much lower case numbers and are only now seeing an uptick.\u201d\nMichael Head of Southampton University also argues that European countries are now arriving at the point the UK found itself in a few months ago.\n\u201cThe UK rolled out a vaccination programme earlier than most countries, and therefore has experienced the impact of waning immunity earlier. However, the booster vaccines here in the UK are clearly having an impact around hospital admissions and new cases in older populations.\u201d\nProf Paul Hunter of the University of East Anglia is even more emphatic. \u201cWe are not behind Europe in this wave: they are behind us. We are not currently seeing a surge of the same magnitude as Europe at present largely because of the high case numbers over recent months, which most of Europe missed out on. The key exception is Romania, which has just had a large peak and which is now seeing a decline.\u201d\nThis type of behaviour is typical of an epidemic infection as it becomes endemic, Hunter adds. \u201cAs a disease approaches its endemic equilibrium you get oscillations around the eventual equilibrium. So we can probably expect oscillations across Europe for a year or so yet. Sometimes the UK will be worse than Europe: at other times Europe will be worse than us.\u201d",

        "content": "Designers hope that the outfits worn by Sarah Jessica Parker in the forthcoming TV sequel will boost fashion sales\nThe Guardian\u2019s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.\u00a0Learn more.\nIt was the show that made Manolo Blahnik a byword for achingly cool after the designer\u2019s shoes played a starring role on Sarah Jessica Parker\u2019s feet in the early noughties. Now fashion brands and retailers are hoping that the \u201cSex and the City effect\u201d will strike again with And Just Like That, the much-anticipated sequel series.\nThe Guardian\u2019s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.\u00a0Learn more.\nLast week, the latest image circulated of Sarah Jessica Parker wearing a pair of dungarees on the set of And Just Like That, sending newspaper fashion columnists into a frenzy. The power of the franchise means that this image alone could increase sales of the trousers.\n\u201cDungarees could definitely get a bounce from this,\u201d says Jane Shepherdson, who was brand director for Topshop when Sex and the City hit its peak and is now chair of fashion rental platform My Wardrobe HQ. \u201cThe way that the show will do it \u2013 sort of sexy, feminine but also a bit rock. That kind of combination is attractive for a lot of people.\u201d\nShepherdson speaks from experience. While CEO at Whistles, the brand released a pleated coral midiskirt called the Carrie, named in honour of Parker\u2019s character, Carrie Bradshaw, in 2011. An association with an era\u2019s most fashionable TV show \u2013 and its most fashionable character \u2013 meant the Carrie quickly became a bestseller. Shepherdson believes the new series could have a similar impact. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be at all surprised if they come up with some looks that are highly desirable and that we will all want to wear,\u201d she says. \u201cI think there will be people who will think \u2018oh, yeah, that\u2019s for me\u2019, because they see it on the show.\u201d\nThere is already evidence that this may be the case \u2013 despite the fact that the show doesn\u2019t air until next month. In July, Lyst reported that searches for Fendi baguette bags \u2013 a Sex and the City classic set to be reprised \u2013 were up 45% after Parker was seen carrying one. Platform heels, very much a new addition to Bradshaw\u2019s shoedrobe, had a similar bounce, with searches up 21%. While some have questioned the outfits in images seen so far from the show \u2013 Rebecca Weinberg, who worked on the original, described the looks as \u201cprim and polished\u201d \u2013 a huge fanbase for the show means millions of viewers will be sizing up the looks.\nAfter Parker wore the Lena Non-Stop Disco platform by Terry de Havilland at the end of this summer, the style sold out (with a \u00a3275 price tag) and did so again when more were put on sale. The endorsement helped put the brand on new radars. \u201cWe found it helped enormously with brand exposure specifically in the American market and we gained a lot of new customers from there,\u201d says sales and marketing director Josh Spurling. \u201cThe exposure gained by someone as iconic as the character Carrie Bradshaw really helped point customers in our direction.\u201d\nOther items have had similar stories \u2013 a dress by British brand Emilia Wickstead worn by Kristin Davis sold out, as did Saint Laurent shoes worn by Parker. In July, a picture of Parker wearing the Bobbie Jean hat (\u00a3235) by New York-based milliner Monrowe was released, leading to a spike in sales. \u201cIt definitely won\u2019t hurt the brand in any way having a style icon in one of your signature pieces,\u201d says founder and designer Dani Evans. \u201cI\u2019m sure the brand awareness will become more highlighted after the show airs. I wouldn\u2019t be mad if Carrie did for Monrowe what she did for Manolo Blahnik.\u201d\nLong before the show hits UK TV screens on 9 December, Instagram has played its part in the anticipation around the outfits. Images of Parker\u2019s Bradshaw, Davis as Charlotte Yorke Goldenblatt and Cynthia Nixon as Miranda Hobbes have been pored over. Accounts such as @justlikethatcloset and @everyoutfitonsatc document the looks in minute detail, to their thousands of followers.\nSex and the City ran for six seasons from 1998 to 2004, and there have been two follow-up films, in 2008 and 2010. Manolo Blahnik and Jimmy Choo benefited. The show, in a way that seemed very modern at the time, name checked designer brands specifically, with shoes a particular focus. As it became more popular \u2013 with 10.6 million viewers in the US tuning in for the finale \u2013 the fortunes of these brands grew. According to a buyer at Neiman Marcus in 2000, Blahnik\u2019s sales tripled thanks to the show.\nMolly Rogers, one of the costume designers for And Just Like That, has worked to update the wardrobes of the three main characters \u2013 who are now in their 50s. They re-wear items that were worn in Sex and the City \u2013 perhaps to please super-fans, but also as a nod to a more sustainable take on style. Blahnik\u2019s blue satin shoes, worn by Bradshaw to marry Mr Big in the first Sex and the City movie, make an appearance. Vintage \u2013 a big part of the first series too \u2013 is also important. At one point, Davis wears a ruffled top by Givenchy from 1996, while Nixon has a vintage Bottega Veneta bag.\nThe clothes reflect their characters, 11 years on from their last outing. \u201cIn our initial meeting with Michael Patrick King [the show\u2019s executive producer and writer], he spoke to us about growth and changes in life and friendships,\u201d she says. \u201cThese storylines sent us out into the world looking for a wardrobe to illustrate where they were.\u201d Some things are constant, of course: \u201cCarrie will forever be the NYC woman who mixes vintage and new, up and downtown, and Charlotte is obviously an Upper East Side mom with that lifestyle.\u201d\nRogers, who worked on the original series with costume designer Patricia Field, says digital culture makes the big reveal of broadcast trickier. \u201cI have tried to keep some surprises but the paparazzi have really broadcast everything that was on the exterior [scenes shot outside] around the world.\u201d She is, however, confident some surprises will only be seen when the first episodes air.\n\u201cHopefully not many of the interior scenes got out on to the airwaves,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are no rules in costuming this show. I hope everyone has a great time watching.\u201d",

Gabriella needs two parents. Thank you all for your overwhelming care these past three weeks.\n\u201cThe last act of the hunger strike will be our patchwork event in front of the Foreign Office at 13.30, then I will be going to the hospital for a full check-up. Thank you for keeping our family in the light.\u201d\nRatcliffe told the PA news agency his job was to \u201ckeep going\u201d, adding: \u201cWe probably hoped we\u2019d get a breakthrough doing this. We haven\u2019t yet. I didn\u2019t want to go out in an ambulance. I want to walk out with my head held high.\u201d He also criticised Boris Johnson for his \u201ctelling\u201d absence in talking to him during the protest.\nHis strike ended as a patchwork was due to be unveiled, made from all the patches that supporters have been sending throughout his time camped outside the Foreign Office.\nRatcliffe began the demonstration outside the Foreign Office, in central London, last month and endured almost three weeks in his latest attempt to force action from the UK government to bring his wife home.\nHe was joined at a vigil on Friday by his seven-year-old daughter, Gabriella, and supporters, who gathered in a show of solidarity. But allies had started to raise concerns for his health and expressed fears that he could permanently damage himself.\nEarlier on Saturday, the Labour MP Tulip Siddiq called for Johnson to visit her constituent \u201cin solidarity\u201d. She tweeted: \u201cIt has been three weeks since Richard Ratcliffe last ate any food. In that time, not a single government minister has visited his camp outside the Foreign Office in solidarity.\n\u201cWill the prime minister take five minutes out of his day to visit my constituent today?\u201d\nSpeaking on Thursday, Ratcliffe said: \u201cI think there\u2019s a basic medical limit on how long you do a hunger strike for. I made a promise to Nazanin, I made a promise to my family, Mum in particular, and to the family doctors, that I won\u2019t take it too far.\n\u201cBut yeah, I don\u2019t think we walk away head held high feeling like it\u2019s all been sorted.\u201d\nThe Middle East minister, James Cleverly, met Ratcliffe this week to discuss the current situation regarding his wife\u2019s detention in Iran, where she has been held since 2016 \u2013 more than 2,000 days.\nAfter the meeting, Ratcliffe said he had been left feeling \u201cdeflated\u201d, adding: \u201cIf I\u2019m honest, it felt like, you know, perfectly nice, sincere, caring, everyone in the room was caring. But you know we\u2019re still stuck in the same status quo.\n\u201cWe\u2019re still stuck in the same problems that led us to end up on hunger strike.\u201d\nThroughout his near-three-week protest, he has been calling for the British government to pay a \u00a3400m debt to Tehran, dating back to the 1970s. The British debt is acknowledged as a precondition for the release of Zaghari-Ratcliffe, as well as other detainees.",

        "content": "The biggest crowd since Gold Cup day in March 2020 crammed into the stands here on Saturday for the Paddy Power Gold Cup, and more than 30,000 fans were gripped by every second and stride of the run up to the famous hill as Midnight Shadow, at 9-1, held-on by just three-quarters of a length from the fast-finishing favourite, Protektorat. \u201cHow did you know you were going to hold on right to the line?\u201d, Ryan Mania, the winner\u2019s jockey, was asked shortly afterwards. \u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d was the honest reply.\nAs it was on Friday, when Rachael Blackmore performed a minor miracle to stay aboard Gin On Lime, the second-last fence proved to be a turning point in the race. Coole Cody, last year\u2019s front-running winner, had produced a convincing reprise of that performance from the off and he was still going strongly when he clipped the top of the first fence in the home straight and stumbled to the ground on landing.\nFontwell Park: 12.25\u00a0Wiseguy\u00a012.55\u00a0Romanor\u00a01.25\u00a0Guy De Guye\u00a02.00\u00a0Moulins Clermont\u00a02.35\u00a0Bleue Away\u00a03.10\u00a0Salty Boy\u00a03.43\u00a0Quinta Do MarCheltenham: 1.10\u00a0Does He Know\u00a01.45\u00a0Go Another One (nb)\u00a02.20\u00a0Nube Negra\u00a02.55\u00a0Jesse Evans (nap)\u00a03.30\u00a0Washington\u00a04.00\u00a0Timeforatune\nThat left Midnight Shadow in a clear lead and apparently in need only of a clean jump at the last to secure the win. He jumped it soundly enough but then slipped on landing, briefly leaving Mania with clear daylight between jockey and saddle. He did well to sit tight but his mount was suddenly in need of the line, with the most famous hill in National Hunt racing still to come.\nA wall of noise tumbled down from the stands as they set off to climb it, with Protektorat, the 11-2 favourite, leading a pack of rivals who were closing in with every stride. Midnight Shadow\u2019s lead was down to three-quarters of a length as he finally made it across the line, with Protektorat in second and Lalor and Dostal Phil filling the frame.\nMania and Sue Smith, Midnight Shadow\u2019s trainer, won the Grand National with 66-1 shot Auroras Encore in 2013, and the trainer was rightly proud of her latest big-race success.\n\u201cWe only had one horse to bring down here and he\u2019s paid us back today,\u201d Smith said. \u201cIt was terrifying to watch. There aren\u2019t many horses that could have done what he\u2019s done at the last and I just thought \u2018that\u2019s it\u2019, but he just picked himself up and kept going.\n\u201cI\u2019m probably a bit more emotional [than after the National] because I\u2019m that much older. It\u2019s special for everyone because we\u2019re only a small yard and the northern yards don\u2019t get to do this very often.\u201d\nMania, who retired from race-riding 18 months after his Grand National success, was celebrating his most valuable win since returning to the saddle in 2019.\n\u201cHe got a little bit lonely, which he can do in his races if he is in front for too long, and the lack of concentration maybe didn\u2019t help,\u201d Mania said. \u201cIn fairness, he was never going to get beat as he is very game. I could feel the horses coming to me but he was never going to let them past.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure it is emotional for most jockeys but it is especially emotional for me to have retired and come back and do all this for my family. I was very positive and that is how I rode him and that is how he has gone and done it. There are no plans to retire. I\u2019ve got a good 10 years in me yet.\u201d\nDan Skelton, Protektorat\u2019s trainer, had earlier seen his novice chaser Third Time Lucki maintain an unbeaten record over fences with an easy success in the Grade Two November Novice Chase.\nThird Time Lucki jumped with impressive speed and precision throughout and put in a spectacular leap at the fourth-last before being pushed out up the hill to win by nearly five lengths.\n\u201cOriginally, the plan was to go here and then Henry VIII [novice chase at Sandown in December],\u201d Skelton said. \u201cWhether that\u2019s going to happen now, I just need to speak to Mike [Newbould, his owner]. He could go straight to Kempton [at Christmas].\u201d\nThe main target for Third Time Lucki, though, remains the Festival meeting in March and he remains around 10-1 for the Arkle Trophy, in a market headed by Willie Mullins\u2019s Appreciate It at around 5-2.\nTwenty of the 47 declared runners on the final day of Cheltenham\u2019s November meeting are due to run in the Greatwood Handicap Hurdle, which highlights the disappointing field sizes elsewhere on the card but does at least focus the punters\u2019 attention and betting money on one of the most competitive Cheltenham handicaps this side of the Festival meeting in March. Nicky Henderson\u2019s lightly-raced No Ordinary Joe, in the JP McManus colours, will attract plenty of support, as his trainer launched his hurdling career in a Grade Two at Ascot last year when he was around 10 lengths behind the top-class My Drogo.\n He went on to win small-field events at Southwell and Worcester but Sunday\u2019s test will be very different and it could pay to look towards a runner with more experience. Glory And Fortune has registered a strong time in both of his win so far this season, but the outstanding individual piece of form in the race may be the close fourth by Jesse Evans (2.55) in theGalway Hurdle in July.\n Noel Meade\u2019s gelding was forced to race a little wider than ideal but still finishing close behind the principals and may well have been trained with Sunday\u2019s race in mind ever since.Cheltenham 1.45 This Grade Three handicap could take less winning than the one in which Go Another One finished fifth at the October meeting here. John McConnell\u2019s gelding has plenty of form at the track and is a fair price at around 9-2 to be yet another Irish-trained winner at Cheltenham this year.Cheltenham 2.20 Just four runners for the Grade Two Schloer Chase but a competitive race all the same, with Politologue and Put The Kettle On, the last two winners of the Queen Mother Champion Chase, in the field. Slight preference, though, is for Nube Negra, who looked a little unfortunate when only a length behind Put The Kettle On at the Festival and may have more scope for improvement as this will be just his eighth start over fences.\nCheltenham 3.30 Another small field but again all four runners are in with a chance. I Like To Move It is unbeaten in two starts over timber and the overnight favourite at around 11-10, but he could make the market for a bet on Washington at around 11-4. The form of his debut win over hurdles at Bangor is backed up by the clock and he won there with plenty in hand.",

        "content": "Stringent proof-of-vaccine measures are an attempt to prevent the \u2018incalculable loss\u2019 of lives that struck the area last winter\nThis week, Los Angeles embraced one of the strictest vaccine rules in the United States, requiring residents to show proof of full vaccination before entering restaurants, movie theaters, gyms and other public spaces.\nThe latest rules are expected to boost vaccination rates in the US\u2019 second most populous city. But they also prompted backlash. On Monday, demonstrators including municipal workers, police officers, dock workers, parents, and teachers protested in front of city hall, carrying signs reading \u201cFreedom Not Force!\u201d and \u201cMy body, my choice.\u201d\n\u201cThe upside of mandates, they definitely work,\u201d said Annette Regan, an expert in vaccine epidemiology at the University of California, Los Angeles. \u201cThe downside of the mandates is they can definitely polarize individuals.\u201d\nThis winter is expected to be a precarious time for Los Angeles, which was pummeled by Covid-19 last winter. At one point last December, one person was dying of Covid every 20 minutes. The county\u2019s public health director, Barbara Ferrer, broke down in tears at a briefing, over the \u201cincalculable loss\u201d of lives.\nThe region has been pushing strict Covid-19 prevention measures since then, and the new rules \u2013 combined with local, state, and federal rules requiring city employees, healthcare staff, and public schoolchildren to get vaccinated \u2013 means it will have some of the most stringent vaccine mandates in the nation.\nRegan said that across the US, including north of LA in San Francisco, mandates have proven effective at pushing many who were unsure about the vaccine to get inoculated, and she expects that the mandates in LA, too, will help boost immunization rates. By 12 November, 73% of residents in LA county, which includes the city and surrounding areas, were fully vaccinated and 80% were partially vaccinated.\nBut the mandates won\u2019t catch everyone.\nThe LA police union and a group of 500 local firefighters have already filed lawsuits over a mandate to be fully vaccinated by mid-December or submit to regular testing. So have aggrieved employees of the LA unified school district who oppose the requirement to get vaccinated by 15 November. And all the while, the city has been fielding for religious exemptions to the vaccine mandates, with residents pushing the already blurry lines that define \u201csincerely held\u201d objections to the vaccine.\nThe LA police department has so far received 2,233 religious exemption requests . Police chief Michel Moore has vowed to crack down on those refusing vaccinations, but also said \u201cto honor every exemption request, every request for accommodation possible\u201d.\nWhile encouraging officers to get the Covid-19 vaccination, LAPD Chief also says in new internal video -- that he's 'committed' to granting as many religious or medical exemptions as are possible for officers & employees under City's vaccine mandate. pic.twitter.com/892abk4bvM\n\u201cI think in California, we\u2019re not the wild west, but those are the origins of the state,\u201d said Shira Shafir, an infectious disease epidemiologist at UCLA. \u201cThere is a little bit of this fierce individualistic streak and autonomy above all.\u201d\nIn LA, and in many other cities across the US, that streak is running up against the realities of the pandemic, and a genuine desire to end it.\nThe opposition to the mandates is rearing as the region is bracing for what could be another winter surge. After low transmission rates throughout the summer, the number of infections has crept up again. Although hospitalization rates remain relatively low and flat, LA county has a case rate of about 98 per 100,000 residents, which the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) characterizes as a \u201csubstantial\u201d level of community transmission.\nFor the vaccine-hesitant, powerful agents of disinformation and misinformation have prevailed over the reality of the horrors the region lived through last winter, said Shafir.\nUntil the Covid-19 pandemic hit, many epidemiologists hypothesized that the effectiveness of vaccines was precisely what fueled vaccine hesitancy. In the cases of measles, chickenpox or polio, \u201cwe no longer see the disease, just the risks of the vaccines\u201d Shafir said. \u201cSo the risk-benefit calculation in people\u2019s minds is skewed.\u201d But that wasn\u2019t the case for Covid-19\u2019s impact in Los Angeles, she said. During the worst of the winter surge in January, the city brought in refrigerator trucks to hold dead bodies as morgues and funeral homes were overwhelmed.\n\u201cPeople have seen what the infection looks like and how devastating it can be,\u201d she said.\nStill, significant parts of the population are turning to religion and philosophy to shield themselves and their children from the requirements they distrust.\n\u201cThis is certainly a misuse of the religious exemptions,\u201d said Dorit Reiss, a law professor at \u200b\u200bthe University of California Hastings. \u201cThe religious exemption was not designed to give cover to people who are scared of vaccines. It was designed to \u200b\u200bprotect people from real discrimination.\u201d\nThe new requirements for patrons of local shops, restaurants and other businesses include a religious exemption as well, though the city stipulates that it will be up to individual businesses to decide whether to honor such exemptions \u2013 turning restaurant servers, yoga instructors and bartenders into de-facto bouncers. \u201cAnd that\u2019s an issue because your local barista has been trained to make an outstanding cappuccino, but they have not been trained to verify vaccine compliance.\u201d LA, like many cities across the US, has seen its share of angry customers violently opposing mask mandates.\nWorkers at restaurants, bars, shops and theaters are also the ones most at risk for contracting the virus and passing it onto their families, said Lorena Garcia, an associate professor of epidemiology at the UC Davis School of Medicine.\n\u201cMandates like this are really about protecting these workers and their communities,\u201d because one unvaccinated customer bringing the disease to a bartender would be all it took to not only infect that worker, but also their immunocompromised grandmother, their pregnant spouse or their young child. \u201cWorkers are shouldering a heavy burden,\u201d she said.\nCity officials are holding off enforcement until the end of November, at which point businesses could be fined thousands of dollars for not complying. On Friday, the city council voted to soften the original mandate, removing malls and shopping centers from the vaccine directive, and requiring proof of vaccination only for those 12 and over.",

        "content": "Campaigners in Devon celebrate return of passenger trains after 50 years, a first step to reversing the Beeching closures\nOn the rugged northern edge of Dartmoor, a small army of workers in high-vis vests is readying Okehampton station to welcome the first regular passenger train since 1972. The canopies and picket fences are being repainted in the original dark greens and warm yellows of the long-departed Southern Railway.\nIt\u2019s a historic moment for local campaigners, who have been fighting for decades to reconnect the Devon town to the national network and open up this lesser-visited part of the national park. \u201cIt\u2019s quite extraordinary \u2013 almost unbelievable,\u201d says Tom Baxter, 68, the secretary of the Dartmoor Railway Association, watching the painting from a gleaming green bench on the platform. \u201cI used to travel on the line when it was British Rail and I was here when it closed in the 1970s. Local railways were seen as a bit of a nuisance at the time \u2013 they wanted to get rid of them.\u201d\nThe Exeter to Okehampton line \u2013 known as the Dartmoor Line \u2013 is the first reopening under the government\u2019s \u00a3500m Restoring Your Railway programme, which aims to reinstate some of the services that were lost in the aftermath of the 1963 Beeching report commissioned by the Conservative government of the time, resulting in the closure of a third of the country\u2019s track network and more than half of all stations.\nThere are also plans to reopen the Northumberland line, which closed to passengers in 1964 as part of the Beeching era, when the automobile industry and roadbuilding lobby had the ear of successive governments. And there is a feasibility study on reinstating the Fleetwood-Poulton line in Lancashire. Overall, 38 schemes around the country have been given up to \u00a350,000 to develop businesses cases, with further funding available if they are approved.\nOn the other side of the track, Stuart Calvert, who has overseen the Dartmoor Line restoration for Network Rail, is checking the station before its reopening this week. \u201cThis is a real community project \u2013 and people are genuinely excited and delighted. It is opening up a part of the country that has not been well served: north Dartmoor rather than south Dartmoor,\u201d he says. \u201cFor leisure or business travellers or school or college students, it creates a world of possibilities.\u201d\nThe \u00a340m project, which has taken nine months, has involved the laying of 29,000 tonnes of ballast and 24,000 sleepers as well as the installation of five new radio masts and the clearing of miles of vegetation from the track. Although regular passenger services ended in the 1970s, freight trains continued to move stone from a quarry until 2011. Some passengers were able to travel on a limited Sunday service from the late 1990s.\nMany in the town centre are eager to use the new service. The reopening is the talk of local schools as it means trips to Exeter and Bristol and further afield are suddenly much easier. \u201cWhen you can\u2019t drive, it limits your independence,\u201d says Lyra Harrison, 17. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of excitement in the sixth form.\u201d\nHelen Howard, 60, says it will give Okehampton a new lease of life. \u201cIt will open up this town, which has been stagnant for quite a long time,\u201d she says. \u201cIt will give people an opportunity to get into Exeter without sitting in queues of traffic. People will be able to use it as a commuter service. It\u2019s all-around positive.\u201d\nThe government\u2019s plans to reopen stations are backed by public transport experts but there are reservations about the scale of the funding. Norman Baker, a former junior transport minister, who now advises the Campaign for Better Transport, points out that the sums involved are dwarfed by the \u00a327bn for road building. \u201cIt is good news, and the government does seem to be serious about reopening lines. But the \u00a3500m government has allocated [for the programme] won\u2019t go very far,\u201d he says. \u201cThe government should use some of the enormous sum allocated to the roadbuilding programme to reopen railway lines. That would be much more sensible.\u201d\nIncreasing passenger numbers on public transport is one of the fastest ways to reduce the country\u2019s transport emissions, which account for more greenhouse gasses than any other sector. \u201cWe can make progress tomorrow by getting people on buses and trains,\u201d says Baker. \u201cAnd part of that is the cost of travelling by train and bus, which is going up way above inflation, whereas we\u2019ve seen air passenger duty cut and the cost of fuel duty frozen for 12 years.\u201d\nBack in Okehampton, Baxter is in the station\u2019s tiny museum, which he helped establish. On the nearly 150-year-old wall is a thick, woollen British Rail coat worn by the last station manager and a closure notice promising residents five buses a day.\nHe is glad that a new chapter is being written in the town\u2019s history. \u201cIt became a bypassed town after the line closed,\u201d he says. \u201cNow Okehampton will become the railhead for the whole of west Devon and north Cornwall.\u201d",

In the most prominent case, in Virginia, Republicans this month won back the governor\u2019s mansion in a campaign focused on the supposed dangers of critical race theory in state schools.\nCritical race theory, an academic discipline that examines the ways in which racism operates in US laws and society, is not taught in public schools in Virginia. Regardless, the Republican candidate for governor, Glenn Youngkin, promised to ban it.\nIn Texas, Matt Krause, chair of the state committee on general investigating and a Republican candidate for attorney general, wrote to schools, saying \u201cstudents, parents and taxpayers\u201d had asked to have certain books removed.\nSchools were asked to note any books that could \u201cmake students feel discomfort, guilt, anguish, or any other form of psychological distress because of their race or sex\u201d, or \u201cconvey that a student, by virtue of their race or sex, is inherently racist, sexist, or oppressive\u201d.\nMany books on the list deal with race, sex or LGBTQ+ issues, with the majority concerning LGBTQ+ topics, the Chronicle reported.\nKrause also asked districts to identify additional books on subjects including sexually transmitted diseases, sexually explicit images and graphic presentations of sexual behavior.\nLast Wednesday, the Texas governor, Greg Abbott, directed the state education agency to investigate criminal activity related to \u201cthe availability of pornography\u201d in schools.\nReferring to two memoirs with LGBTQ+ characters and scenes of sexual activity, Abbott has also asked state education officials to develop statewide standards to prevent \u201cpornography\u201d and \u201cother obscene content in Texas public schools\u201d.\nSuch moves have sparked anger and confusion.\nOvidia Molina, president of the Texas State Teachers Association, criticized \u201cdisturbing and political overreach into the classroom\u201d.\n\u201cThis is an obvious attack on diversity and an attempt to score political points at the expense of our children\u2019s education,\u201d she said.\nSome Democrats and lawyers encouraged school districts not to respond to the letter from Krause, as it does not have the legal force of a subpoena.\n\u201cThe letter is an unofficial request, and as such we are not going to respond to it,\u201d Robyn L Harris, a spokeswoman for the Dallas school district, told the Chronicle.\n\u201cAfter doing more legal research, we\u2019ve decided that a response is not necessary, especially since anyone can search our library catalogs on this website,\u201d said an Austin school districts spokesman, Jason Stanford.",

The Liberal Democrats\u2019 foreign affairs spokesperson said in a statement: \u201cWith MPs from other parties, I worked on the detention of political prisoners in Saudi Arabia with Bindmans.\n\u201cI deeply regret that I \u2018Zoomed\u2019 in for one meeting from my office in parliament when Covid restrictions were in place.

The former attorney-general denies breaking the rules by using the Commons for his legal work.\nCox earned at least \u00a36m from his second job since he entered parliament, a Guardian analysis revealed this week, while records show that he skipped 12 recent votes on days when he was doing paid legal work.",

        "content": "If the Black Caps can end their poor form against Australia, the game they wanted least could also yield the sweetest victory\nIf New Zealanders had a choice of opponent in Sunday\u2019s T20 World Cup final, the average preference would surely be anyone but Australia.\nThis isn\u2019t about the power dynamics of relative size, because New Zealand\u2019s defining characteristic as a cricket team has become the ability to match up against opponents with even more economic and population disparity than there is between the bookends of the Tasman Sea. But for other less tangible reasons, whether or not they involve the regional friendship and rivalry between the countries, Australia are indisputably New Zealand\u2019s bogey side, the team that beats the Black Caps no matter how well either side is going. The past doesn\u2019t always define the future, and there is of course no reason why this New Zealand team couldn\u2019t be the one to break the pattern. A similar hold ended at this same tournament, when Pakistan ignored decades of World Cup losses to India with a powerful 10-wicket pasting. But the historical record includes very recent history, and it remains another obstacle to overcome.\nThe bogey dynamic was never more potent than in the 50-over World Cup in 2015. After rampaging through the tournament with a devastating scoring rate and equally furious spells of bowling, New Zealand crashed in the final when the other team wore green and gold. At the end of that same year, after decades of Test losses in Australia, New Zealand had been on a roll in Test cricket, dominating at home and winning tough series overseas. Yet they were flattened in Brisbane, lost in Adelaide, and went on to lose in Wellington and Christchurch, for a pair of 2-0 losses home and away. It was the same story in 2019-20, playing brilliantly against all other comers around the world but folding 3-0 when visiting Australia.\nDifferent year, different format, different tournament. But that New Zealand have played so well so far, the way they thumped India, the energy of their semi-final triumph over favourites England, and that Australia have been less convincing through the group stage, all go out the window when the two teams face off.\nOne thing that won\u2019t be so different is the players involved. New Zealand\u2019s big four - Kane Williamson, Martin Guptill, Tim Southee and Trent Boult - all played in the losing 2015 50-over final. Seven members of Australia\u2019s inevitable XI played against New Zealand in that campaign, and six in the final.\nAustralia\u2019s push will rely heavily on their pace-bowling trio. None of Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood, or Pat Cummins has ever played New Zealand in 20-over cricket, but each has a dominant record against them across 50 overs. Aaron Finch and David Warner have made plenty of runs against the Kiwis batting at the top. Warner is back in top gear after his flying start in the semi-final win over Pakistan. Matthew Wade and Marcus Stoinis will be brimming with confidence after sealing that win as batting finishers. And Glenn Maxwell has barely been called upon, left not out without facing a ball in two of Australia\u2019s group games.\nOutside the big names, so much will rely on Adam Zampa. The leg-spinner has dominated the middle overs with smart bowling and confidence, and is the leading wicket-taker since the main stage of the tournament began with 12 in his six matches. He first proved his worth to national selectors by dominating one-day matches in New Zealand in 2016, and had the last meaningful pre-pandemic act in cricket in March 2020 when he bowled Williamson with a perfect wrong \u2019un before the New Zealanders abandoned their tour of Australia to beat a closing border back home. He will fear no one come Sunday.\nFor New Zealand, their spin duo of Mitchell Santner and Ish Sodhi will be equally important. Australian teams have consistently been undone by spin through the middle overs, when the scoring rate is clamped down and wickets follow. They may play a bigger part than the celebrated opening pace partnership of Boult and Southee, given just how familiar Australia\u2019s players - especially those who have faced Boult repeatedly in the IPL - will be with how those two operate.\nThen there comes the damaging blow for New Zealand of missing Devon Conway, who dealt himself a wound by punching his bat when he was dismissed in the semi-final, breaking a small bone in his hand when his strike missed the padding of his glove. It is a self-inflicted injury that his team could ill afford, given his importance to the middle order, and his importance in the World Test Championship win earlier this year that broke New Zealand\u2019s trophy drought.\nUltimately, the Kiwis will have to remember the versatility they have showed in becoming a team bigger than the sum of its parts, to get past the fact that one vital part is missing. Daryl Mitchell has done a brilliant job as a pinch-hitting opener. Jimmy Neesham won the semi-final for them with firepower down the order.\nWhoever is called upon to do a job must do it. If this team can hold its nerve to end the sequence of underperformance against Australia, the match-up that they would be most concerned about could also yield the sweetest victory.",

Their plea comes days after Jeremy Hunt, another former foreign secretary, called for the money to be paid.\nRifkind said that there was no dispute that the sum is due to Iran and that the main problem has been staying in line with international sanctions. \u201cI find it difficult to believe that there is not some way through this particular problem,\u201d he said. \u201cI would very much hope that a way through this can be found. We all know what the Iranians are doing and why they\u2019re doing it. They do it not just in relation to Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, but to many others \u2013 taking hostages for political purposes. It\u2019s very distasteful having to deal with that.\n\u201cI would be more despondent if there was a dispute about whether the debt is due in the first place. If that was in dispute, then, like anybody else, I would be very reluctant to give into that kind of blackmail. But the issue is whether there\u2019s a procedure that can enable us to transfer the funds. And it ought to be possible to find a way through that.\u201d\nJack Straw, the former Labour foreign secretary, said: \u201cThe money should have been paid back years ago. I know for certain that in practice, there is no direct impediment on it being paid. There is no question in my mind, I can\u2019t speak for anybody else, that it\u2019s caught up in the issue of Nazanin\u2019s release.\u201d\nIt has also emerged that in a 2014 Commons debate, Ben Wallace, the current defence secretary, described the unpaid debt as \u201cnot only a sorry story, but un-British in that the process \u2026 has been marred by double dealing and obfuscation\u201d.\nHowever, some sources who had dealt with the issue of the debt over the years warned that there were genuine complications in repaying it. \u201cThere is no dispute that this money belongs to Iran,\u201d said a source. \u201cIt has been held in a court escrow account for a long time. The questions are around exactly how much the sum due is (it has 40 years of interest and various other elements that have to be calculated) and how it could lawfully be transferred.\u201d\nThey cited concerns that the money could end up in the hands of those under sanctions, fears about the US\u2019s reaction to the money being paid, the moral issues in handing money to a regime funding terrorism in the region and the practical issues of finding a bank willing to hand over the money, given the possible US reaction.",

England have had bigger victories over Australia but a display of twinkling promise from their new fly-half Marcus Smith and an eighth successive red rose win in this fixture since 2016 sent the majority of the crowd away optimistic about the home side\u2019s medium-term future.\nEddie Jones always enjoys getting one over on his former employers and, given the Covid-19 disruption on the eve of the game, this result will give him as much pleasure as any. After Ireland\u2019s fine effort against New Zealand it would have been instructive to see the All Blacks on English turf this week, but the world champion Springboks will still be a useful barometer of the true autumnal worth of Jones\u2019s reshaped side.\nIf there is still a nagging suspicion that playing a couple more players in their best positions would make a massive difference, Smith can clearly be his country\u2019s first-choice No 10 for many years. The Harlequin man\u2019s first completed pass created a fine score for the man of the match, Freddie Steward, after just seven minutes, and despite some muscular attention from the Wallaby midfield he was a consistently lively presence. Henry Slade, deployed largely in the back field but given licence to roam, had a conspicuous first 40 minutes while Kyle Sinckler, Courtney Lawes and Tom Curry all worked their dark blue socks off.\nFive penalties from Owen Farrell was also a decent return, tarnished only by the sight of the skipper limping off with an ankle problem with 12 minutes left. It was certainly a visually striking occasion, with the RFU having commissioned a pre-match sound and light show far removed from the regimental bandsmen of yore. Amid the searchlights and fireworks England were led out by Maro Itoje, winning his 50th cap on a stage that would have caused even his new celebrity mate Jay-Z to raise an admiring eyebrow.\nNot everything remained as dazzling once the game kicked off, but the mood was still reminiscent, for those of a certain vintage, of another significant England contest with Australia at Twickenham in 1988, when England had just appointed a marketable new captain in Will Carling and a 28-19 victory felt like the start of a bright new era. A distinct sense of expectancy certainly hung in the air and Smith, who had looked encouragingly sharp in the warm-up, did not waste time making his mark.\nWith Farrell inside him he received the ball at second receiver but, in theory, the Wallaby defence had most bases covered. They reckoned without Smith\u2019s ability to manipulate the space in front of him, a perfectly timed little double pump pass to the thundering Steward giving the big full-back the chance to swerve past the cover and register his first Test try.\nThe signs were distinctly ominous for an Australia side that never really threatened the home tryline. After a flurry of penalties from Farrell and James O\u2019Connor, England were only denied another eye-catching score when Jamie George, put away by a neat Lawes pass, was stopped in front of the posts by an illegal shoulder from winger Tom Wright. It cost Wright 10 minutes in the sin-bin and in his absence the traffic was virtually all one way.\nSoon afterwards the heavily-involved George was only denied a try by a desperate late intervention from Nic White and, in most respects, the Wallabies were hanging on for dear life. The final penalty count of 18 to nine against the visitors reflected the balance of the contest and England, 16-12 up at the interval, should have been much further ahead. Even the free-running Slade, in acres of space with Jonny May outside him, will look back and reflect that England did not take all the chances they carved out, with a quick tap effort by Ben Youngs also ruled out.\nAustralia, nevertheless, would have trotted in at half time proud of the way they had scrambled and dug in. They were disappointing in Scotland and their two wins over South Africa this year merely reinforced the importance of having all their best players available. Samu Kerevi would have made a difference and, with two of their frontline props injured, much rested on the shoulders of James Slipper, playing his first Test at tight-head since 2012.\nGiven this was his 113th Test, that is a long old time between drinks, but this was a career coming full circle. On his debut Slipper was required to come off the bench and prop on both sides of the scrum against dominant English opposition and this was a definite case of deja vu. With Allan Alaalatoa and Taniela Tupou both recovering from head injuries and Ollie Hoskins of London Irish only a late addition to the squad, his 67 minutes on the field amounted to another significant display of character.\nEven after the equally defiant Angus Bell was shown a 48th minute yellow card for upending Lawes, it was a similarly stubborn story. Australia could have closed to within a point at 19-18 had a penalty against Lawes not been reversed for a seatbelt tackle by Pete Samu, but Farrell\u2019s fifth penalty with 15 minutes left and a 73rd minute three-pointer from Smith soothed any fluttering English nerves before a galloping last minute score from Jamie Blamire, the replacement hooker\u2019s fourth try in as many Tests, finally raised the roof.",

Perhaps best to play him in his best position, though. 6\n13 Henry Slade Spent a lot of time at wing or full-back and, while he showed his quality, looked a square peg in a round hole at times. 6\n12 Owen Farrell (capt) A solid return to the side but, if he limps off, then it\u2019s a safe bet he is hurt. A concern, with South Africa due here next week. 6\n11 Jonny May Did not make the most of one promising opportunity in the first half and was subdued thereafter. 5\n10 Marcus Smith Not bad. Kicked too much early on but showed his ability when putting Steward away. Forced things a little. 7\n9 Ben Youngs Kicked well and distribution on the money, including one fizzed long pass when falling backwards. 7\n1 Bevan Rodd Needless early penalty against but responded with strong carry in Australia\u2019s 22. Brought some ballast to the scrum, too on impressive debut. 8\n2 Jamie George Rampaging run up the middle, just when England were going quiet. But dropped one over the line and was injured in the process. 6\n3 Kyle Sinckler Plenty of grunt but his delicate touch with ball in hand sets him apart and grew in influence as match wore on. 8\n4 Maro Itoje Not his most disciplined of performances but upped his game when Australia threatened a comeback. 6\n5 Jonny Hill Strong carry early in the second half but ultimately held up. Slowly but surely growing in stature at this level. 7\n6 Courtney Lawes As usual, lovely footwork to buy himself an extra yard. England\u2019s most consistent forward at present. 7\n7 Sam Underhill Not one of his more conspicuous matches but perhaps hard to make an impact when breakdown was such a mess. 6\n8 Tom Curry A lot of work, though yet to convince fully at No 8 and Dombrandt\u2019s cameo showed what a specialist can do when given the chance. 7\n15 Kurtley Beale Beaten a little easily for Steward\u2019s try and endured a frustrating afternoon, finding himself on the end of too many loose passes. 5\n14 Andrew Kellaway The former Northampton wing had a big impact on the Rugby Championship but hasn\u2019t been able to bring that form north. 5\n13 Len Ikitau Has \u201ceffort\u201d emblazoned on his wristband and there was no lack of it. Almost caught England napping but Smith was alert to it. 6\n12 Hunter Paisami Levelled Smith in the first half to force the knock on, and made a scything break in the second. 7\n11 Tom Wright Can have no complaints over yellow card \u2013 which felt the correct sanction \u2013 and fumbled the ball when well placed to dart down the left. 4\n10 James O\u2019Connor Goal-kicking was on the money from the off and, having sat far too deep against Scotland, brought a better balance to his game. 6\n9 Nic White Busy and industrious throughout and came up with a remarkable tackle to deny George a try. 7\n1 Angus Bell Mindless tip tackle on Lawes earned himself a yellow card when Australia were just a point behind. 4\n2 Folau Fainga\u2019a One or two wobbles at lineout time and missed a couple of tackles before being replaced. 5\n3 James Slipper Gave up one scrum penalty to Rodd but responded well and kept on toiling away at the coal face. 6\n4 Rory Arnold Brings a bit of muscle to the Wallabies pack and made some important metres in heavy traffic. 6\n5 Izack Rodda Silly breakdown penalty against but was disruptive at the lineout and a general thorn in England\u2019s side. 7\n6 Rob Leota Provided a lineout option and showed up well as a carrying option but his discipline was a problem. 6\n7 Michael Hooper (capt) Effort and energy in abundance, as we have come to expect. Was the game\u2019s top tackler when he limped off after 55 minutes. 7\n8 Rob Valetini Made a monstrous tackle on Youngs when England were threatening and made a couple of dents. 6",

        "content": "Lewis Hamilton\u2019s Formula One world championship hopes hung by the slenderest of threads after he was disqualified from Friday\u2019s qualifying at the Brazilian Grand Prix. Yet with typical indomitable fortitude the world champion refused to accept his fate. He delivered an exceptional performance in Saturday\u2019s sprint to give himself a chance to keep his title hopes alive at Interlagos and stay in touch with Max Verstappen.\nF1 had scrupulously followed its rules in punishing Hamilton but it was impossible to ignore the sense of disappointment that accompanied the likelihood that the most exciting title fight for years might be decided in the stewards\u2019 room rather than on the track. Hamilton described the decision as \u201cdevastating\u201d but had no intention of throwing in the towel.\nRelegated to the back of the grid after the FIA confirmed his Mercedes team had broken regulations in their rear wing drag reduction system (DRS) during Friday\u2019s qualifying, Hamilton gave a masterclass in controlled, aggressive driving to move from 20th to fifth in just 24 laps. The sprint was won by his teammate Valtteri Bottas, who will start from pole, with Verstappen in second.\n\u201cI just tried to get as far up as possible, then all of a sudden, I was chipping away at it much faster,\u201d Hamilton said. \u201cYou just can\u2019t give up. You just have to keep going.\u201d\nSo quick and so precise was Hamilton that what had appeared to be an insurmountable task is now all to play for. He scythed through the field, including an absolutely bravura pass on Lando Norris through turn one on the final lap to take fifth, but the challenge remains significant.\nWith his grid penalty for taking a new engine earlier in the weekend applied he will start the grand prix from 10th. Yet such was his pace that making a tilt at the front with a full 71 laps to play with is within his grasp.\nA bullish Mercedes team principal, Toto Wolff, was hugely pleased with the result especially as he felt his team had been harshly treated. \u201cFuck them all,\u201d he said to Hamilton as he crossed the line. Wolff insisted the comment was not aimed at the stewards but rather an expression of building up resilience.\nHe believed the attention to the Mercedes wing brought by Red Bull and the refusal to allow for what he believed was damage incurred during its use was unfair. \u201cIn a way there was a gentleman\u2019s agreement that exists, now it doesn\u2019t any more,\u201d he noted before celebrating Hamilton\u2019s performance. \u201cToday it reminded me why I love this sport,\u201d he added. \u201cEverything is possible, we have everything to play for tomorrow.\u201d\nHamilton trails Verstappen by 21 points with four rounds, including today\u2019s, remaining and 104 points available. Before the sprint Verstappen looked all set to open a chasm to the world champion, now the fight remains on albeit with the numbers still stacked up against the British driver. If Verstappen scores three points more than Hamilton on Sunday he could finish second to him in the three remaining meetings and still take his first title.\nHamilton\u2019s team were found to have breached the technical regulation during the qualifying on Friday that decided the grid for the sprint race. His punishment was finally confirmed on Saturday afternoon and Mercedes have stated they will not appeal. Verstappen too had been drawn into the protracted steward\u2019s enquiry and was fined \u20ac50,000 (\u00a343,500) for touching Hamilton\u2019s car after qualifying.\nFor Mercedes it was a technical infringement that was not intentional. The rear wing passed the FIA test before qualifying but failed to do so afterwards. The stewards confirmed they believed there had been no deliberate rule breaking, reporting there was \u201cno question of any intent to exceed the maximum dimension either by action or design\u201d. However, they did state the issue was likely caused by a \u201cplay in parts\u201d (contact between different elements), a fault with the mechanism or incorrect assembly.\nWolff said the team were convinced that the wing had been damaged but it had yet to be returned to them for inspection. It was a huge blow for Mercedes. Since the turbo-hybrid era began in 2014 they have been dominant and performed operationally and mechanically at an exceptionally high standard.\nThe sequence of events had begun after qualifying finished on Friday at 2pm in Brazil and only concluded a full 19 hours later. With Hamilton having secured pole for the sprint race with a dominant performance, Red Bull lodged a complaint about the DRS. Mercedes were then summoned to the stewards after the FIA technical delegate, Jo Bauer, had inspected and found an infringement.\nThe DRS opens a flap in the wing, reducing drag and allowing the car to go car faster in a straight line. The gap is mandated to be no more than 85mm and Hamilton\u2019s was found to be marginally larger.\nThe stewards investigated and Mercedes put their case, and the intrigue only ratcheted up when Verstappen and Red Bull were also summoned to the stewards. They were called to explain a breach of the parc ferm\u00e9 rules that forbid the touching or checking of cars once qualifying is complete. Footage filmed by a fan had emerged of Verstappen inspecting and touching the rear wing of his car and then Hamilton\u2019s under parc ferm\u00e9 conditions and he was duly fined.\nThe process ground on, only finally reaching its conclusion shortly before the sprint began, and for that brief period Hamilton\u2019s title hopes looked absolutely forlorn. Then he took to the track, once more refused to be bowed and is on absolutely fighting form for Sunday\u2019s race.",

        "content": "Critically endangered North Atlantic right whales are dying in alarming numbers after getting caught in lobster trap ropes\nA fierce fight is being waged in the Gulf of Maine between lobster fishers desperate to maintain their way of life and conservationists who argue that the waters are a vital haven for the threatened North Atlantic right whale.\nLast month, a federal judge in Maine rejected a federal ban on lobstering in a section of the Gulf of Maine that is meant to protect the whales.\nThe decision reflects the tense battle between a centuries-long lobstering industry \u2013 and bedrock of the local economy \u2013 that is fighting for its survival and conservation groups, who argue lobster fishing in the area has had detrimental effects on an endangered species who have been injured and killed by the fishing equipment.\nOn 17 October, District Judge Lance Walker ruled in favor of several lobstering bodies including the Maine Lobstering Union when he rejected a four-month federal ban that would have prevented lobstering from continuing on offshore fishing grounds in the Gulf of Maine. Lobster industry advocates argued that there was insufficient evidence to prove that the whales frequented the area.\nWalker questioned the federal statistical models used to evaluate the risk of whales becoming entangled in lobster fishing equipment. According to him, federal regulators from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration used \u201cmarkedly thin\u201d modeling to prove the whales\u2019 presence in the thousand-square mile area off the Maine coast.\nLobstering advocates such Virginia Olsen of the Maine Lobstering Union praised Walker for his decision, saying, \u201cwe felt like someone actually took a look at that data that we had been looking at and finally came to some of the same conclusions.\n\u201cWe felt like this was a step that was going to hurt our fishery, our communities,\u201d Olsen said, referring to the federal ban. \u201cWhat we needed as fishermen was some validation that what we were doing was actually in the best interest of the right whale \u2026 and we didn\u2019t feel like the seasonal closure was that right step,\u201d she added.\nMaine\u2019s $1.4bn lobster industry has for decades been the lifeline for numerous lobster fishers including Olsen herself. But conservationists see its lobstering practices as a significant factor in the reduction of right whale populations over the years.\nIn data released last month, the North Atlantic Right Whale Consortium revealed that in 2019, the right whale numbered 366, before dropping to 336 in 2020, the lowest number in nearly 20 years. Entanglement is a leading cause of death among right whales.\nThe consortium cited human activities as the driving force behind the species\u2019 extinction, as 86% of identified right whales have been entangled one or more times in fishing gear.\n\u201cWhen they encounter a vertical line that\u2019s in the water, there\u2019s a buoy on the surface and then there\u2019s a string of up to twenty traps on the seafloor \u2026 [The whales] generally can\u2019t see the ropes and it\u2019s very violent. The whale will thrash in the water and at the surface, trying to escape,\u201d said Gib Brogan, a fisheries campaign manager at Oceana, an international ocean conservation group.\nRopes entangling the whales can dig into their flesh, and wrap around their mouths, preventing them from feeding, breeding and socializing, Brogan said. . Entangled whales, especially young calves, may drown if they cannot reach the surface; others die slowly of starvation.\n\u201cWhat the government is saying is that [the Gulf of Maine] may not be an aggregation area. [Rather] it may be a pathway as the whales are migrating from either the eastern Gulf of Maine or the Gulf of St Lawrence \u2026 This is a time and place where a lot of whales are using this as their habitat \u2026 which have a lot of functions. It can be a breeding, feeding and socializing area,\u201d Brogan said.\nNoaa has appealed Walker\u2019s order, arguing that the lobster unions and dealers failed to provide evidence of irreparable harm that the closure of the waters would have on them. It also argued that the lobstering bodies did not provide hard evidence that the closure would result in economic havoc.\nOver the years, ropeless fishing has been promoted as an alternative to lobstermen that would pose less risk to whales. Instead of using the traditional lines that connect traps on the seafloor to a buoy, ropeless traps can be raised to the surface by remote control.\nHowever, the industry has not yet widely embraced this method, with many such as Olsen citing ropeless fishing\u2019s availability, cost and safety as major concerns. A ropeless trap costs about $4,000, while a traditional lobster trap costs between $80 and $180.\nThe National Marine Fisheries Service loans experimental gear technology to collaborating fishers, but Noaa expects a maximum of only 330 ropeless traps to be available coastwide \u2013 from Maine to Florida \u2013 in the coming years.\nSome groups are calling for collaboration between the two sides. Erica Fuller, a senior attorney at the Conservation Law Foundation, said promoting new methods of fishing \u2013 and providing the means for lobstermen to adopt them \u2013 would help solve the fight.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think any conservationist would say that ropeless fishing is ready today, nor is it affordable yet. But we have to get there,\u201d said Fuller. \u201cWhat in a collaborative fashion would be helpful would be if fishermen that might be otherwise closed out of a certain area or fishermen who generally want to be part of a solution would try on some of this gear \u2026 Based on fishermen\u2019s feedback, we get the best gear modifications.\n\u201cIf Maine wants to play a more collaborative role in trying to move that transition forward, that would certainly be an area where we do everything in our power to help those fishermen,\u201d she added.",

The scale and savagery of the violence between rival drug trafficking gangs vying for control of prisons has stunned the country.\nThe latest carnage was no exception. Videos on social media purportedly posted by inmates overnight showed victims being beaten and burned alive in a prison courtyard.\nOther videos showed detainees begging for help to stop the violence as shots and explosions rang out in the background. The Guardian could not independently verify the origin of the videos.\nThe outbreak was triggered by a power vacuum after a gang leader\u2019s release, according to Pablo Arosemena, the governor of Guayas province where Guayaquil is located. \u201cOther cell blocks with other groups wanted to subdue them, get inside and have a total massacre,\u201d he said in a press conference on Saturday.\nEcuador\u2019s president, Guillermo Lasso, took to Twitter on Saturday to lambast judges. He accused them of restricting the state\u2019s ability to combat the violence by limiting a 60-day state of emergency in the prison system \u2013 declared at the end of September \u2013 which aimed to free funding and allow heightened controls with military assistance.\n\u201cThe state\u2019s fundamental duty is to guarantee the life of citizens, without discrimination. It is a fundamental human right,\u201d Lasso tweeted. \u201cUnfortunately, today that job has been made impossible by judicial decisions which impose exaggerated restrictions on the coordination between the state security forces to defend life. They do not allow us to defend life,\u201d he said.\nLasso, a 65-year-old former banker, said the state needed the \u201cconstitutional tools to protect the population, retake order in the prisons and fight against the mafias that profit from the chaos\u201d.\nCol Mario Pazmi\u00f1o, the former director of Ecuador\u2019s military intelligence, said the latest violence demonstrated that the government was unable to \u201ccombat the threat which has spiralled out of control long ago\u201d.\nThe violence spiked when local criminal gangs started working for the rival Mexican Sinaloa and Jalisco New Generation drug cartels, he added. \u201cThe level of corruption is so high that the prison staff and officers are totally corrupted and the prisoners run the jail,\u201d Pazmi\u00f1o added. \u201cIt is total chaos.\u201d\nThe situation was worsened by an \u201cinoperative justice system\u201d which meant many prisoners were jailed before sentencing, Pazmi\u00f1o said, leading to overcrowding and the mixing of highly dangerous criminals with prisoners jailed for alleged theft or drug use.\nA total of 11 people were found hanged in the same prison in October. The authorities have said they may have been suicides.\nPolice operations since the state of emergency was declared \u2013 especially in the Litoral penitentiary \u2013 have uncovered stashes of guns, grenades, knives, munitions, mobile phones and drugs.",

They join Brazil, Denmark, France and Germany among the first five countries to qualify for next year\u2019s finals, and travel to Cardiff on Tuesday to face Wales, who beat Belarus 5-1.\n\u201cWe are super-happy to qualify and to do it in front of our home fans makes it extra special,\u201d Carrasco said afterwards. \u201cWe must now keep working to improve as a team and to give ourselves a chance to achieve something at the World Cup.\u201d\nKylian Mbapp\u00e9 scored his first international hat-trick inside 32 minutes as France picked apart Kazakhstan 8-0 in Group D and booked their place in the finals. Karim Benzema added two in the second-half, Adrien Rabiot headed a sixth, Antoine Griezmann made it seven with an 84th-minute penalty \u2013 and there was still time for Mbapp\u00e9 to hit his fourth as Kazakhstan crumbled.\nDidier Deschamps praised what was an effervescent performance, singling out France\u2019s front line, who ripped the visitors apart with crisp one-touch passing.\n\u201cThe aim was to qualify, but we did it in style too and you could see the enjoyment the players got from playing together and how they shared things, notably the forwards,\u201d said the coach. \u201cIt\u2019s good, everyone got their slice of the cake. It\u2019s a result that rewards everything we did well in both halves. The risk at half-time is to drop off a bit, but we continued, that\u2019s also about respecting your opponent.\u201d\nMbapp\u00e9, who was instrumental in winning the 2018 tournament in Russia, added: \u201cWe wanted to give ourselves a chance to defend our title. Even for those who have played in it and won it, it\u2019s an ultimate dream to play in a World Cup. The fans enjoyed it, so did we. We respected the game and our opponents. We wanted to keep going right to the end.\u201d\nTen-man Finland rekindled their hopes of reaching Qatar with a gritty 3-1 victory at Bosnia and Herzegovina.

The result leaves the Finns second on 11 points from seven games.\nNorway being held to a surprise 0-0 Group G draw at home against Latvia meant the Netherlands needed a win against Montenegro to seal their place - but two late goals denied them. A Memphis Depay double had them two up at the break but goals from Ilija Vukotic and Nikola Vujnovic meant the Netherlands must wait.\nTheir captain, Virgil van Dijk, called their second-half display \u201cscandalous\u201d, Depay branded it \u201csuper dumb\u201d and coach Louis van Gaal \u201cinexplicable\u201d.\nVan Gaal said he had to take some blame for his late substitutions, aimed at resting some players who had picked up knocks, but added: \u201cI cannot really explain what happened. This leaves a bad aftertaste but I\u2019m not going to criticise my players. They also really want to go to the World Cup. We are still in the best position.\u201d\nVan Dijk said: \u201cI\u2019m speechless and angry. It was scandalous the way we played in the second half. We all want to have the ball, play football, attack and score. But sometimes you also have to think defensively too. We should have kept control and not all run forward. We did. If it has to be ugly, then it has to be ugly.\u201d\nTurkey are second on 18 points after Halil Dervisoglu struck twice in three first-half minutes on the way to a 6-0 thrashing of 10-man Gibraltar, who are still searching for their first-ever points in World Cup qualification, having lost all of their 19 outings to date.\nSadio Man\u00e9, meanwhile, will return to Liverpool for X-rays on a rib injury he sustained on Thursday in Senegal\u2019s match against Togo in African qualifying.",

        "content": "A tight labour market and high inflation may see real wages growth for some, but ongoing uncertainty for many\n\nFor several months now, policymakers at the Bank of England have been agonising about wages. They ask themselves how workers will react when they see rising prices in the shops and, worse, the rocketing cost of petrol, which last week jumped to its highest level on record.\nWill they march into their boss\u2019s office and demand a pay rise of 10%? Or, more likely, will they march down the road to a rival employer prepared to increase wages by double digits to attract new staff?\nIn such a scenario, when forced to pay ever-higher wages, employers will need to increase shop prices further. It\u2019s a wage-price spiral that gives BoE officials sleepless nights and makes them think they have lost control of an economy that is supposed to glide forward with inflation anchored for the foreseeable future at about 2%.\nOn Tuesday, figures for the three months to the end of September from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) are expected to show a slide in annual wages growth from 7.2%, including bonuses, to somewhere nearer 5%.\nThe reason for the drop can be found in the large distortion of wages figures last year following the first lockdown. Cuts in hours meant wages fell \u2013 and fast. That meant the economic recovery would always bring with it a steep increase in pay. In August, the official figures put wages growth at more than 8%.\nQuite rightly, Bank of England officials discounted the artificially inflated increases that appeared in the monthly figures, and agreed with the ONS that a truer figure could be found in the underlying wage rises \u2013 of about 3% to 3.5%.\nMany industries have also paused production or delayed processing orders to cope with staff shortages and delays to vital imports, especially of components such as computer chips. Demand may be high, both domestically and from abroad, for British goods and services, but the figures show UK firms struggling more than their counterparts in other countries to meet that demand.\nThere is an argument that this is all about to change. The ONS is expected to report that unemployment fell again in September, and HMRC data for October could show that most people still on furlough at the end of the scheme were retained by their employers.\nA tighter labour market and still record high levels of vacancies could, after a decade of false starts, begin to push average wages much higher.\nInflation figures to be published by the ONS on Wednesday will also play a part. Many City analysts have forecast an increase to about 4% in October, showing that a dip to 3.1% in September was a brief interruption to a relentlessly upward trend.\nOnce workers begin to see inflation surging past 4%, average wages growth could head back towards 10%. In areas where there is a chronic shortage of skilled staff, such as among computer engineers, there is every likelihood that pay will increase. The same goes for hotel staff and other areas of a hospitality industry sideswiped by the pandemic and the exodus of EU workers following the government\u2019s hard Brexit deal.\nThe UK has not seen such low numbers of unemployed people for every vacancy since the 1960s \u2013 the days when a construction worker could hand in their notice in the morning and cross the road to another building site for a 10% pay rise.\nIt\u2019s possible this form of worker power will re-emerge in the manufacturing and construction sectors. But if it does, it will probably be short-lived. And it will largely bypass service industries, where most people work, and where the impact of the pandemic is still uncertain.\nForecasts of a temporary spike in pay should mean Bank officials stick with the current low rates of interest. If they do put rates up, it won\u2019t be long before they put them down again.",

The NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service has a policy to source the names of all new parks from Aboriginal communities.\nSunday\u2019s announcement follows a report last year, conducted by independent historian Dr Mark Dunn, who confirmed Boyd\u2019s involvement in blackbirding and found it was viewed as a form of slavery at the time.\nBoyd arrived in Australia in 1842 with the clear purpose of building a pastoral and business empire, Dunn\u2019s report states.\nBoyd quickly amassed a huge property empire, with landholdings throughout the Riverina and Monaro regions, as well as central and south-west Victoria. He became one of the largest landholders in Australia, outside of the Crown, and complained frequently about the lack of available workers, particularly for his pastoral operations.\nIn 1847, five years after his arrival in Australia, he sent ships to Vanuatu and New Caledonia to source workers. He brought a total of 192 men and women to NSW to work on his estates and ships that year.\n\u201cHis schemes were controversial at the time and viewed as a form of slavery by many of his contemporary critics,\u201d Dunn wrote in his report. \u201cHis methods used in securing the labourers were considered to be coercive and the second voyage descended into extreme violence when his ships bombarded the villages, killing numerous Islanders.\u201d\nTwo years later, his businesses failing, Boyd left for the California goldfields and then returned to the Pacific, where he was killed in 1851 in what is now Solomon Islands.\nA number of areas are still named after Boyd. Sydney\u2019s Neutral Bay, a wealthy inner city suburb, has a road named Ben Boyd Road, while the Ben Boyd dam and Ben Boyd reservoir in the Bega Valley were named after him in 1997.\nIn his report, Dunn found Boyd\u2019s actions were the \u201cbeginnings of the idea\u201d of blackbirding, which was later taken up at far greater scale in Queensland after his death.\nThe decision to rename the park has been welcomed by local Indigenous communities.\nYvonne Weldon, chairwoman of the Metropolitan Local Aboriginal Land Council and the first Aboriginal candidate for lord mayor of the City of Sydney, said the questioning of public space names showed \u201cwe are moving forward as a society\u201d.\n\u201cWe must be secure enough in our identities to continue to talk about our public spaces,\u201d she said on Sunday.\n\u201cQuestioning who and what we remember, even when it throws up contradictions, is a sign that we are moving forward as a society and repairing relationships with our communities.\u201d\nWeldon said she had been campaigning to have Aboriginal leaders recognised across Sydney without success.\n\u201cThere are 25 publicly funded statues of the colony\u2019s early leaders around the CBD. Among them are Captain Cook, Governor Arthur Phillip, Lachlan Macquarie, Queen Victoria, explorer Matthew Flinders and even his cat Trim,\u201d she said. \u201cBut there isn\u2019t one that recognises Indigenous leaders.\u201d\nBJ Cruse, the chair of the Eden Local Aboriginal Land Council who campaigned for Ben Boyd national park to be renamed, told the Sydney Morning Herald: \u201cWe appreciate this special gesture of respect. We are keen to promote Indigenous heritage in the local area and the name change will go a long way to allow us to achieve that.\u201d",

The terms of reference for the review are comprehensive and wide-ranging.\u201d\nButtrose said the power to develop codes of practice for the ABC lay with the board, not the government, and that was a key pillar of the ABC\u2019s editorial independence.\nBragg announced the inquiry into the complaints handling arrangements of the ABC and SBS three weeks after the ABC established an external review and after he had been interviewed by reviewers about his concerns.\n\u201cInstead of respecting the integrity of this process, the Senate committee under the leadership of senator Bragg has decided to initiate a parallel process,\u201d Buttrose said.\n\u201cI will leave it to senator Bragg to explain his motives, but the impact of this action is clear. As chair of the ABC board I am duty-bound to call out any action that seeks to undermine the independence of the national broadcaster.\n\u201cA fundamental democratic principle underpinning the ABC has been its independence from interference by those motivated by political outcomes.\n\u201cPoliticians, like all citizens, are welcome to criticise anything they find wrong or objectionable that is published by the ABC, but they cannot be allowed to tell the ABC what it may or may not say.\n\u201cTransparency and accountability are important, and the Senate committee performs a vital role. The ABC attends Senate estimates hearings on multiple occasions every year and answers hundreds of questions on notice.\u201d\nIt is the second time in 12 months the ABC has accused the Morrison government of political interference.\nIn December 2020, Buttrose accused the government of a pattern of behaviour which \u201csmacks of political interference\u201d and earlier warned of an escalating campaign targeting the public broadcaster. She labelled claims it pushed agendas and campaigns against free enterprise as \u201cmalicious garbage\u201d.\nShe also threw her support behind a media freedom act and declared 2019\u2019s Australian federal police raids \u201cclearly designed to intimidate\u201d.\nButtrose accused the Morrison government of using News Corp Australia to attack its journalism last year after the Australian was briefed about a series of government questions for the broadcaster before the ABC received them.\nAfter Four Corners spoke to former Fox News insiders who claimed the right-wing channel became a propaganda outlet for the former president under the watch of Rupert Murdoch himself, News Corp went on the offensive, publishing 45 articles attacking the public broadcaster in two days.\n\u201cThe episode clearly violates the basic tenets of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation\u2019s published standards by exhibiting bias and a failure to maintain any level of impartiality in the presentation of news and information,\u201d a Fox News spokesperson said at the time.\nBragg told Sky News Australia the ABC complaints system was akin to a kid \u201cmarking their own homework\u201d.\n\u201cAt the moment if you lodge a complaint with the ABC it\u2019s not dealt with by an independent person,\u201d he said on Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like Dracula and the blood bank. They basically mark their own homework.\u201d\nBragg suggested a \u201clitany\u201d of people were unhappy with the ABC including veterans, multicultural communities and Jewish groups.\nBragg told Guardian Australia a parliamentary review was necessary because there had been \u201cextensive community concern over a number of programs and posts and the associated complaints handling\u201d.\nHe denied the ABC review was external even though the board appointed two independent experts to undertake it.\n\u201cIt is not an external review, it\u2019s an internal review and I believe the Senate inquiry will be a stronger mechanism,\u201d he said.",

        "content": "If Australia wants to stop being seen as a climate \u2018wrecker\u2019 it needs to increase its 2030 emissions target, phase down coal power and cut fossil fuel subsidies. Will it?\nThe Glasgow climate pact is not enough to solve the climate crisis but it includes steps that could help bridge the gap between rhetoric and action.\nWhat does it mean for Australia? Here are five key questions the Morrison government must now answer.\nInternational pressure on Australia to do much more \u201cthis critical decade\u201d \u2013 as the agreement calls it \u2013 is going to escalate next year.\nThis wasn\u2019t guaranteed. Under the landmark 2015 Paris agreement, countries were expected to submit new short term targets and plans to cut emissions only every five years. The next commitments were not expected until 2025.\nBut the Glasgow pact, agreed on Sunday morning Australian time, changes that. Countries \u2013 including Australia \u2013 agreed that existing 2030 goals fall far short of what is necessary and they should re-examine and strengthen them when they return to the negotiating table at Cop27 in Egypt.\nThere is wriggle-room in the language \u2013 it is a consensus-based international agreement, after all. The pact only \u201crequests\u201d that countries \u201crevisit and strengthen\u201d their 2030 targets to live up to the goals of the Paris agreement, and includes a caveat that those commitments should \u201ctake into account different national circumstances\u201d. Those circumstances are left open to interpretation.\nBut hiding behind nuance in wording will only get countries so far. For all the justified anger in Glasgow \u2013 about what Greta Thunberg calls the \u201cblah blah blah\u201d and the still-vast gap between what countries are doing and what is needed \u2013 the pact at least had an urgency in its language missing at other summits since Paris six years ago.\nIt backs the idea that much greater action is needed immediately to prevent what could be a catastrophic 2.4C heating above pre-industrial levels. For the first time, a global deal recognises the difference in damage between 1.5C and 2C of heating would be huge, and that staying at the lower level would require \u201crapid, deep and sustained\u201d cuts - a global 45% cut by 2030. Having been introduced into the pact, it is a benchmark against which countries will be measured.\nOn these terms, the Morrison government is clearly failing. Australia was the only major developed country that refused to increase its 2030 emissions reduction targets at Glasgow, rebuffing calls from allies in the US, UK, Europe and the Pacific.\nIn a statement issued shortly after the summit finished, ministers Marise Payne and Angus Taylor suggested the government did not plan to change that, describing Australia\u2019s 2030 target as \u201cfixed\u201d. They appeared to claim the government had already increased its commitments (known as nationally determined contributions, or NDCs) by including a net zero target for 2050 and official projections that suggested Australia would beat its 2030 target.\nThis argument might work politically at home, but experts say it is likely to be viewed as a joke \u2013 or worse \u2013 internationally. In the wake of Emmanuel Macron accusing Scott Morrison of lying, it will raise further questions about whether his government can be trusted internationally.\nNDCs were designed to capture short-term commitments so countries would put forward what they were doing and ramp it up over time. And a projection is obviously not a target or commitment.\nAlok Sharma, the Cop26 president and British cabinet minister, was asked at the summit\u2019s close what the consequences would be if Australia refused to come with a new 2030 target next year.\nHe said: \u201cThis is an international agreement and all countries will be judged by whether they stick to the commitments they\u2019ve made.\u201d\nFor the first time, countries have committed in a UN climate deal to \u201caccelerate efforts\u201d to stop using \u201cunabated coal power\u201d.\nThis might sound like an obvious thing \u2013 of course, dealing with the climate crisis mean an end for coal \u2013 but the inclusion of a specific commitment about the fossil fuel is an important step. While coal power started to be abandoned as a good investment over a decade ago, many observers assumed the reference would quickly be cut when it was proposed in the first draft of the pact on Wednesday.\nIt being there is a significant even though the wording was watered down at the last minute at the insistence of the Indian delegation, which demanded it be changed from a \u201cphase out\u201d to a \u201cphase down\u201d. The Australian delegation had already said it was comfortable with the words \u201cphase out\u201d before the change.\nTo put it mildly, this seems at odds with the Morrison government\u2019s position at home. Its policy is to acknowledge coal will go over the next few decades, but not to accelerate its exit. It has backed a policy that could pay to keep some plants running, and says Australia will continue to sell thermal coal overseas to anyone who wants to buy it.\nIt raises a couple of questions: how does the government define \u201cunabated\u201d and what will it now do to accelerate a phase down?\nThe pact also commits countries to accelerate the phase-out of \u201cinefficient\u201d fossil fuel subsidies.\nAnalyses have found Australian governments help fossil fuel industries with subsidies of more than $10bn each year. More than half that is through a fuel rebate for miners and farmers than use off-road diesel vehicles, which the government and Labor argue is not actually a subsidy.\nBut the government is also giving hundreds of millions of dollars to the gas industry to open up new basins and build power plants and other infrastructure. It is doing this despite the head of the International Energy Agency warning there should be no new oil or gas fields opened up if the world is to keep 1.5C alive. What gives?\nThis is related to the issue of targets, but a separate question in its own right. The global political focus has moved to keeping alive a chance of limiting heating to 1.5C.\nThe Morrison government has indicated through its policies that it doesn\u2019t actually support this goal, but has not explicitly said so.\nA few examples:\nSeveral sources told the Guardian the Australian delegation in Glasgow made clear it did not support the clause \u2013 considered necessary to keep 1.5C alive \u2013 that suggested 2030 targets should be increased next year. In the end, Australia and other countries accepted its inclusion rather than stand in the way of a deal\nThe government tried to block a recommendation at Unesco that countries should be aiming to limit heating to 1.5C to protect world heritage sites\nThe modelling report for the government\u2019s 2050 net zero plan makes no mention of considering a scenario in which the world acted in line with a 1.5C goal, referring instead to 2C\nThe government has been advised that its 2030 target \u2013 a 26-28% cut compared with 2005 \u2013 is not in line with what scientists say is necessary for Australia to play its part in staying within 2C, let alone 1.5C.\nThe scientific consensus says heating of 2C will lead to disasters several orders of magnitude worse than 1.5C, costing countless lives, cultures, species and ecosystems. It is the difference between some coral surviving on the Great Barrier Reef and its complete decline. Warming greater than 2C would be magnitudes worse again.\nThe Glasgow pact says wealthy countries are not paying what has been promised in climate finance, which is meant to help developing countries adapt and cut their own emissions. They had promised US$100bn from private and public sources by 2020 but didn\u2019t reach it. More will be expected over time.\nMuch less again has been contributed to \u201closs and damage\u201d, which is effectively compensation for the most vulnerable nations already facing unavoidable destruction from worsening extreme weather.\nIn his speech in Glasgow, Morrison announced $500m in new climate finance funding over five years, but offered nothing on loss and damage. It is one of the lowest contributions as a share of gross national income.\nAustralian is acting solo on finance, having pulled out of the green climate fund. A Greenpeace investigation suggested three-quarters of climate projects Australia funded directly in the Pacific had little or no link to climate change or the environment.",

There was no US ambassador in Paris for the French president, Emmanuel Macron, to deal with; like many world leaders, he does not engage with the charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires or other substitutes.\nThe depleted diplomatic corps is a symptom of Washington\u2019s polarized politics and evenly divided Senate. Two rightwing Republicans, Ted Cruz of Texas and Josh Hawley of Missouri, have been slowing down the process by objecting to the Senate moving forward via unanimous consent.\nCruz is taking a stand because he objects to a pipeline that will carry natural gas from Russia to Germany and wants the Biden administration to impose sanctions to stop it. His office told the Associated Press he was committed to using whatever leverage he has to force \u201cmandatory sanctions\u201d.\n  Hawley, for his part, has demanded that the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, resign because of the \u201cbotched Afghanistan withdrawal\u201d. He said: \u201cUntil there is accountability, the least we can do is actually vote for nominees to leadership positions at the state department and department of defense.\u201d\nWithout these holds the nominees could be confirmed through a voice vote, a process taking only minutes that can be used so long as no senators object. This is how more than 90% of nominees were confirmed at similar stages of the George W Bush and Obama presidencies.\nBut Cruz and Hawley are insisting on a more convoluted and time-consuming process in a Senate that already has an overwhelming to-do list. Democrats regard such tactics as playing politics with the national interest.\nJamie Raskin, a congressman from Maryland, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible impediment to our resuming democratic partnership and leadership in the world.\n\u201cThe rightwing plan has been to dismantle and disable democratic governance and leadership. They want to make the government dysfunctional so they can take it over and use it for their own purposes. We\u2019re just trying to defend the idea of the reality of democracy at this point.\u201d\nThere was finally some progress last month when the Senate confirmed, via voice vote, former senator Jeff Flake as ambassador to Turkey, Cindy McCain, wife of the late senator John McCain, as ambassador to the UN Agencies for Food and Agriculture, former senator Tom Udall as ambassador to New Zealand and Victoria Reggie Kennedy, widow of ex-senator Ted Kennedy, as ambassador to Austria.\nNotably all four had links to the Senate, a claim that not every nominee will be able to make. The snail\u2019s pace of confirmations has caused alarm at the American Foreign Service Association, which is the both the union and professional association of the US foreign service with 17,000 members in six agencies and departments.\nIts president, Eric Rubin, said: \u201cNo other country doesn\u2019t send ambassadors on a regular, timely basis, and no other country in history, including ours, has ever had this many vacant jobs for this long.\u201d\nRubin added: \u201cThe world is changing. It is by no means in a stable state and we have to work out and defend our role in this new world. The time has passed when the world is just going to tolerate our peculiarities. \u2018The US doesn\u2019t fill half its ambassadorships for a year? Oh, well, that\u2019s the US.\u2019\u201d",

But the rules requiring MPs to deposit the agreements with the office of the parliamentary commissioner for standards were scrapped by parliament in 2015.\nCampaigners are now calling for an urgent change in parliament\u2019s code of conduct to force disclosure of the work involved in MPs\u2019 advisory roles.\nBoris Johnson also faces calls for a review of MPs\u2019 outside interests and a ban on consultancies linked to politics after a public backlash over the extra earnings of many politicians.\nAn analysis of the MPs\u2019 register has revealed more than a quarter of Tory MPs have second jobs, worth more than \u00a34m a year. The interests they represent include the gambling industry, global investments firms and the energy sector.\nTom Brake, director of Unlock Democracy, a not-for-profit group which campaigns for democratic reforms, said new rules should be introduced urgently to require the publication of MPs\u2019 employment agreements linked to their political activity. He said: \u201cMPs should make this information available on a voluntary basis with immediate effect. It would help clear the air.\u201d\nUnder a previous guide to the code of conduct, published in 2012, MPs were required to deposit any employment agreement connected to their work as an MP for public inspection. A new code, approved by the House of Commons, in March 2015 removed the obligation.\nThe office of the parliamentary commissioner for standards said last week that no MPs had deposited contractual agreements in the last six years. One official said: \u201cThe only such agreements we still hold are historical ones dating from the period before the 2015 election, and none of them are live contracts as the employment has ended.\u201d\nThe row over the government U-turn on proposals to overhaul the House of Commons\u2019 disciplinary system has focused public attention on MPs\u2019 second jobs.\nFormer Conservative transport secretary Chris Grayling is one of the best-paid MPs, with a \u00a3100,000-a-year advisory role with Hutchison Ports Europe, which operates the ports of Felixstowe and Harwich and has its parent company in the Cayman Islands. He is paid about \u00a3270 an hour. Grayling was given the go-ahead for the role by the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments, but said he would not do work in areas where he may have \u201cgleaned specific information\u201d in his ministerial job.\nRishi Sunak, the chancellor, announced in March that Felixstowe and Harwich would be given freeport status, where normal tax and customs rules do not apply.\nFormer minister Andrew Percy, the Tory MP for Brigg and Goole, has disclosed in the MPs\u2019 register of interest a signing-on bonus of \u00a37,000 for the Canadian-based government relations firm Maple Leaf Strategies, which he worked for until last April. Percy also said he would receive commissions on any business referrals.\nPercy also discloses in the latest MPs\u2019 register that he has been paid \u00a3500 an hour for six hours\u2019 work a month for Iogen Corporation (Canada), a world leader in the development of cellulosic ethanol, a renewable transport fuel. Percy has previously campaigned in parliament for the national rollout of E10 fuel, which contains 10% ethanol. He has also been a member of the all-party parliamentary group for British Bioethanol. He did not respond to a request for comment on his outside interests last week.\nA report by the committee on standards in public life in July 2018 said the MPs\u2019 code of conduct and guide to the rules should be changed to read: \u201cMPs should not accept any paid work to provide services as a parliamentary strategist, adviser or consultant.\u201d The recommendation was not adopted by the Commons.\nSpeaking at an event at University College London last week, Lord Evans, chair of the committee on standards in public life, said the controversy over MPs\u2019 second jobs showed the public\u2019s concern on conduct in public office. He said: \u201cEthical standards are important for making democracy work. The public does care about this.\u201d",

        "content": "The ability to control our dreams is a skill that more of us are seeking to acquire for sheer pleasure. But if taken seriously, scientists believe it could unlock new secrets of the mind\nMichelle Carr is frequently plagued by tidal waves in her dreams. What should be a terrifying nightmare, however, can quickly turn into a whimsical adventure \u2013 thanks to her ability to control her dreams. She can transform herself into a dolphin and swim into the water. Once, she transformed the wave itself, turning it into a giant snail with a huge shell. \u201cIt came right up to me \u2013 it was a really beautiful moment.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a thriving online community of people who are now trying to learn how to lucid dream. (A single subreddit devoted to the phenomenon has more than 400,000 members.) Many are simply looking for entertainment. \u201cIt\u2019s just so exciting and unbelievable to be in a lucid dream and to witness your mind creating this completely vivid simulation,\u201d says Carr, who is a sleep researcher at the University of Rochester in New York state. Others hope that exercising skills in their dreams will increase their real-life abilities. \u201cA lot of elite athletes use lucid dreams to practise their sport.\u201d\nAnd there are more profound reasons to exploit this sleep state, besides personal improvement. By identifying the brain activity that gives rise to the heightened awareness and sense of agency in lucid dreams, neuroscientists and psychologists hope to answer fundamental questions about the nature of human consciousness, including our apparently unique capacity for self-awareness. \u201cMore and more researchers, from many different fields, have started to incorporate lucid dreams in their research,\u201d says Carr.\nThis interest in lucid dreaming has been growing in fits and starts for more than a century. Despite his fascination with the interaction between the conscious and subconscious minds, Sigmund Freud barely mentioned lucid dreams in his writings. Instead, it was an English aristocrat and writer, Mary Arnold-Forster, who provided one of the earliest and most detailed descriptions in the English language in her book Studies in Dreams.\nPublished in 1921, the book offered countless colourful escapades in the dreamscape, including charming descriptions of her attempts to fly. \u201cA slight paddling motion by my hands increases the pace of the flight and is used either to enable me to reach a greater height, or else for the purpose of steering, especially through any narrow place, such as through a doorway or window,\u201d she wrote.\nBased on her experiences, Arnold-Forster proposed that humans have a \u201cdual consciousness\u201d. One of these, the \u201cprimary self\u201d, allows us to analyse our circumstances and to apply logic to what we are experiencing \u2013 but it is typically inactive during sleep, leaving us with a dream consciousness that cannot reflect on its own state. In lucid dreams, however, the primary self \u201cwakes up\u201d, bringing with it \u201cmemories, knowledge of facts, and trains of reasoning\u201d, as well as the awareness that one is asleep.\nShe may have been on to something. Neuroscientists and psychologists today may balk at the term \u201cdual consciousness\u201d, but most would agree that lucid dreams involve an increased self-awareness and reflection, a greater sense of agency and volition, and an ability to think about the more distant past and future. These together mark a substantially different mental experience from the typically passive state of non-lucid dreams.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a grouping of higher-level features, which seem to be very closely associated with what we think of as human consciousness, which come back in that shift from a non-lucid to a lucid dream,\u201d says Dr Benjamin Baird, a research scientist at the Center for Sleep and Consciousness at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. \u201cAnd there\u2019s something to be learned in looking at that contrast.\u201d\nYou may wonder why we can\u2019t just scan the brains of fully awake subjects to identify the neural processes underlying this sophisticated mental state. But waking consciousness also involves many other phenomena, including sensory inputs from the outside world, that can make it hard to separate the different elements of the experience. When a sleeper enters a lucid dream, nothing has changed apart from the person\u2019s conscious state. As a result, studies of lucid dreams may provide an important point of comparison that could help to isolate the specific regions involved in heightened self-awareness and agency.\nUnfortunately, it has been very hard to get someone to lucid dream inside the noisy and constrained environment of an fMRI scanner. Nevertheless, a case study published in 2012 confirmed that it can be done. The participant, a frequent lucid dreamer, was asked to shift his gaze from left to right whenever he \u201cawoke\u201d in his dream \u2013 a dream motion that is also known to translate to real eye movements. This allowed the researchers to identify the moment at which he had achieved lucidity.\nThe brain scans revealed heightened activity in a group of regions, including the anterior prefrontal cortex, that are together known as the frontoparietal network. These areas are markedly less active during normal REM sleep, but they became much busier whenever the participant entered his lucid dream \u2013 suggesting that they are somehow involved in the heightened reflection and self-awareness that characterise the state.\nSeveral other strands of research all point in the same direction. Working with the famed consciousness researcher Giulio Tononi, Baird has recently examined the overall brain connectivity of people who experience more than three lucid dreams a week. In line with the findings of the case study, he found evidence of greater communication between the regions in the frontoparietal network \u2013 a difference that may have made it easier to gain the heightened self-awareness during sleep.\nFurther evidence comes from the alkaloid galantamine, which can be used to induce lucid dreams. In a recent study, Baird and colleagues asked people to sleep for a few hours before waking. The participants then took a small dose of the drug, or a placebo, before practising a few visualisation exercises that are also thought to modestly increase the chances of lucid dreaming. After about half an hour, they went back to sleep.\nThe results were striking. Just 14% of those taking a placebo managed to gain awareness of their dream state, compared with 27% taking a 4mg dose of galantamine, and 42% taking an 8mg dose. \u201cThe effect is humongous,\u201d says Baird.\nGalantamine has been approved by Nice to treat moderate Alzheimer\u2019s disease. It is thought to work by boosting concentrations of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine at our brain cell\u2019s synapses. Intriguingly, previous research had shown that this can raise signalling in the frontoparietal regions from a low baseline. This may have helped the dreaming participants to pass the threshold of neural activity that is necessary for heightened self-awareness. \u201cIt\u2019s yet another source of evidence for the involvement of these regions in lucid dreaming,\u201d says Baird, who now hopes to conduct more detailed fMRI studies to test the hypothesis.\nProf Daniel Erlacher, who researches lucid dreams at the University of Berne in Switzerland, welcomes the increased interest in the field. \u201cThere is more research funding now,\u201d he says, though he points out that some scientists are still sceptical of its worth.\nThat cynicism is a shame, since there could be important clinical applications of these findings. When people are unresponsive after brain injuries, it can be very difficult to establish their level of consciousness. If work on lucid dreams helps scientists to establish a neural signature of self-awareness, it might allow doctors to make more accurate diagnoses and prognoses for these patients and to determine how they might be experiencing the effects of their illness.\nAt the very least, Baird\u2019s research is sure to attract attention from the vast online community of wannabe lucid dreamers, who are seeking more reliable ways to experience the phenomenon. Galantamine, which can be extracted from snowdrops, is already available as an over-the-counter dietary supplement in the US, and its short-term side-effects are mild \u2013 so there are currently no legal barriers for Americans who wish to self-experiment. But Baird points out that there may be as-yet-unknown long-term consequences if it is used repeatedly to induce lucid dreams. \u201cMy advice would be to use your own discretion and to seek the guidance of a physician,\u201d he says.\nFor the time being, we may be safest using psychological strategies (see below). Even then, we should proceed with caution. Dr Nirit Soffer-Dudek, a psychologist at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Israel, points out that most attempts to induce lucid dreaming involve some kind of sleep disturbance \u2013 such as waking in the middle of the night to practise certain visualisations. \u201cWe know how important sleep is for your mental and physical health,\u201d she says. \u201cIt can even influence how quickly your wounds heal.\u201d Anything that regularly disrupts our normal sleep cycle could therefore have undesired results.\nMany techniques for lucid dream induction also involve \u201creality testing\u201d, in which you regularly question whether you are awake, in the hope that those thoughts will come to mind when you are actually dreaming. If it is done too often, this could be \u201ca bit disorienting\u201d, Soffer-Dudek suggests \u2013 leading you to feel \u201cunreal\u201d rather than fully present in the moment.\nAlong these lines, she has found that people who regularly try to induce lucid dreams are more likely to suffer from dissociation \u2013 the sense of being disconnected from one\u2019s thoughts, feelings and sense of identity. They were also more likely to show signs of schizotypy \u2013 a tendency for paranoid and magical thinking.\nSoffer-Dudek doubts that infrequent experiments will cause lasting harm, though. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s such a big deal if someone who is neurologically and psychologically healthy tries it out over a limited period,\u201d she says.\nPerhaps the consideration of these concerns is an inevitable consequence of the field\u2019s maturation. As for my own experiments, I am happy to watch the research progress from the sidelines. One hundred years after Mary Arnold-Forster\u2019s early investigations, the science of lucid dreaming may be finally coming of age.\nThere is little doubt that lucid dreaming can be learned. One of the best-known techniques is \u201creality testing\u201d, which involves asking yourself regularly during the day whether you are dreaming \u2013 with the hope that this will spill into your actual dreams.\nAnother is Mnemonic Induction of Lucid Dreaming (Mild). Every time you wake from a normal dream, you spend a bit of time identifying the so-called \u201cdream signs\u201d \u2013 anything that was bizarre or improbable and differed from normal life. As you then try to return to sleep, you visualise entering that dream and repeat to yourself the intention: \u201cNext time I\u2019m dreaming, I will remember to recognise that I\u2019m dreaming.\u201d Some studies suggest that it may be particularly effective if you set an alarm to wake up after a few hours of sleep and spend a whole hour practising Mild, before drifting off again. This is known as WBTB \u2013 Wake Back to Bed.\nThere is nothing particularly esoteric about these methods. \u201cIt\u2019s all about building a \u2018prospective\u2019 memory for the future \u2013 like remembering what you have to buy when you go shopping,\u201d says Prof Daniel Erlacher.\nTechnology may ease this process. Dr Michelle Carr recently asked participants to undergo a 20-minute training programme before they fell asleep. Each time they heard a certain tone or saw the flash of a red light, they were asked to turn their attention to their physical and mental state and to question whether anything was amiss that might suggest they were dreaming. Afterwards, they were given the chance to nap, as a headset measured their brain\u2019s activity. When it sensed that they had entered REM sleep, it produced the same cues as the training, which \u2013 Carr hoped \u2013 would be incorporated into their dreams and act as reminders to check their state of consciousness. It worked, with about 50% experiencing a lucid dream.\nSome commercial devices already purport to offer this kind of stimulation \u2013 though most have not been adequately tested for their efficacy. As the technology advances, however, easy dream control may come within anyone\u2019s reach.\nDavid Robson is a writer based in London.

        "content": "Companies offering remote monitoring software are booming. But spying on your employees is no way to treat people\nA year ago, while still in the grips of the pandemic, workers at many businesses \u2013 small and large \u2013 were continuing to work from home mostly due to either government or corporate mandates. Now, as the pandemic (hopefully) recedes, many workers are coming back to work but my smartest clients have learned that, to attract and retain the best people, a work-from-home option needs to be on the table.\nDuring the pandemic we were scrambling just to keep things going. But now we\u2019re implementing policies that many feel should have supervisory controls. And many business owners, large and small, are asking themselves a question: is it time to monitor what our people are actually doing when they\u2019re not working in the office?\nTo this I say: are you kidding me? Apparently not. In fact, a growing number of companies, as they\u2019re implementing new work-from-home benefits, are also incorporating remote monitoring software to keep an eye on their employees\u2019 behavior.\nA recent poll in the UK of more than 2,400 workers by the trade union Prospect found that almost one in three reported being monitored, up from a quarter of workers in April 2021. Not only that but the number of remote workers who said they\u2019ve been watched through an in-home camera has doubled during that period. Yes, you read that right: an in-home camera!\nHere in the US a study of 1,250 employers by Digital.com revealed that 60% were using monitoring software to track the productivity and activity of their work-from-home employees, citing reasons such as a \u201cbetter understanding how employees are spending time\u201d, \u201cconfirming workers are working a full day\u201d and \u201censuring they\u2019re not using work equipment for personal use\u201d.\nMeanwhile, demand for remote monitoring software is up more than 54% since the pandemic started, according to a site that tracks these things, and to meet that demand a proliferation of software companies have emerged offering work-from-home monitoring solutions.\nFor example, there\u2019s Aware, a platform that analyzes employee behavior across messaging platforms like Slack, which raised a $60m third round of financing last month. Microsoft announced just this week that it was adding increased employee surveillance so that its Microsoft 365 platform can use machine learning to track employee actions. Up-and-coming providers like Activtrak, Kickidler, Workpuls and iMonitorSoft position themselves as \u201cworkforce analytics\u201d platforms but are really just offering their corporate customers the capability of watching how their employees are using apps, the ability to take random screenshots triggered by an employee\u2019s suspicious behavior, and to see their workers\u2019 activities. Workpuls promises its customers that employees can be monitored \u201cwithout being noticed\u201d so that they can \u201cstill get the information you need\u201d.\nReally? After years of employees demanding more flexibility, independence and mobility are we as employers going to respond by tracking those employees\u2019 every movement while they\u2019re not in the office? This is the exact opposite of trust. There could not be a worse way to manage your teams. There does not exist a more inferior message to send to your people.\nThere are lots of advice columns \u2013 like this one \u2013 written to help employers get the most out of their employee monitoring software or to help them better track the activities of their employees working from home.\nWant my advice? Don\u2019t. Don\u2019t monitor your employees. Don\u2019t buy any of this software. Don\u2019t worry about what your employees are doing when they\u2019re not in the office. And for God\u2019s sake, don\u2019t install a camera in an employee\u2019s home!\nInstead, worry about how your business is achieving its objectives, how your employees are meeting their goals set out by their supervisors, whether or not they\u2019re doing this from home or from Mars. Who cares? Who cares what your employees are up to? Who has the time to waste monitoring this minutia? I couldn\u2019t even bear to spend an hour monitoring my kids\u2019 activities on Facebook without feeling my IQ drop, so now I\u2019m going to look over the shoulder of grown men and women hired to do a job for me as if they\u2019re in middle school?\nThis is not how you treat your people.

        "content": "Whatever the sobriety or otherwise of the three MPs in the news last week, a tipple or two at high altitude is a national institution\nLike every soldier, Ben Wallace knows that sometimes you have to fight fire with fire. As Owen Paterson\u2019s inferno of sleaze engulfed the Tories, the defence secretary lit a little tealight of his own. It was put about that a couple of SNP MPs, David Linden and Drew Hendry, and Labour MP Charlotte Nichols got pissed on a ministerial trip to Gibraltar. Like anyone who has been accused of being smashed on a flight, they deny the allegations. Wallace said the alleged conduct risked \u201cundermining respect for parliament\u201d.\nRubbish. The only lapse of judgment is Wallace\u2019s, in thinking anyone would care. If there is a cause that enjoys comprehensive cross-party, cross-demographic national support, it is drinking on the plane. Well, that and drinking at the airport. Not yet in the cab to the airport, although driverless cars may change that. But everyone knows that once you get through security, the complicated part of the trip is over.\nYou are in the hands of the authorities, and the chief authority in the departure lounge is JD Wetherspoon: the Beehive at Gatwick, the Windmill at Stansted: resonant names for the traveller.\nAny time of the day or night, you can guarantee that these bastions will be standing room only. It is a myth that airport drinking is the preserve of stags and hens. Young and old, rich and poor, men and women, champagne in the lounge, bloody mary after take-off, sundry tinnies: there\u2019s something for everyone. If it is good enough for Kate Moss, it\u2019s good enough for you.\nThe hierarchy of travel experiences is directly related to booze. At the bottom of the table are Ryanair and EasyJet, where you have to pay for your drinks on the plane, or beforehand \u2013 for the nervous \u2013 in the form of a reassuring voucher. Then there is British Airways and other normal carriers, where drinks are included in the price of a ticket, correctly understood to be a marker of high civilisation.\nIn business class, the free drinks start at the airport in a private lounge, for a better sort of alcoholic. After that, the drinks continue, relentlessly, until you land in a confusion of body and soul from which it takes the whole holiday to recover. One shudders to think what the situation is like on private jets. In fact, practically the only way to signify that you are very important is not to get battered on the plane. Nothing is more suspicious than a British person quietly going to sleep.\nWhere does it come from? Unlike other behaviours, which on closer examination turn out to be universal, getting flight-pissed does seem to be curiously British. The Danes and Germans enjoy a pint as much as the next northern European, yet their airport bars are not chocker with multigenerational legions of battered travellers. Well, sometimes they are, but only if they\u2019re Brits.\nThe British state of nature is to be drunk, which is why we invent little rules to convince ourselves otherwise, like waiting until the sun is \u201cover the yardarm\u201d \u2013 incidentally, an expression which most people take to mean some point in the afternoon but in fact refers to 11am.\nI suspect that modern travel drinking began with the defence of the realm act 1914. The regulations were designed to curb our natural instincts to help with the war effort. By limiting pub opening times and weakening drinks, the new wartime rules traumatised the population for many generations to come.\nIn the same way that displaced peoples favour art and jewellery \u2013 wealth they can take with them when they are next invaded \u2260 Brits know that the right to a pint might be seized at any moment, without warning.\nIn this light, drinking on a plane, where alcohol is freely available and you can be confident you won\u2019t have to drive for a couple of hours, becomes less of a happy luxury and more of a moral imperative. Enjoy this Carling now, child, it could be your last.\nSpeaking of defence of the realm, the best drink I\u2019ve ever had on a plane was a gin and tonic on an RAF flight, where guests are still trusted with heavy crystal tumblers and spirits are poured freely from large bottles.\nIf Ben Wallace is really worried about respect and parliament, perhaps he should start there.\nHe might also remember that another key part of the defence of the realm act was not spreading rumours about military matters.

        "content": "Patients \u2013 many of them housebound \u2013 have responded positively to an initiative that relieves pressure on family doctors\nAmbulance services are helping to relieve GPs\u2019 huge workloads by using some of their paramedics to carry out home visits to sick patients, a service traditionally undertaken by family doctors.\nParamedics are swapping answering 999 calls for tending people who have asked for a GP to see them at home because they are too ill or frail to come into the surgery.\nNHS bosses say paramedics taking on this role is fast emerging as a way of helping GPs, stopping patients ending up in hospital unnecessarily and tackling chronic understaffing.\nThe North East ambulance service (NEAS) is one of several services that is seconding paramedics to work with GPs because they believe that home visits help the NHS overall, including reducing pressure on A&E, which is experiencing record demand for care.\n\u201cIt helps GPs, patients like it and paramedics enjoy working like this,\u201d said Paul Younger, who has been with the NEAS since 2002 and is one of its six paramedics who work in primary care.\n\u201cIt takes about 45 minutes for a GP to go and see a patient for a home visit. But they can see four to five patients in their surgery in that time if a paramedic does the home visit instead.\n\u201cPlus, we paramedics can get there quicker, sometimes in as little as 15 minutes, whereas if a GP was going to visit someone at home who\u2019d rung the surgery that morning, they\u2019d have to wait until they\u2019d seen all their patients that morning and then go, so not until lunchtime.\u201d\nThree NEAS paramedics work like this every weekday around Berwick, and another three in North Tyneside, including Whitley Bay, North Seaton and Wallsend. They drive unmarked cars rather than NHS ambulances.\n\u201cInitially, some local GPs were a bit dubious. GPs have been doing primary care for decades so, with the change, some thought: do the paramedics know what they\u2019re doing? Are patients safe? But over time they\u2019ve learned that they can play an important part of looking after patients in primary care,\u201d added Younger.\nAlmost all the patients he and his colleagues visit are housebound. Most referrals have come from a GP but sometimes a district nurse, care home or domiciliary care worker makes the request. The NEAS paramedics also cover care homes \u2013 they comprise one in seven of their visits.\n\u201cThe range of clinical cases paramedics deal with is vast,\u201d said Paul Aitken-Fell, NEAS\u2019s lead consultant paramedic, who set up the service in 2019. The most common problem they encounter is trouble breathing, for example because of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. But they deal with a wide range of conditions including joint pain, skin problems, infections and heart attacks.\n\u201cIf you are having a heart attack you\u2019d be better off with a paramedic turning up at your house than a GP because, being specialists in urgent and emergency care, we see them more than GPs,\u201d added Younger. Only one in 10 patients ends up going to hospital because paramedics\u2019 experience means they can treat most of them on the spot and draw up a care plan, sometimes with input from a GP.\nNEAS is in talks with GPs elsewhere on its patch to start providing the service, including Hartlepool and Easington, said Aitken-Fell. NEAS\u2019s ability to deal with 999 calls is not undermined by the scheme because the six are dedicated home-visit paramedics, and deploying them like this should ultimately cut the number of people needing a blue light ambulance, he added.\n\u201cThis is a great example of different parts of the NHS coming together and working in new ways to deliver better care for patients,\u201d says Saffron Cordery, deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents England\u2019s NHS trusts, including the 10 specialist ambulance trusts. \u201cIt\u2019s a win-win-win: for the organisations involved, for staff and above all for patients, who feel listened to, safe and confident in the care provided.\u201d\nNHS Providers has highlighted NEAS\u2019s work with GPs in a report to be published this week on the creative solutions that trusts are adopting, given the health service in England is short of almost 100,000 staff.\nSeveral other ambulance services offer GP-style home visits. London ambulance service paramedics have undertaken home visits and worked in GP surgeries in the boroughs of Redbridge and Merton since last year.\nLAS is expanding its efforts to help hard-pressed GP surgeries. Thirty of its paramedics are currently on a training course, in conjunction with Health Education England, to enable them to work in GP surgeries alongside family doctors, practice nurses and their colleagues.\n\u201cArrangements like this are proving to be a virtuous circle where everybody benefits. We must expand these schemes to help keep primary care sustainable,\u201d said one NHS boss.",

        "content": "Last week, the companies responsible for polluting our waters were once again let off the hook by the government. But the fightback, from swimmers, surfers and environmentalists, is growing\nWhile the global leaders were in Glasgow at Cop26 last week, trying to agree forms of words to convince us they were serious about saving the planet, I was peering into a soupy brook that runs through protected wetland on the north Kent coast. In the past few months, the tidal brook at Long Rock beside the Swalecliffe wastewater treatment plant near Whitstable has become a potent symbol of the battle to enforce that most basic of environmental principles: don\u2019t dump raw human sewage into rivers and seas.\nI was standing beside the brook with Andy Taylor, a local musician and environmentalist. Most mornings for the past 15 years Taylor has monitored the big skies here for migrating birds that have decided to make a stopover \u2013 bramblings and fieldfares this morning \u2013 and also the quality of water in the brook. He points out to me the overflow pipes that sometimes feed untreated sewage directly into the stream. \u201cSome days you come down here and it\u2019s fine and you might even see kingfishers or water voles,\u201d he says. \u201cOther times it\u2019s just dead and stinking, this nasty coffee colour.\u201d\nTaylor has a file of pictures of eels, a protected species, floating lifeless on the surface of the water. \u201cThey have literally swum all the way from the Sargasso Sea to get here,\u201d he says. \u201cBut whatever goes in the water on that last 100 yards of their journey, they cannot survive.\u201d\nWhile we talk, we are joined by Jackie Kohler, who is walking her dogs and lives in one of a row of houses beside the brook at the entrance to the Swalecliffe plant. \u201cWhat happens is when it rains the tanks overflow, the brook overflows and all the sewage starts running down the road, with all sorts in it and collects by our cars,\u201d she says. \u201cThe kids have to use this bridge across the brook to get to school so residents have to come out and sweep it clean.\u201d\nThe brook merited a couple of paragraphs in the sentencing remarks of Mr Justice Johnson this July, in what was the most damning indictment of sewage management in this country since the Great Stink of 1858. The judge\u2019s report effectively documented a surreptitious great stink that Southern Water had perpetrated over a six-year period from January 2010 to December 2015. The water company, whose major shareholders were a consortium ofAmerican and Australian banks, pleaded guilty to 51 counts of discharging untreated sewage into controlled coastal waters at 17 separate sites (including most frequently from the overflow pipes immediately offshore at Swalecliffe). \u201cThe total period during which untreated sewage was discharged was 61,704 hours, or just over seven years,\u201d the judge noted. \u201cIt has been estimated that the total volume of untreated sewage across all of the sites was of 16-21bn litres or the equivalent of 7,400 Olympic-size swimming pools.\u201d\nIn fining Southern Water a record sum of \u00a390m for its systematic breaches, the judgment noted that \u201chistory shows that fines of hundreds of thousands or low millions of pounds have not had any effect on the defendant\u2019s offending behaviour\u201d.That criminality was emblematic of a nationwide scandal that means only 16% of English waterways are classified in good ecological health, and which places Britain 25th out of 30 EU countries for coastal water quality, with 200,000 outflows of raw sewage into bathing waters from Whitby to Penzance in May to September of this year alone.\nThe landmark ruling against Southern Water had several consequences. On a national level it focused attention on the ongoing scandal of so-called combined sewer overflows (CSOs) polluting rivers and seas. On a local level it prompted a wave of protest that has proved an object lesson in the capacity of community activism to shape the political agenda.\nThe start of that was a public meeting in Whitstable in August organised by the MP, Rosie Duffield, in which representatives of Southern Water were invited to address local concerns. Among those who came along to that meeting were five members of the Whitstable branch of the sea swimming group Bluetits. One of the leaders of this group, Sally Burtt-Jones, sitting sheltered from the biting North Sea wind in her beach hut at Tankerton, half a mile along the coast from Swalecliffe, explained to me what happened next.\n\u201cWe had prepared quite well for the meeting,\u201d Burtt-Jones says. She\u2019s the daughter of an accountant and she\u2019d gone through Southern Water\u2019s investor reports to find a structure that transferred profits between various businesses with a Cayman Island holding company. \u201cGiven that they were supposed to be taking care of local drainage and water needs, none of that felt quite right to me.\u201d\nThere was a widely held belief, supported by the July judgment, that Southern Water had been accepting fines \u2013 even the monster \u00a390m fine \u2013 as an anticipated cost, rather than addressing the problems that provoked them (the government claims, without showing its working, that the infrastructure work necessary to put an end to CSOs would potentially cost water companies and their bill payers \u201cbetween \u00a3350bn and \u00a3600bn\u201d; most observers put the cost closer to a tenth of that higher figure).\n\u201cSouthern Water sent two guys who were adamant they had been brought in to change things,\u201d Burtt-Jones says (one of them, Toby Willison, was until November 2020 chief operating officer of the Environment Agency, which had brought the legal case against the water company). \u201cThey were still trying to have a bit of a pity party for their shareholders who hadn\u2019t had any dividends since 2016,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI was like, \u2018How dare you? You\u2019ve got \u00a3340m in the bank.\u2019 They told me I didn\u2019t understand what I was talking about.\u201d\nThe Bluetits group left that meeting feeling there was no real commitment or genuine timeline from Southern Water to end CSOs; sitting in the pub they decided to set up a campaign, Save Our Seas, SOS Whitstable. They created a logo and put the notes from the meeting \u2013 inevitably headlined \u201ctits against shits\u201d \u2013 online. Within a few days, they had 2,000 supporters. That week, there was yet another mechanical failure at the Swalecliffe plant and with sewage being pumped out, the beaches along the coast were shut for four days right in the middle of August.\nThe media attention helped the SOS group to start a campaign that focused on an amendment to the environment bill in the House of Lords. The amendment, brought by the independent peer, the Duke of Wellington, would hold water companies legally accountable to reduce the amount of sewage they were putting in the sea.\n\u201cWe were hoping to get maybe nine or 10,000 people to sign a petition,\u201d Burtt-Jones says. \u201cBut then I bumped into someone at a party who knew Deborah Meaden and she tweeted it out.\u201d They got further momentum from hooking up with the longstanding pressure group Surfers Against Sewage.\nBy the time the 9th Duke of Wellington stood up to move his amendment, finding his own (overflowing) Waterloo, he could not resist \u201creferring to a petition which has been circulating in recent days which already has over 90,000 signatures on it calling on the government to support this amendment\u201d. Burtt-Jones shows me the footage of the debate on her phone. When the Green party peer Jenny Jones got up to praise the duke\u2019s PR machine, he denied all responsibility: \u201cFrankly I was as surprised as any of you that so many emails were sent out.\u201d\nThe Lords supported the amendment, but of course, the following week the government whipped backbenchers to vote it down, despite a great wave of anger partly directed by the SOS Whitstable group that had seen MPs\u2019 inboxes flooded with outrage about that decision.\nThe symbolism of that whipped vote was stark. The government\u2019s refusal to back the duke\u2019s amendment (on the grounds of the cost of investing in cleaner rivers and seas) exposed the flimsiness not only of their environmental commitment, but also of the loud election promises to rejuvenate Britain\u2019s coastal communities after Brexit: how can you rejuvenate seaside towns when the beaches are closed and people won\u2019t buy shellfish for fear of contamination? Some Tory MPs were affronted by the suggestion that in voting down greater legal powers against water companies they were voting \u201cto dump sewage in the seas\u201d. Their outrage ignored the fact that in the 30 years since privatisation successive governments had effectively encouraged utility companies to structure themselves as offshore debt instruments, beholden to shareholders not regulators. An investigation by the University of Greenwich, published in the Guardian, showed how since privatisation, \u00a357bn had been paid out by water companies in share dividends \u2013 just about the precise cost of the criminally overdue infrastructure improvements that would prevent the sewage outflows.\nThat impression of business as usual was compounded by the fact that in August it was announced that the Australian asset management group Macquarie had bought a controlling stake in Southern Water, promising \u00a32bn to \u201cstrengthen a zero-tolerance mindset to pollution\u201d. Those with not very long memories knew, following an in-depth BBC investigation, that in 2006, Macquarie had borrowed more than \u00a32.8bn to finance the purchase of Thames Water (later repaying \u00a32bn of the debt through new loans raised by a company subsidiary in Cayman Islands), effectively transferring the acquisition costs to Thames Water customers. In those 10 years, while Thames Water debt increased from \u00a34bn to \u00a310bn, share dividends averaged \u00a3270m per year. In 2015, when Thames announced a massive \u201csuper-sewer\u201d investment project to help alleviate sewage outflows, the entire cost of the project was to come from increased customer bills.\nOne other result of the national spotlight being shone on the Southern Water scandal was that for perhaps the first time since Brexit, here was an issue that cut across political tribes. Few places in this country were as divided about leaving Europe as the towns of the north Kent coast, but the SOS Whitstable campaign drew support from all quarters: trawlermen and surf schools and Airbnb owners; politicians of both right and left; remainers and Brexiters. Across all of those voters there is a growing campaign to withhold payment of Southern Water bills until action is taken.\nAt the sharpest end of that protest was the Whitstable Oyster Company, which in the past 30 years has become synonymous with the growth of the town as a tourist and foodie destination. The modern business (which originally dates back to the 1400s) was established by Barrie Green in 1978. It is now run by his sons: Richard, who looks after the restaurants, and James, who manages the oyster farming. I spoke to James in their Lobster Shack restaurant on the seafront last week. \u201cI used to say things couldn\u2019t get any worse,\u201d he told me, still just about retaining a smile, \u201cbut I stopped saying that a while ago. Covid we sort of dealt with, though the furlough scheme didn\u2019t help us because we still had to work on the farm. We were building up a stock of oysters, and the plan was to sell those to France as a bulk commodity. But that didn\u2019t happen, because in March, because of Brexit, that market was completely shut to us \u2013 despite the fact that Defra had assured us for three years that there would be a clause in the agreement that protected our trade. That was 50% of our business gone overnight.\u201d\nGreen looked in desperation for other markets. They started selling to Hong Kong and were doing OK up until the end of June. \u201cThen,\u201d he says, \u201cwe had a couple of cases of people who had eaten oysters coming down with norovirus, which is highly unusual in the summer.\u201d With the details of the prosecution against Southern Water in the news, Public Health England connected the two and shut down the oyster farm for a month initially at end of June, while Green put \u201cnew testing procedures in place including pre-harvesting assessments\u201d.\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t sell anything in July and August. We went from maybe \u00a3100,000 sales of oysters in June to nothing at all.\u201d\nGreen realises that talking about these issues is something of \u201ca double-edged sword\u201d for his business. \u201cThe fact is our oysters are safer now than they have ever been because we do so much testing and risk assessment,\u201d he says. \u201cBut we have to build confidence again.\u201d In Mr Johnson\u2019s remarks he noted that the Whitstable Oyster Company should think about bringing a civil case against Southern Water. \u201cWe would need a class action to do that,\u201d Green says. \u201cYou are taking on a $3bn company. They are not going to just roll over and give me \u00a3250,000 for loss of earnings \u2013 plus x for reputational damage \u2013 without a big fight.\u201d\nIt was the early warning system of oyster testing that first alerted the Environment Agency to the scale of the problems with Southern Water. The trigger was data from the Centre for Environment Fisheries and Aquaculture Science, which monitors the shellfish beds, whose classifications at Whitstable were declining. A similar picture was noted in the Solent, also part of Southern Water\u2019s geography. That prompted the national enforcement service to bring a comprehensive case against a water company for the first time in its history.\nOwen Bolton, the Environment Agency\u2019s senior crime officer, led that investigation. He explained to me on the phone the scale of the operation that was required, involving a team of 80, including 15 or 20 investigators in the field. \u201cWe collected 2 million lines of flow data,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd we also went into every Southern Water site to get site diaries, documents about incidents kept by the operator to hand over to the next shift, involving 27,000 entries.\u201d At every stage, the judge noted, Southern Water attempted to obstruct this disclosure process.\nAlan Cansdale, the Environment Agency\u2019s area manager, suggests that it was never straightforward for investigators on the ground to build a case. \u201cSometimes, as with the unfortunate events [when Prince Charles visited Whitstable] for the Queen\u2019s diamond jubilee weekend and there was a massive pollution incident with sewage debris all over the beaches, the issue is very obvious,\u201d he says. \u201cBut mostly you are looking for very subtle environmental indicators.\u201d In the end, he says, the investigation against Southern Water began with a very experienced investigator standing with him on a beach suggesting, \u201csomething here doesn\u2019t feel right at all\u201d.\nOne positive result of the July prosecution and fine is that Southern Water now reports CSOs from sites like Swalecliffe on an app almost in real time. The downside of that transparency is that it reveals just how often the discharges \u2013 which are supposed to be exceptional, storm-related events \u2013 take place.\n\u201cWe could cope if it was two or three times a year,\u201d James Green says, \u201cbut we have had months when there have been eight or nine CSOs. Each time, we don\u2019t harvest oysters for a couple of days afterwards, and then we make a risk assessment based on tides and weather conditions and then we test every single batch for E coli and norovirus until they are clean\u2026 It is shameful in my view that the government allows Southern Water to make large profits essentially at the expense of sustainable British companies like ours.\u201d\nIn its defence, Southern Water argues that the pressures on sites such as Swalecliffe, built in the 1960s when the population it served was less than half of the current 40,000, have increased, exacerbated by climate change. Owen Bolton suggests that during their investigation Southern Water was seen to \u201cbe investing many millions of pounds in improvements \u2013 though many of the infrastructure problems are not things the water companies can solve in six months\u201d.\nOfficials from the Environment Agency noted after the July verdict that the monitoring system can only work if there is a degree of trust in the operators: \u201cWe can\u2019t be sat on every outflow, we can\u2019t be monitoring every pipe.\u201d\nIn the absence of that trust, the system increasingly depends on community activists to hold the water monopolies to account. Rob Yates, a Labour councillor in nearby Thanet, is also a keen wild swimmer (\u201cI have swum from Alcatraz to San Francisco bay in a pair of Speedos,\u201d he told me). Increasingly, however, he thinks of himself as \u201ca citizen journalist\u201d. Since he moved to Margate he has been swimming in a tidal pool near to one of Southern Water\u2019s pumping stations. \u201cI\u2019ve seen panty liners and stuff in there a day or two after a release,\u201d he says. In recent months Yates has been doing painstaking work, using Freedom of Information requests to try to see exactly how often the water company breaches the terms of its permit.\n\u201cThe Environment Agency have had their funding cut by two-thirds since 2010,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re obviously going to focus on the big incidents, but if ordinary citizens started doing FoI requests you can begin to find out how many non-compliant incidents there have been and build a picture.\u201d\nOne of the consequences of that monitoring is that Yates is among the first to see the EA\u2019s testing results. On the day we speak he has seen a reading for E coli that is \u201cvery, very high\u201d. \u201cNow the problem for me is, I know that test was done probably five days ago, and it\u2019s taken three days to get test results. So how do I know whether the water is safe now?\u201d\nThe morning after I met Sally Burtt-Jones, the wind had stopped blowing quite so fiercely and perhaps 40 of the Whitstable Bluetits had gathered on the shingle in the weak morning sunshine outside Tankerton\u2019s Marine Hotel, stripping down to swimming costumes (and bobble hats and gloves) to plunge into the frigid tidal waters. You might think of them as a small army of very British Erin Brockoviches, increasingly expert in the nuances of sewer management and corporate responsibility.\nThey include Dodda John-Baptist, 58, a recently retired headteacher, who moved down to Whitstable last year specifically so she could swim every day to ease her osteoarthritis. And Catherine Chapman and Jayne McClelland, who set the group up after the first lockdown as a way of rebuilding community. Watching the Bluetits plunge screaming into the sea, it\u2019s impossible not to admire their collective will; afterwards, shivering on the shingle, several tell me that if it wasn\u2019t for the group spirit they would not have had the courage either to swim or to stand up and be counted in the battle for cleaner seas and rivers.\nWhile she gets dried I chat to Jane Dean, a retired police officer who has come down from Faversham. \u201cI\u2019ve never taken drugs and I don\u2019t drink,\u201d she says \u201cbut I can\u2019t imagine the elation you get from any of that matches this. It lasts for hours after you come out. My friend said, \u2018I bet people walk past and think: look at all those funny fat old ladies in the sea\u2019. Actually, I said, they are thinking: \u2018I wish I had the balls to do that.\u2019\u201d\nDean turned 60 was last week. She got her pension on Monday and spent the lump sum on Tuesday, buying a motorhome in which she and her swimming pal plan to tour the coast around to Devon, \u201ctits on tour\u201d, sewage permitting. \u201cSometimes swimming is the thing you look forward to all week,\u201d she says, \u201cand then you come down here and find the sea\u2019s full of shit again and you can\u2019t go in and your heart just sinks. These days it seems to happen every time it rains\u2026\u201d\nWe turn to the \u00a390m question of how you make monopoly water operators invest in infrastructure. The consensus is that the directors of these companies need to be held to account in some way for the environmental crimes that occur on their watch. (Southern Water\u2019s CEO during the period for which it was prosecuted, Matthew Wright, announced himself \u201cas shocked as anyone\u201d by the judge\u2019s findings. He left his \u00a3700,000 a year job in 2017 and became UK managing director of the \u00a33bn Danish energy firm \u00d8rsted.)\nI asked Anne Brosnan, the chief prosecutor for the EA in the Southern Water case, if the agency had considered bringing charges against directors as well as the company itself?\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have prosecuted individual directors in the past and we will do so in the future. We are now looking at that possibility more closely than ever. But we obviously always have to follow the evidence.\u201d\nLast Monday, as MPs were finally voting not to include the duke\u2019s amendment in their environment bill, Southern Water invited a group of local residents \u2013 including Sally Burtt-Jones, Andy Taylor and Jackie Kohler \u2013 to tour its Swalecliffe site and hear about improvements that were planned. While they were being shown pristine overflow tanks and being told that the pipes into the brook would be capped in the next fortnight, MPs were announcing their partial U-turn on the duke\u2019s amendment, which proposed \u201ca duty of progressive reduction\u201d on sewage dumping. Among those criticising the diluted legislation was former Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron. \u201cThere are no targets in terms of volume or in terms of timescale, which leaves water companies with the power to continue what they do now.\u201d\nIn the course of her tour at Swalecliffe, Burtt-Jones asked the Southern Water representative if at the very least the company would agree to pay for technology that could monitor sea water safety in real time. \u201cThe bloke behaved as if that idea had never occurred to him,\u201d she says. There is no doubt a hope from the government that the stink surrounding this issue will fade. I wouldn\u2019t be so sure. Having finally found an issue on which all of the country can agree, groups such as the Whitstable Bluetits \u2013 not to mention the hundreds of thousands of people who support Surfers Against Sewage and other local protests forming up and down the country \u2013 are not going anywhere. \u201cThe thing is,\u201d Burtt-Jones says, \u201cthis is such a simple issue for anyone to understand. Even very small children get it: when they go to the beach, they don\u2019t want to find that the sea is full of poo.\u201d",

Western nations have accused Belarus of attracting people wanting to come to the EU to the border, while Poland has been rebuffing their efforts to enter.\nThe former MI6 officer Christopher Steele has said he believes Moscow thinks it is at war with the UK and its allies.\nAsked about this view on Sky News\u2019s Trevor Phillips on Sunday, Carter said: \u201cRussia probably regards the global strategic context as a continuous struggle in which, I think, they would apply all the instruments of national power to achieve their objectives. But in so doing, [the Russians] don\u2019t want to bring on a hot war.\n\u201cSo, yes, in a way I think he\u2019s right. The question, of course, is how you define war and I, as a soldier, would tend to define war as the actual act of combat and fighting, and I don\u2019t think they want that.\n\u201cI think they want to try and achieve their objective in rather more nuanced ways.\u201d\nHe later told BBC One\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show that Russia was in a \u201chybrid playbook where you link disinformation to destabilisation and the idea of pushing migrants on to the European Union\u2019s borders is a classic example of that sort of thing\u201d.\nHe said it was most likely that the Belarus and Ukraine border situations were \u201cclassic distraction\u201d by the Russian government of the type that had been going on \u201cfor years and years and years\u201d.\nAsked whether it could turn into a shooting war, Carter said: \u201cI don\u2019t know. I think we have to be on our guard and make sure deterrence prevails and critically we have to make sure there is unity in the Nato alliance and we don\u2019t allow any gaps to occur in our collective position.\u201d\nCarter also acknowledged that the situation in Afghanistan was \u201cnot good\u201d, after arguing at the time of the Taliban takeover in August that the group had changed and should be \u201cgiven space\u201d to form a government.\nHe said there had been \u201cghastly images \u2026 of a potential humanitarian crisis\u201d and admitted the Taliban had \u201ca lot of things that had got to change\u201d. But he still insisted the Taliban were different from how they were in 2001 and claimed \u201cthe moderate lot are probably privately arguing to be a different sort of Taliban\u201d.\nAdm Sir Tony Radakin, 55, the head of the navy, is taking over as head of the armed forces, with Carter due to stand down at the end of the month.",

        "content": "With an experienced yet still youthful core, a likely away tie in the World Cup play-offs to reach Qatar is to be embraced\nWith appropriate level of apology to the good people of Norway, a Saturday evening scoreless draw with Latvia raised smiles in Scotland. As the Tartan Army glance towards March and World Cup play-offs \u2013 three teams from 12 will advance to Qatar \u2013 it is hardly being disrespectful to suggest the prospect of Grant Hanley squaring up to Erling Haaland is far from appealing.\nWith the World Cup as a prize, Denmark\u2019s Christian Eriksen dismantled the Republic of Ireland in 2017. Haaland would surely place similar stock in an appearance on international football\u2019s greatest stage. Instead, barring a Turkey stumble in Montenegro on Tuesday, Scotland will be spared one of the most feared forwards in Europe.\nThe Norway scenario is significant because it is the latest example of football\u2019s great unmeasurable in relation to Scotland. Things seem to be falling perfectly for Steve Clarke. Scotland\u2019s manager will rightly raise an eyebrow at any sense of good fortune consistently favouring his team \u2013 Clarke\u2019s performance has in itself been fantastic \u2013 but it is no affront to point out that the best in this particular business carry a level of luck.\nProgression to Euro 2020 was via a penalty shootout. The key Scottish moment in this World Cup campaign was a 94th-minute Scott McTominay winner against Israel. Lyndon Dykes nudged the Scots past the Faroe Islands with just four minutes to spare.\nThe point here is not that Scotland should thank the football gods that they are heading to a play-off. Indeed, they are seven points clear of third-place Israel in Group F with one game to spare. Rather, there should be legitimate celebration of this achievement when Denmark visit Hampden Park on Monday.\nScotland spent so many years as an international irrelevance, whereby breaks never fell their way and supporters grew disillusioned in their thousands, that they must embrace these heady days while they last. Just four years ago a Scotland manager in the shape of Gordon Strachan was reduced to blaming genetics as yet another qualifying bid crashed and burned. Try telling that to 5ft 7in Billy Gilmour in 2021.\n1. There are three qualifying spots at Qatar 2022, to be played for by 12 teams: 10 group runners-up plus the two highest ranked winners of Nations League groups that have not qualified otherwise. Portugal, Italy, Poland, Scotland, Russia, Sweden and North Macedonia have qualified as runners-up.\u00a0\nEither Wales or the Czech Republic will be runners-up in Group E, but whoever is not will get a spot via the Nations League route. Austria are guaranteed a spot via the Nations League route.\u00a0\n2. The six group runners-up with the best records, excluding games against the bottom side in six-team groups, will be seeded.\u00a0\nPortugal, Scotland, Italy and Russia will be seeded. Wales, who need to draw with Belgium to be sure of being runners-up, would be seeded if they were to win, though a draw would suffice unless Turkey win by four goals in Montenegro, or Turkey win by three and Norway beat the Netherlands by four.\n3. The seeded teams will play at home in the one-off play-off semi-finals, on 24-25 March. The draw on 26 November will determine which semi-finals will provide the home team in the one-off finals, on 28-29 March.\nThe present incumbent has long since earned the right to speak and behave as he pleases. Clarke broke the mould by taking Scotland to a major finals for the first time since 1998. Professional responsibility means it would be folly for the 58-year-old to publicly disregard the Denmark clash. Yet it has been more than a little dispiriting to listen to sudden Scottish focus on whether a seeding, and home advantage, can be gleaned by virtue of at least a point from their closing group fixture.\nHampden should stage a party, an appreciation of this team\u2019s sterling efforts in finishing higher than their pot status, rather than provide an environment whereby people are stuck in front of phone screens, calculating play-off permutations.\nThere is already a prevailing sense that not claiming a seeding spot would somehow represent disappointment, which is preposterous given where Scotland have emerged from. If not seeded \u2013 and this is a moveable feast \u2013 as things stand, Scotland could travel to face Wales, Poland, Croatia, Sweden, Switzerland or Serbia.\nTurkey, Finland and Macedonia join the Scots in the unseeded bracket for now, with Austria and the Czech Republic making up the numbers through the Nations League. Of course, the case can readily be made that Clarke would rather avoid a trip to any of the initial sextet but the task would hardly be insurmountable. In many respects, the set-up of Clarke\u2019s team suits one-off away ties. In Glasgow, pressure and expectation fall on Scotland.\nThe key attribute of this Scotland squad is its experience amid youthfulness. John McGinn has amassed 41 caps at the age of 27; Callum McGregor has 40 at 28, McTominay 28 at 24; Kieran Tierney and Andy Robertson, 24 and 27 respectively, have played 29 and 54 times for their country. Gilmour has become a first pick at 20, with Nathan Patterson on the verge of the same standing at the same age. The best international teams grow with a solid core.\nClarke\u2019s key Denmark dilemma relates to his batch of players who would incur a suspension for the play-off semi-final if booked. McTominay, who is among them, will definitely not feature after failure to recover from a throat infection. A clearly unfair rule states the two caution limit must carry forward, even from groups including more matches than others.\nNonetheless, Scotland are not the only team with this issue. There is also no reason that Denmark will be especially feisty opposition. The colour, the noise, the vibrancy should come from the stands. For a watching generation, these are the very best of times.",

It will be a deterrent to all sorts of things that we espouse and we must get to the bottom of it.\u201d\nWanjiru was last seen one evening in March 2012 with a British soldier from the military base, and her body was found about two months later.\nRose Wanyua, Wanjiru\u2019s eldest sister, told the Guardian: \u201cIt\u2019s painful, very painful. Shiru did not deserve to die the way she did. We will never forget her.\u201d\n  Wanyua disputes the assumption that her sister met the soldiers while looking for clients as a sex worker. \u201cA friend told my sister that there was some \u2018quick money\u2019 to be made that evening if only Wanjiru joined her in entertaining the Johnnies in town. She was a hair stylist who used to make my daughters\u2019 hair, never the prostitute as many would like the world to believe,\u201d she said.\nThe defence secretary, Ben Wallace, told parliament\u2019s in-house magazine, The House, that people had turned a blind eye to the culture of British soldiers using sex workers.\n\u201cWe should be asking ourselves what our soldiers are doing to respect women? Let\u2019s start with that,\u201d he said. \u201cHave we done too much turning a blind eye over the last 30 years about prostitution?\u201d\nAsked if people had turned a blind eye, he replied: \u201cWe have done, certainly in countries in poverty, where the British are there on a whole range of issues.\u201d\nWallace said of the Wanjiru case: \u201cIt\u2019s a deeply concerning murder and story and there is no one in the MoD standing in the way of [an investigation]. There\u2019s no cover-up, there\u2019s no blockade.\u201d\nThe UK high commissioner to Kenya, Jane Marriott, last month expressed \u201coutrage and concern\u201d over Wanjiru\u2019s death and promised high-level support for a Kenyan investigation into her murder.",

One would run between Leeds and Sheffield and another from Birmingham to East Midlands Parkway, which is in the Conservative constituency of Rushcliffe, 10 miles south of Nottingham. There would apparently be a puzzling non high-speed gap of 50 miles between the two new lines.\nAccording to the Mail on Sunday, Leeds will receive its own tram system \u201cin consolation\u201d for not being connected to HS2.\nThe director of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership thinktank, Henri Murison, said: \u201cWithout the benefits to areas such as Yorkshire and the north-east, HS2\u2019s status as a project to drive the whole of the UK is undermined considerably.\n\u201cWill this be a government that levels up, or levels down and walks away from the northern powerhouse they promised with city leaders across the north?\u201d\nBehind the scenes in the northern mayoralties, there are also major jitters about Northern Powerhouse Rail (NPR), a new trans-Pennine railway line from Liverpool to Leeds via Bradford.\nDetails about the line were conspicuously absent from Sunday\u2019s newspaper leaks, though building it was one of Boris Johnson\u2019s first pledges as prime minister. Three days into the job in 2019, he gave a speech at Manchester\u2019s Science and Industry Museum, saying: \u201cI want to be the prime minister who does with Northern Powerhouse Rail what we did for Crossrail in London.\u201d\nHe committed in February 2020 to bringing HS2 to the north of England, building \u201ca rapid connection from the West Midlands to the northern powerhouse, to Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds\u201d.\nCrossrail is a new \u00a318.6bn east-west rail line in London. It is currently three years behind schedule and \u00a33.8bn over budget, but seen as a key driver of economic growth in the capital.\nNPR is the brainchild of Transport for the North (TfN) , a statutory body set up to advise ministers on the region\u2019s transport needs. It says NPR would reduce road usage by 58,000 car trips per day, and create 100,000 jobs in the urban north.\nTfN has been adamant the line should include a new through-station in Bradford, which was named last week as Britain\u2019s worst-connected major city.\nThe Mail on Sunday said other announcements expected this week included the \u00a378m electrification of the line from Wigan to Bolton, which now has two Tory MPs, and a reinstatement of a passenger service from Sheffield to Stocksbridge, which in 2019 elected its first Tory MP since 1935.\nMurison said the government\u2019s priority should be to build HS2 south from Leeds \u201cas well as securing a new station in Bradford on the critical new line across the Pennines\u201d.\nThe Guardian asked TfN what the point of its existence was, if the government ignored its key recommendations.\nIts chief executive, Martin Tugwell, said it would be premature to comment before Thursday.\n\u201cWhat does remain clear though, is our commitment to securing the best possible rail connectivity for the 15.2 million people of the North, and fundamental to that connectivity is the work we have done to date on Northern Powerhouse Rail as a co-client with government and the way it integrates with the rest of the rail network, including with HS2,\u201d he said.\nA Department for Transport spokesperson said: \u201cWork is continuing on the integrated rail plan. We will publish it shortly and do not comment on speculation.\u201d",

The home secretary has maintained that the tactic of intercepting and sending back boats to France would be within the law.\nDocuments from the Home Office seen by the Guardian show that the government\u2019s own lawyers have warned ministers that the tactic could lead to a legal challenge from a union or possible strike action.\nIt emerged last week that counsel warned the home secretary that the odds of successfully defending a challenge are \u201cless than 30%\u201d.\nThe number of asylum seekers crossing the English Channel hit a new daily record of 1,185 on Thursday.\nThree people were feared lost at sea after two kayaks were found adrift off the coast of Calais on Thursday. There has been a spate of recent deaths and disappearances of those people trying to reach the UK across the Channel.\nKevin Mills, the PCS lead for Border Force, said: \u201cWe have examined the possibility of launching a judicial review. PCS is in consultation with its members and a number have raised direct concerns about the pushback tactic \u2013 the safety and if it is legal.\n\u201cIf someone dies, it won\u2019t be Priti Patel taking the body out of the water. And to say that the officers concerned won\u2019t be prosecuted does not help our members\u2019 mental health,\u201d he told the Guardian.\nA document circulated within the Home Office in September outlined government lawyers\u2019 concerns that unions could launch a successful challenge if ministers go ahead with \u201cpushback\u201d plans.\n\u201cWe have commenced the required three weeks of formal consultation with the three relevant Home Office trade unions on the operational proposals,\u201d the document said.\n\u201cWhile consultation requires listening, responding and, where possible, reaching mutual agreement in basic terms we can ultimately proceed without trades union agreement,\u201d the document said.\nThe document warned that unions could take industrial action, apply for a judicial review or use the Employment Rights Act to challenge the tactic.\n\u201cHowever, there are the potential risks of the trades unions taking strike action or action short of a strike following a ballot and they could also be the source of a legal challenge. They may apply for a judicial review and support individual claims \u2013 including under section 44 of Employment Rights Act,\u201d it said.\nEnver Solomon, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, said: \u201cThe union is right to challenge pushbacks as cruel, dangerous and in conflict with international law. Conservative prime ministers since Winston Churchill have welcomed people, regardless of how they have reached our shores, who through no fault of their own have had to flee for their lives.\u201d\nPatel is under increasing pressure from Boris Johnson and Conservative MPs to cut the numbers making the crossing. The home secretary promised to make the route \u201cunviable\u201d in August 2020.\nThe Guardian first heard of the plans to push back boats in the Channel from Conservative MPs who had meetings with Patel in early September following a surge of crossings.\nDays later, the Home Office announced that they aimed to turn around boats, despite warnings from the French authorities, unions and refugee charities that it could endanger lives.\nHome Office sources insisted that Border Force guards were being trained to employ the tactic in specific circumstances, but union officials warned that they could envisage few circumstances where it would be viable.\nLucy Moreton, from the Immigration Services Union that also represents Border Force guards, said the plan would never work because France would not engage with it. \u201cThis announcement makes it more likely that some could jump into the sea when they are approached to ensure their boat is not turned back,\u201d she said.\nAt the Conservative party conference in October Patel said she would move forward on the plan to turn back boats after consulting the prime minister.\n\u201cBoris [Johnson] and I have worked intensively with every institution with a responsibility to protect our borders. Border Force, the police, the National Crime Agency, maritime experts \u2013 and yes, the military \u2013 to deliver operational solutions, including new sea tactics, which we are working to implement to turn back the boats,\u201d she said.\nPatel also appeared before the House of Lords in October, and insisted that the practice of sending boats back to France would be within the law. Asked by Baroness Shami Chakrabarti if she had received legal advice regarding the pushback of boats. Patel replied: \u201cThere is a legal basis for it.\u201d\nThe Home Office said it does not comment on leaks or legal advice. Dan O\u2019Mahoney, the \u201cclandestine Channel threat commander\u201d, said: \u201cMigrants making these dangerous crossings are putting their lives at risk and it is vital we do everything we can to prevent them and break the business model of the criminal gangs exploiting people.\n\u201cAs part of our response it is important we have a maritime deterrent in the Channel, and Border Force officers are authorised, trained and stand ready to use safe and legal options to stop these deadly crossings.\u201d",

It has a stake in Somerset Capital Management, an investment company, the parent firm of Somerset Capital Management (Cayman) in the Cayman Islands.\nAccounts for Saliston show the \u00a36m in loans \u2013 \u00a32.94m in 2018, \u00a32.3m the following year and \u00a3701,513 in 2019-2020 \u2013 attracted interest paid at the equivalent of about 0.8%, which is below market rates. The accounts list the loan as attracting interest rates of 2.5% and 3.5% in individual years, raising the prospect that he could have borrowed the money and repaid it over short periods of time.\nThe MPs\u2019 code of conduct does not specifically cover directors\u2019 loans but it states: \u201cMembers shall fulfil conscientiously the requirements of the house in respect of the registration of interests in the register of members\u2019 financial interests. They shall always be open and frank in drawing attention to any relevant interest in any proceeding of the house or its committees, and in any communications with ministers, members, public officials or public office holders.\u201d\nLabour\u2019s Thangam Debbonaire, the shadow leader of the Commons, said: \u201cThis would appear to be yet another egregious breach of the rules. A cabinet minister failing to declare millions of pounds of additional income is unacceptable.\n\u201cThe parliamentary commissioner for standards must investigate this. Jacob Rees-Mogg must come clean about all of his financial interests outside of parliament.\u201d\nA spokesperson for Rees-Mogg said he stood by his statement that it had been properly declared, after the Mail on Sunday reported the story. Rees-Mogg said: \u201cSaliston is 100% owned by me. This is declared clearly in the Commons register and to the Cabinet Office.\n\u201cIt has no activities that interact with government policy. The loans from 2018 were primarily taken out for the purchase and refurbishment of [my home] as temporary cashflow measures. All loans have either been repaid with interest in accordance with HMRC rules or paid as dividends and taxed accordingly.\n\u201cI have no managerial responsibility for Somerset Capital Management. However, I know that the Cayman company purely provides a fund for non-UK investors but any and all money it makes returns to Somerset Capital Management in the UK where it pays full UK taxes.\u201d\nMeanwhile, one of Rees-Mogg\u2019s Conservative colleagues came under scrutiny over lobbying. The Sunday Times reported that a unit in the Department for Transport (DfT) set up by Grant Shapps, a private aviation enthusiast, had been lobbying against housebuilding on small runways.\nThe DfT said the team was not a lobbying body and instead provided \u201csupport to general aviation on a range of matters affecting their operations\u201d.",

        "content": "Exhibit the same lack of control and Australia will finish the tour wearing a triple crown backwards on an uneasy head\nThe Wallabies face the ignominy of losing all of their Tests on a spring tour of Europe for the first time in the professional era if they do not address the ill-discipline which contributed so heavily to their defeats to Scotland and England.\nAfter a caning from French referee Romain Poite in their 15-13 loss to Scotland at Murrayfield two weeks ago, Australia were penalised 18 to nine by South African referee Jaco Peyper in their 32-15 loss to England at Twickenham on Sunday morning.\nCompounding the problem was the fact the Wallabies played with 14 men for 20 minutes against England after winger Tom Wright (high tackle) and loose-head prop Angus Bell (tip tackle) were yellow-carded.\nExhibit the same lack of control against Six Nations champions Wales in Cardiff on Sunday (Australian time), they will finish the tour wearing a triple crown backwards on an uneasy head.\nThe Wallabies, despite fighting bravely and somehow remaining in the contest for most of the match, never really looked like winning.\nThe lopsided penalty count informed almost every aspect of the game, with England dominating the attacking statistics.\nEngland kicked the ball 31 times to the Wallabies\u2019 23 and also enjoyed 60% possession as well as 62% of the territory.\nThe English carried the ball 82 times to Australia\u2019s 55 and maked 333 run metres to their 256. They made five clean breaks to three, beat 18 defenders to 14 and delivered nine offloads to three.\nIn virtually every attacking area of the game, Dave Rennie\u2019s side \u2013 outscored two tries to nil \u2013 came off second best, and it mostly stemmed from the penalty count.\nRennie should invite an ex-international referee to training this week to observe the players and help correct any bad behaviour for, if such behaviour remains, they will almost certainly suffer the same fate against the Welsh.\nBut it was not just penalties to blame; the inaccuracy of their play in general is a recurring problem. Apart from some broken field running, the Wallabies did not threaten the English defence and lacked cohesion in the backs.\nComparing the two backlines, there was a stark contrast in terms of capabilities. While England had two playmakers \u2013 rookie five-eighth Marcus Smith and inside-centre Owen Farrell \u2013 the Wallabies had only one, No 10 James O\u2019Connor, although they could have used fullback Kurtley Beale as a second ball distributor.\nEngland\u2019s dual playmakers enabled them to shift the ball wide. This was evident in fullback Freddie Steward\u2019s try in the sixth minute when Farrell and Smith combined to put him through a gap.\nWhen England wanted to get across the advantage line from the set pieces they brought giant winger Manu Tuilagi into the midfield to crash the ball up.\nThe Wallabies should consider playing Beale at inside-centre to give them two playmakers or start rookie five-eighth Noah Lolesio and shift O\u2019Connor to No 12, which is his preferred position.\nWithout Samu Kerevi they do not have any Tuilagi-sized backs to get across the advantage line so should look at using a running forward in the mid-field, especially from the lineout, to play a similar role.\nWith tight-head props Allan Alaalatoa and Taniela Tupou unavailable because of concussion, most observers expected England to monster the Wallabies scrum, but the Australians gained parity in the set piece against an English pack that had its own injury woes up front.\nThe Wallabies may not be so fortunate against Wales, and would do well to start France-based second-rowers Rory Arnold and Will Skelton together to see what they can do as a locking combination rather than bring Skelton off the bench for Arnold.\nIf halfback Nic White had not dislodged the ball from hooker Jamie George\u2019s grasp as he was falling over the try line in Australian captain Michael Hooper\u2019s tackle in the 34th minute, England would have led 23-9 at half-time, instead of 16-12, and the game would have been all but over.\nThe most remarkable thing about the Wallabies\u2019 performance was that they stayed in the game almost right up to the end by virtue of their courage and enthusiasm, especially in their line-speed in defence.\nThat, and their huge effort chasing kicks from restarts. Of O\u2019Connor\u2019s four first-half penalty goals, two came directly or indirectly from pressure applied at the restart.\nO\u2019Connor scored Australia\u2019s last points with a penalty goal in the 41st minute. When Smith kicked a penalty goal in the 72nd minute to put England 10 points ahead, the game was all but out of reach, while a runaway try to replacement hooker Jamie Blamire on full-time increased the winning margin to 17 points \u2013 a more accurate reflection of the difference between the two sides.\nThe Wallabies have one last chance to restore some pride against Wales, but they must improve their discipline or risk becoming the first Australian team to lose all Tests on a tour in Europe since dropping two internationals to France in 1976.",

        "content": "The end to the National Affordability Rental Scheme could leave thousands at the whim of the private market\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t see a house as your own, you\u2019re not going to be happy there,\u201d says Marion Trench.\nThe 59-year-old has been renting her townhouse in Bethania, halfway between Brisbane and the Gold Coast, for just under two years, and she loves it. It\u2019s big enough that she can have her grandchildren over to visit. She has furnished it to her particular taste with special secondhand pieces bought at prices she can afford on Facebook Marketplace. She has even planted and grown her own garden.\nTrench hoped this would be her \u201cforever home\u201d. But now she\u2019s afraid she\u2019s about to be priced out.\nTrench is one of 32,000 renters benefiting from the National Affordability Rental Scheme (NRAS), a program developed and implemented by the federal Labor government under former prime minister Kevin Rudd in 2008. NRAS was designed to draw in the private sector to the provision of cheaper housing, by paying property owners a subsidy in exchange for them making new homes available at below-market rents for a decade.\nBut the program was controversial, with critics saying it was too expensive \u2013 costing approximately $3.1bn over its lifetime \u2013 for the relatively small amount of affordable housing it made available. The Abbott government scrapped the scheme in 2014, grandfathering the homes already on it but not allowing new ones to join. That means that over the next three years, the vast majority of NRAS properties are going to lose their subsidy \u2013 and those renters benefiting from it are starting to feel stressed.\nTrench hadn\u2019t heard of NRAS before she found a landlord who offered it. She suffers from osteoarthritis in both hips, degeneration of her lower spine and diabetes. When she was just 36, she had a triple bypass. These issues have left her unable to work; she can\u2019t sit or stand for too long without pain.\nBefore moving into her current home, Trench hopped between the houses of friends and family, usually exchanging board for help around the house. She now pays $272 a week in rent \u2013 half the income she receives from the disability pension \u2013 which is at least $70 off the market rate for identical properties in the complex.\nFor Trench, that difference is substantial.\n\u201cI can manage. I pay my bills fortnightly so I don\u2019t get in arrears, and I manage with food and I have my car,\u201d she says. \u201cBut if I have really to go into the private sector to get what I have here now \u2013 I try not to stress because I\u2019ve still got a couple of years but I know what\u2019s coming. I am panicking.\u201d\nThe largest cluster of NRAS properties \u2013 about 30% \u2013 are in Queensland. About half of all properties nationally are owned and managed by private companies, and half by not-for-profit community housing groups.\nData obtained by Guardian Australia reveals the decline in affordable housing as a proportion of the rental market across federal electorates, with some of the most acute clusters in the electorates of Curtin (WA), Hotham (Victoria) and Canberra.\nWhile community housing groups hope to retain lower rents without the subsidy, rents on privately owned properties are expected to snap back to market rate once the subsidies expire between now and 2026. And the loss of the subsidy for community housing groups means millions of dollars will no longer flow to the community housing sector.\nThe Morrison government has no plans to restart NRAS, and consistently argues that social housing is the responsibility of the states. The upshot for renters, though, is that a whole section of the low-cost rental market is about to disappear entirely.\nCommunity housing advocates say many NRAS renters are likely to transfer across to social housing waitlists when their rent goes up. There were 155,100 households on a waiting list for public housing last year, and 10,900 households on the waiting list for Indigenous housing, according to government data.\nLeo Patterson Ross from the Tenants\u2019 Union of New South Wales says more tenants are calling the organisation, asking about their rights when the rent goes up on their affordable housing.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re a landlord and tenant coming together to make an agreement, the landlord is looking to make a profit, but the tenant is looking for a home. The theory that this is an equal contract was always a fantasy, and the tenancy acts never really address that,\u201d he says.\nPatterson Ross would like to see the federal government reconsider direct capital grants to the states for housing and state tenancy laws overhauled to disallow no-grounds eviction and control rent hikes, both of which he says reduce funding efficacy by making tenancies less sustainable.\nKate Colvin from housing advocacy group Everybody\u2019s Home says that while NRAS has had its flaws, the program opened up much-needed space in part of the rental market that\u2019s particularly squeezed.\n\u201cIn regional communities and some Australian cities there are really low vacancy rates, particularly in the really low-cost end of the market,\u201d she says. \u201cThat makes it much more difficult for people on lower incomes. It also pushes up rents, meaning people miss out on housing, and some become homeless. Getting more affordable rentals into the market opens up choices for people who are struggling.\u201d\nColvin says it\u2019s a problem that needs the fiscal firepower of the federal government to make a difference.\nBut not everyone has a positive assessment of NRAS. A Grattan Institute report slammed it in 2019, arguing that the subsidy it paid property owners of about $11,000 a year \u2013 about $7,000 more than the average value of a 20% rental discount \u2013 was \u201cessentially a windfall gain for developers and landlords\u201d. The report estimated NRAS delivered $1bn to developers and private investors over its lifetime, making it \u201cmore valuable for investors than tenants\u201d.\nFor those renters who were lucky enough to get an NRAS property, though, the lower-than-market rents were a lifeline.\nRuth Johnson says NRAS had \u201ca huge impact\u201d on her life after she unexpectedly became a single parent a few months before her daughter was born. She moved into a Brisbane NRAS property in May 2020.\nJohnson, who works part-time in marketing while solo-parenting her toddler, says it would have been impossible for her to access appropriate housing without NRAS.\n\u201cBeing a sole parent has its challenges anyway, but in a pandemic it\u2019s a massive challenge,\u201d she says. The program has enabled her \u201cto provide a better life for my daughter\u201d.\n\u201cI feel really grateful. I\u2019ve always been very independent and able to make my way through what life throws at me. But becoming a solo parent unexpectedly, I needed support and NRAS was there to offer that support. The thought of being without it is quite frightening.\u201d\nThe NRAS scheme was already being phased out when both Johnson and Trench moved into their homes, but they didn\u2019t know that at the time.\nJohnson was notified earlier this year that the subsidy will expire on her tenancy in May 2022. She hasn\u2019t been told yet how much higher the rent will be after that, but she expects it to go up by $60-$100 a week. \u201cThat\u2019s massive. For me, that means I may have to move out.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve made this place my own now, it\u2019s my home,\u201d says Trench. \u201cI thought it was going to be my home for at least 10 years. Then I was told [the subsidy] was going to phase out in 2024. What am I going to do? I\u2019m on a pension. Where am I going to live on my own?\n\u201cSo many people are saying, \u2018you can share with someone your age\u2019 but I don\u2019t want to share with someone else my age. I\u2019m OCD. \u2026 I\u2019d probably end up in my car.\u201d\nTrench is also worried about the logistics and costs of moving again, when her back injury means she cannot carry more than a washing basket, and her meagre income means paying for removalists is out of the question. She wants to request a long-term, reduced-rent lease from her landlord, but worries they may not agree.\n\u201cLife wasn\u2019t meant to be easy for everybody but sometimes I don\u2019t think it was meant to be this hard,\u201d says Trench.\n\u201cThere are other people that are worse off, but I\u2019ve got to look after me. I\u2019d just like to have my forever home, somewhere that I can afford. I don\u2019t mind paying rent. Hopefully I\u2019ve got another 15 years left in me \u2013 I\u2019d like to think I don\u2019t have to move again.\u201d",

Now, however, with more knowledge and experience with food allergy, views are changing.\nLast month, the National Allergy Strategy, a partnership of patient body A&AA and the peak professional body, Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy, released new best practice national guidelines for schools and childcare facilities. Instead of wholesale reliance on bans of certain foods, the new approach is allergy awareness: educating all staff on risk reduction strategies, how to recognise the symptoms of an allergic response and how to use an EpiPen or Anapen in the event of anaphylaxis.\nThe blanket bans on foods that many Australian children and parents have become used to, says Said, have not served to make schools and childcare centres entirely safe for children with allergies. Mistakes can and do happen. Where food allergy is concerned, says Said, nothing can be more dangerous than giving people a false sense of security.\nSaid says the proposal to end bans does not mean encouraging people to bring in nuts and other allergens to school.\n\u201cRather, we want people to consider what they are packing for their children\u2019s lunches and for there never to be a presumption that a classroom is free of a particular food, because it\u2019s not,\u201d she says.\nThe education sector is instead being encouraged to promote allergy awareness among both staff and students and to use risk reduction strategies such as using non-food rewards, reminding children not to share food, alerting parents about an upcoming activity involving food and ensuring that children wash hands after that activity.\nThe theory is that training staff to minimise exposure with such strategies means that children with allergies should be safer, with less reactions. In the event there is such a reaction, improved understanding of allergies on the part of staff (and children) means that they will be able to recognise the signs of an anaphylactic reaction and be able to respond effectively.\n\u201cIt is the recognition of those signs which is so crucial,\u201d says associate professor Kirsten Perrett of the Murdoch Children\u2019s Research Institute.\nWendy Freeman is a parent of three boys, two of whom suffer from multiple severe food allergies. When her younger son James was six he suffered an anaphylactic reaction accidentally sipping his brother\u2019s milk which he\u2019d assumed was soy milk. First, he came out in hives all over his mouth, then he started wheezing. Freeman administered him with his EpiPen telling her distressed son he would soon feel better. He didn\u2019t. James needed more adrenaline than she could give him. It was only when the mobile intensive care ambulance arrived to administer more, that James\u2019 condition began to improve. For Freeman, it was a wake-up call that, despite her efforts, even in her own household she could not keep her sons from the foods that could trigger them. It meant, she says, that allergy awareness would need to be a priority wherever her sons went.\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nIn the school and childcare environments, Freeman found that how her child\u2019s allergies were managed depended on the staff member. Some knew what to do but others didn\u2019t. A ban on foods, she says, \u201cdoesn\u2019t work as you can never be sure that one hasn\u2019t snuck in. Grandma might have made the sandwich, unaware of that rule.\u201d Consistency is what Freeman needed to feel reassured, especially when her children were young. Consistency in procedures is what the new national guidelines seek to address.\nAustralia has the highest prevalence of food allergy in the world. Some 10% of Australian children develop a food allergy before they are one year old and one in 20 school-aged children are also affected.\nIt is estimated that 10 people die from anaphylactic reactions each year in Australia, some of those relating to food allergy. The exact numbers are unknown as there is no data available. Fatality rates as a result of anaphylaxis have increased in Australia with the increase in prevalence of allergic disease. A proposed national register to collect data on fatalities is one of the recommendations of the A&AA to a parliamentary inquiry on allergy and anaphylaxis in 2019. The report was tabled in June last year but there has been no government response as yet.\nAssociate professor Kirsten Perrett is a paediatric allergist and immunologist at the Royal Children\u2019s Hospital and group co-leader of the population allergy group at the MCRI. Allergies, she says, are a problem of epidemic proportions.\nPerrett explains that the rise in food allergy over the past 30 years has been occurring faster than what you would expect from just genetic change. Environment is the likely candidate for contributing to the rapid rise in the western world and is thought to be connected to the modern lifestyle. Studies have indicated a number of contributing factors referred to by researchers from the MCRI as the five D\u2019s: diet, dry skin, vitamin D, dogs and dirt (hygiene). For instance, a lack of exposure to dirt in modern homes, and lack of absorption of vitamin D (other countries supplement their food chain), have been suggested to increase rates of allergies.\nOf all of these factors, diet is the only one that has, so far, been definitively linked to food allergy. The accepted practice used to be to defer introducing common allergens like peanuts and eggs until an infant was older than one year but research has shown that introducing such foods before that age can reduce food allergy.\nWhile research continues, those with multiple food allergies and their carers must manage their lives in minute detail, reading food labels and watching everything that goes into their mouths.\n \nEmail:\u00a0sign up for our\u00a0daily morning and afternoon email newsletters\nApp:\u00a0download our free app\u00a0and never miss the biggest stories\nSocial:\u00a0follow us on YouTube,\u00a0TikTok,\u00a0Instagram,\u00a0Facebook\u00a0or\u00a0Twitter\nPodcast:\u00a0listen to our daily episodes on\u00a0Apple Podcasts,\u00a0Spotify\u00a0or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app\nThose involved in developing the new guidelines say there is community support for the change from unenforceable food bans to creating a more allergy-aware environment. But while they are recommended as best practice, adhering to the guidelines is not mandatory, and it is up to the individual school and childcare centres to adopt them. Currently, Victoria is the only state of Australia that has legislated measures to protect children at risk of anaphylaxis. A parent of a child with a food allergy must still ask the right questions to be sure of the procedures in place for their child\u2019s protection.\nMCRI\u2019s Perrett believes that children will ultimately be better protected under this new approach. She says the new guidelines will have an undeniable impact in both minimising allergic reactions and in managing them appropriately should they occur.\n\u201cIt will mean better care for children with food allergies and that will save lives,\u201d she says.",

But I\u2019m not impressed with the Conservatives at all. I really fancied Boris Johnson as prime minister but I think he\u2019s a waste of space and I\u2019m quite disappointed in him. I don\u2019t think he inspires confidence. He makes promises he doesn\u2019t keep,\u201d she said.\nThe south-east London constituency has been a Tory stronghold since it was formed in 1983 and has long been considered a safe seat: the popular incumbent, James Brokenshire, who died of cancer in October after 11 years as the constituency MP, won his largest-ever majority of 19,000 in the 2019 election.\nBut on 2 December, residents will head to the polls to elect Brokenshire\u2019s replacement in the wake of the Conservative party\u2019s failed defence of Owen Paterson, the MP who broke lobbying rules, and amid questions surrounding Johnson\u2019s personal conduct as a member of a parliament and claims of cash for peerages.\nMost residents the Guardian spoke to in the middle-class constituency of London commuters, where incomes are above average and unemployment is low, said they were disappointed in the Tories over the sleaze row and Johnson\u2019s handling of the pandemic response. Those willing to speak mostly said that while they felt frustrated by the Conservatives, they would continue to vote for Johnson\u2019s party because they felt that the others had little to offer them. However, some were considering voting against the Conservatives.\nGuy Plunkett, 86, a retired marine insurance broker, said that he had voted Conservative his whole life but was considering voting Labour because he felt the Tories \u201cseem to fall down on promises\u201d, especially about protecting the population from Covid. He added \u201cthe sleaze hasn\u2019t helped\u201d, and that although he agreed with the principle of amending parliamentary standards to enable suspended MPs to appeal, the government \u201cchose the wrong time\u201d to do so.\nTwo residents who run a small business in Bexley village, who asked to remain anonymous, said they would not be voting for the first time due to their disillusionment in politics as a result of the government\u2019s handling of the pandemic, particularly its support for small businesses, which they considered to be unfairly distributed, as well as the corruption allegations. \u201cThe sleaze factor is frightening. I want to know more about it. UK politics has never been like that,\u201d said one of the owners.\nAlthough he said he had been an admirer of Brokenshire, the other business owner said: \u201cI think Boris Johnson is the worst prime minister we\u2019ve ever had.\u201d\nThe pair also felt that politics was dominated by wealthy people who \u201cdon\u2019t know the real world\u201d across all parties. One said: \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult for multimillionaires to form opinions on what working-class people do.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cSo many people we talk to feel it\u2019s not worth voting, people are very disenchanted with politics.\u201d\nIan McCauley, 46, a freelance writer, said he would vote Labour since he is a party member, joking that he was \u201cprobably one of two round here\u201d. He did not expect Labour to benefit from the scandals, however, but observed: \u201cIt\u2019ll be interesting to see what happens with Reform [formerly the Brexit party], they might take a bit of the Tory vote away because of the sleaze row.\u201d\nMcCauley added that he has observed growing numbers of people moving to the constituency from central London boroughs in search of cheaper housing, which he predicted may increase support for Labour.\nAmong these is Jamie Morris, 31, an account manager who moved from a \u201cvery Labour\u201d constituency in central London, who plans to get involved in canvassing for the byelection campaign. \u201cThe Tory government is everything that\u2019s wrong with this country, and everything going on with sleaze, scandal and corruption \u2013 I could never get behind it,\u201d he said.\nCandidates in the running include Louie French for the Conservatives, Daniel Francis for Labour, Simone Reynolds for the Liberal Democrats, Jonathan Rooks for the Green party, and Richard Tice for Reform.\nFrancis, who is midway through his campaign, said sleaze and corruption had been regularly raised on the doorstep. \u201cIt\u2019s cutting through to some residents. Not everyone brings it up, but some people are clearly coming back to Labour who didn\u2019t vote for us in 2019, and other people want to send a protest message to government because of what\u2019s happened over the past week.\u201d\nHe added that people had also been enraged by cuts to the council\u2019s budget and declining public services in the area, despite rising council tax bills. \u201cThey\u2019re beginning to link those two together \u2013 MPs have time to have a second job but don\u2019t have time to resolve the funding issues that local governments have had and get service people on the ground.\u201d\nWhile Johnson has long been a popular figure in the borough dating back to his tenure as London mayor, Francis, a longstanding councillor, said he was seeing residents turn against him. \u201cI\u2019ve heard more people moan about him over the past week than over the past few years. They see he\u2019s in charge of the ship and yet the [sleaze row] isn\u2019t being addressed.\u201d\n This article was amended on 14 November 2021 with reference to named candidates standing in Old Bexley and Sidcup byelection.

        "content": "Baghuz bombing of people trying to escape fighting was covered up, says NY Times report \nThe US military has confirmed for the first time a 2019 airstrike in Syria that killed up to 80 people, mostly women and children, but claimed the strike was justified as it killed Islamic State fighters who were attacking coalition forces.\nThe confirmation from US Central Command followed a report by the New York Times in which former and current Pentagon officials alleged there had been a cover-up of a likely war crime. Central Command argued that because some women and children had taken up arms for IS, whether by indoctrination or choice, they \u201ccould not strictly be classified as civilians\u201d.\nThe strike was carried out on 18 March 2019 on the town of Baghuz on the Euphrates River, which forms the Syrian-Iraq border, where Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), with US air support, were besieging the last organised remnants of IS in Syria.\nThe Times report said two bombs were dropped on a crowd of women and children, trying to escape the fighting on the banks of the Euphrates, who had been identified as civilians by a US drone operated from Qatar. It said the drone operators in Al-Udeid airbase were stunned when they saw the first 500lb bomb dropped by a US F-15E plane, and then a second, 2,000lb bomb dropped on the survivors.\n\u201cWho dropped that?\u201d one analyst asked on a chat system used by those monitoring the drone footage, according to the report. Within minutes, a legal officer flagged a possible war crime that required investigation, and ordered the drone footage and other evidence. The initial battle damage assessment put the death toll at 70. But no independent inquiry was ever carried out.\nThe air force lawyer, Lt Col Dean Korsak, took the case to the Pentagon inspector general, but the subsequent report was stripped of any mention of the strike. Korsak subsequently sent details of the incident to the Senate armed services committee.\n\u201cI\u2019m putting myself at great risk of military retaliation for sending this,\u201d Korsak wrote to the committee, in emails obtained by the Times. \u201cSenior ranking US military officials intentionally and systematically circumvented the deliberate strike process.\u201d\nGene Tate, a civilian analyst in the inspector general\u2019s office, who complained about the lack of action, was forced out of his job.\nThe New York Times investigation found that the airstrike at Baghuz was called in by a shadowy US special forces unit known as Task Force 9, operating independently from the operations centre in Qatar, and which appears to have side-stepped the procedures put in place to minimise civilian casualties.\nUS Central Command said the context for the airstrikes was a desperate last stand by IS, referred to by the alternative acronym, Isis.\n\u201cThe Isis pocket included thousands of fighters and family members including women and children,\u201d said Capt Bill Urban, the Central Command spokesman. \u201cThe remaining fighters including some women and child combatants, along with many Isis family members, including some who were likely held against their will, decided to make a determined stand in an area that included buildings, tunnels and cliffs. Multiple entreaties to Isis to allow family members to depart the area were rebuffed, and thousands of family members remained in the area of the fighting.\u201d\nUrban said that on the morning of 18 March, IS fighters launched a counterattack on SDF positions that lasted several hours, during which an SDF position was in danger of being overrun, and US special forces called in an airstrike. He said that they were unaware that a drone with a high-definition video footage was in the area and relied on a standard definition feed from another drone.\nAccording to the Central Command account, the drones over Baghuz had used all their Hellfire missiles, so the air support available came from F-15s, which dropped three bombs.\nThe bombs killed at least 16 IS fighters, according to the US military assessment. It also confirmed four civilian deaths.\n\u201cThe investigations were unable to conclusively characterise the status of more than 60 other casualties that resulted from these strikes. The reason for this uncertainty is that multiple armed women and at least one armed child were observed in the video, and the exact mixture of armed and unarmed personnel could not be conclusively determined,\u201d Urban said.\n\u201cLikely, a majority of those killed were also combatants at the time of the strike, however, it is also highly likely that there were additional civilians killed by these two strikes,\u201d he added. An investigation ordered by special forces commanders found the strike was justified as self-defence, and \u201cproportional due to the unavailability of smaller ordinance at the time of the request\u201d.\nAs a consequence however, procedures were changed to require high definition video surveillance before such strikes are ordered, and that the \u201cstrike cell\u201d on the ground should coordinate with any coalition aircraft.\n\u201cWe abhor the loss of innocent life and take all possible measures to prevent them,\u201d Urban said.",

        "content": "Criminal charges are possible for more associates of Donald Trump refusing to cooperate with the House committee investigating the 6 January Capitol attack, a senior Democrat warned on Sunday, two days after the indictment of former White House adviser Steve Bannon.\nAdam Schiff, chair of the House intelligence committee and a member of the panel investigating the deadly Capitol riot, said some witnesses could be offered immunity in exchange for testimony in order to advance the inquiry.\nHe told NBC\u2019s Meet the Press he believed \u201cwithout a doubt\u201d that the justice department decision to charge Bannon with contempt of Congress would \u201cshake loose\u201d defiant Trump associates.\nThat could include the former chief of staff Mark Meadows, who did not show up for a deposition before the select committee on Friday, shortly before Bannon\u2019s indictment was announced.\n\u201cNow that witnesses see that if they don\u2019t cooperate, if they don\u2019t fulfill their lawful duty when subpoenaed, that they too may be prosecuted, it will have a very strong focusing effect on their decision making,\u201d Schiff said.\n\u201cEven before the justice department acted, it influenced other witnesses who were not going to be Steve Bannon.\n\u201cWhen ultimately witnesses decide, as Meadows has, that they\u2019re not even going to bother showing up, that they have that much contempt for the law, then it pretty much forces our hand and we\u2019ll move quickly.\u201d\nSchiff would not be drawn on whether that meant the committee would issue a criminal contempt referral for Meadows, who, unlike Bannon, was a government employee on 6 January. But he said the panel would decide quickly, and that it wanted to make sure \u201cwe have the strongest possible case to present to the justice department, and for the justice department to present to a grand jury\u201d.\nMeadows\u2019 lawyer has said his client will not appear before the committee unless compelled to do so by a judge.\nSchiff conceded that certain witnesses, whom he did not identify, could receive limited immunity instead of criminal referral in exchange for their cooperation, the decisions to be made on a case by case basis.\n\u201cWith certain specific witnesses, we ought to consider it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut as that kind of immunity makes it very difficult to prosecute not just them, but sometimes others, we need to think about it very carefully.\u201d\nSchiff said he saw the developments \u201cas an early test of whether our democracy was recovering\u201d from the turmoil of the Trump administration.\n\u201cBasically \u2026 the Republican party, at the top levels, that is Donald Trump and those around him, seem to feel that they\u2019re above the law and free to thwart it. And there\u2019s something admirable about thumbing your nose at the institutions of our government.\n\u201cBannon did what he did because for four years that\u2019s what worked. They could hold Republican party conventions on the White House grounds. They could fire inspectors general, they could retaliate against whistleblowers. It was essentially a lawless presidency and they were proud of it. That ought to concern every American. We need a reestablishment of the rule of law in this country and I\u2019m glad to see that that\u2019s happening.\u201d\nBannon\u2019s indictment, and the threat of charges for Meadows, marked a significant escalation in the House committee\u2019s efforts to get to the bottom of the 6 January riot and Trump\u2019s attempt to overturn defeat by Joe Biden.\nTrump himself is locked in legal battle with the committee over the release of White House documents related to the day of the insurrection, when his supporters ransacked the Capitol.\nOn Thursday, a federal appeals court in Washington DC handed Trump a temporary victory by blocking the release by the National Archives of hundreds of pages of communication logs, memos and other materials ordered by a lower court days before. The appeals court will listen to arguments later this month on Trump\u2019s claim the documents are protected by executive privilege before making a final decision.\nSchiff said he believed efforts to delay the inquiry in the courts would not succeed.\n\u201cThe courts themselves have recognised that Donald Trump essentially played our institutions for four years and played rope-a-dope in the courts,\u201d he said.\n\u201c[They] moved with such expedition to reject Trump\u2019s claims in the district court a week or so ago, now the court of appeals is saying they\u2019re going to have a hearing by the end of the month. Courts don\u2019t generally move that fast and I think it\u2019s a recognition that Donald Trump has relied on justice delayed meaning justice denied. So we and the courts are moving quickly.\u201d",

        "content": "A toothless Manchester City suffered a humiliating 4-0 defeat to the champions Chelsea to ramp up the pressure on their manager, Gareth Taylor.\nA goal a minute in from Jessie Fleming was added to by Sam Kerr, Fran Kirby and Magda Eriksson as they picked City apart at the Academy Stadium.\nCity sit eighth in the WSL table, seven points off the third Champions League spot, and have just seven points from seven games.\nIf there were hopes that this could be the moment to relaunch City\u2019s season then they were very quickly squashed. It took just 67 seconds for Chelsea to take the lead and it was gifted to them. City\u2019s third-choice goalkeeper Karima Taieb passed to Alex Greenwood but it was woefully short and Fleming nipped in, rounded the hapless Taieb and stroked the ball into the net.\nIt was a bruising start but Chelsea\u2019s targeting of Taieb was not unexpected. She has played all of City\u2019s 13 games this season but has struggled to get anywhere near the standards set by the injured Ellie Roebuck and Karen Bardsley. With this latest howler, and after two big errors in City\u2019s defeat to Chelsea in the FA Cup semi-final, the 16-year-old Grace Pilling must surely be in line to start ahead of her.\nDespite that, City had a good spell of play in the first half, with midfielders Caroline Weir and Keira Walsh and the ever-energetic Lauren Hemp helping the home team to edge the midfield battle. Wise to the threat of Hemp, Chelsea manager Emma Hayes had her own dogged and nippy forward Erin Cuthbert virtually man-marking the winger.\nIn stark contrast to the error from her opposite number, Chelsea goalkeeper Ann-Katrin Berger did well to stretch out a leg and push aside a shot from Weir after Walsh had played her in through the middle.\nBerger was on hand again and collided heavily with Hemp as she blocked her shot with both players requiring lengthy treatment. In the resulting five minutes of added time before the break Chelsea struck again. A Ji So-yun cross from the left was nodded down by a falling Guro Reiten at the back post and Kerr poked in.\nDespite City being winless in eight WSL games against Chelsea, Hayes\u2019 side had never won away from home against them in the league with five defeats on their travels.\nMaisie Symonds's added-time free-kick gave Brighton a 1-0 win over Leicester, sending\u00a0the Seagulls up to third in the WSL table, and Anita Asante scored the only goal of the game in the second city derby as Aston Villa secured a 1-0 win over Birmingham. Manchester United had to settle for a 1-1 draw at Everton, with Simone Magill's strike for the home side cancelling out Ella Toone's opener for the visitors, and Reading came from 2-0 down to draw 2-2 at West Ham, 19-year-old Emma Harries scoring an added-time equaliser.\nIn the second half Chelsea ramped up the pressure on City\u2019s beleaguered and makeshift back line with two goals in four minutes, both from corners. First, mirroring a manoeuvre used in the Cup semi-final, a short corner to Cuthbert was worked from right to left and back again for the Scot to place into the path of Kirby who sent a curling shot into the far corner. Then, Melanie Leupolz\u2019s inswinging corner was headed in powerfully by the Chelsea captain Eriksson with Taieb seemingly pulling away from an attempt to punch it clear.\nKirby has now scored 17 WSL goals and provided 12 assists in 2021 and is the only player in the history of the league to both score and assist more than 10 goals in a single calendar year.\nAs City\u2019s losses accumulate so does the pressure on Taylor. A staggeringly large injury list means there are some allowances to be made for their early form, but there has still been significant strength in the starting XI each week that makes their points tally and position surprising leading to fingers being pointed at the man organising that talent.",

        "content": "Against the odds and defying the numbers, after a weekend of slings and arrows, Lewis Hamilton took arms against his sea of troubles with a remarkable win. He delivered a champion\u2019s drive under circumstances that might have left a lesser man bowed.\nInstead by coming from 10th to beat his title rival Max Verstappen into second, Hamilton leaves Brazil head held high, having turned what might have been the weekend that ended his championship hopes into one that has reignited them.\nHamilton\u2019s fighting spirit is well documented. He needed every ounce of that character this weekend and draw on it he did to return what might be the defining moment of the season.\nThe 36-year-old\u2019s forward-facing attitude in his pursuit of success is such that his recollection of previous races is often vague. Yet the scale of the achievement was clear as he recalled with clarity the only similar weekend of his career in F3 at Bahrain in 2004.\nThere he came back from 22nd to 11th in the qualifying race and then went on to win in the race itself. Fighting for his career at the time he was re-signed by McLaren afterwards and the rest, well, became history he is still making today. This weekend in Brazil was as important and will likely remain equally indelible in his mind.\nThe scale of the achievement must be measured across the weekend, alongside Hamilton\u2019s sublime delivery of the win at Interlagos. This was the comeback of the season after a weekend where he took two separate penalties and effectively made up 25 places though two different races.\nHamilton received a five-place grid penalty for taking a new engine at the start of the weekend and then had to start Saturday\u2019s sprint qualifying from 20th and last, after Mercedes were found to have breached the regulations on their DRS. At which point a win on Sunday was perhaps beyond any ambitions he or his team may have harboured.\nYet he then delivered with clinical, aggressive precision to carve through the field in the sprint qualifying from 20th to fifth, making 15 decisive overtaking manoeuvres to do so. It meant he started from 10th in the race proper and did it all over again when it mattered.\nFor all that Mercedes had a pace advantage in Brazil it was still a magnificent piece of clinical execution, doubly impressive given the pressure of the championship fight. A misjudgment in overtaking across Saturday or Sunday could have ended his title hopes in a nano-second of cartwheeling carbon-fibre wreckage. Hamilton did not pick up a scratch.\nIt was a result he badly needed. Hamilton went into the race trailing Verstappen by 21 points. Now, with three races remaining and 78 points available, the Dutchman leads by only 14. Verstappen holds the advantage but in a season that has ebbed and flowed with such drama, any straightforward denouement is far from a given and with Mercedes\u2019 pace at Interlagos they will feel it is game on.\nAfter his efforts on Saturday the race required every ounce of focus again. In the mix from the off the 36-year-old once more demonstrated commitment and fine judgment in equal measure in making nine passes and becoming the first driver to win at Interlagos from lower than eighth place.\nVerstappen had taken the lead at the start from second on the grid, diving up the inside of Bottas at turn one, while behind them Hamilton launched himself through the field. Up to seventh by turn 10 on lap one, by lap two he had passed Sebastian Vettel for sixth and then immediately dealt with Carlos Sainz for fifth. Charles Leclerc fell a lap later and he was third behind Verstappen\u2019s teammate Sergio P\u00e9rez by lap five. The Mexican duly fell at Descida do Lago after a dogged fight on lap 19.\nA tense chase through the pitstops ensued as Hamilton hunted Verstappen. The pair were slugging it out in lap times until their second stops which left a fight to the flag. Of course with such competitive and closely-matched drivers this was not to be straightforward.\nHamilton grasped his moment on the new rubber and pushed hard. On lap 48 he caught his rival on the back straight with a nose in front but was driven wide through turn four by Verstappen, both drivers going off the track. It was the season in microcosm, the two rivals wheel to wheel and uncompromising, with Mercedes convinced Verstappen had deliberately not turned into the corner sufficiently.\nThe incident was deemed acceptable by the stewards, a decision derided by the world champion. Yet Hamilton regrouped and began another assault. Hard on Verstappen in turn one he forced him on to the defensive and over hugely tense moments, followed it up by finally making it stick through turn four on lap 59. It was the decisive move \u2013 in clean air the British driver stretched his legs and completed a sensational win, 10 seconds in front.\nHe had proved, were any demonstration necessary from the seven-time world champion, that if the title is to be wrested from his grasp it will be one almighty struggle. The win puts him right back in it, outrageous fortune be damned, the title fight on fire once more.\nRed Bull\u2019s Sergio P\u00e9rez was in fourth and Ferrari\u2019s Charles Leclerc in fifth. Carlos Sainz was sixth for Ferrari, Pierre Gasly in seventh for AlphaTauri. Esteban Ocon and Fernando Alonso were in eighth and ninth for Alpine and Lando Norris in tenth for McLaren.",

        "content": "For 60 minutes a first Welsh defeat to Fiji since 2007 looked on the cards as Wayne Pivac\u2019s side huffed and puffed against 14 men. Wales, frankly, were awful for large parts.\nThat they came out on top to record a first win in the autumn was down to a late salvo which saw them score three tries in the final quarter through Alex Cuthbert, Louis Rees-Zammit and Liam Williams. Rees-Zammit\u2019s effort clinched the game as he showed his trademark pace. It was a stunning effort.\nFiji\u2019s Eroni Sau was red carded in the 25th minute for a dangerous tackle to the head of the Wales centre Johnny Williams, but the home side struggled badly even with a man advantage.\nFiji smashed Wales to bits at the contact area. Pivac\u2019s attack was rudderless and lacked direction. It was a relief then for a strong Cardiff crowd when Rees-Zammit put the game to bed.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t coach express pace and I\u2019m really, really pleased for Louis. It was a moment of individual brilliance,\u201d Pivac said. \u201cFiji threw everything at us when they went down a man. They had everything to gain and nothing to lose. The big problem for us for the first 60 minutes was the breakdown.\u201d\nWales\u2019 preparation for the game could hardly have been worse. Prop Tomas Francis withdrew on the morning of the game after failing to recover from a concussion. Josh Adams then injured a calf in the warm-up. WillGriff John and Nick Tompkins stepped in, but John was forced off after just seven minutes for a head injury assessment.\nBy then, Wales were already behind, Waisea Nayacalevu having taken just four minutes to open the scoring. Ben Volavola converted and kicked two penalties either side of Wales hitting back when the impressive hooker, Ryan Elias, was driven over from a lineout maul.\nThe game changed when Sau saw red. He had already tackled Williams to the floor when he went in for a second hit and caught the Welshman. The referee, Nic Berry, consulted his TMO, Stuart Terheege, and initially seemed to suggest he would have been happy with a yellow card, but there was no other option than to show red.\nFiji were reduced to 13 men when London Irish\u2019s Albert Tuisue received a yellow card.\nKieran Hardy promptly sniped over from a scrum and Wales thought they had grabbed a third try when Dan Biggar cross-kicked to Rees-Zammit, whose pace took him to the line. Berry and Terheege ruled out the score for Rees-Zammit being in touch in the buildup as he flicked a Fiji kick back into play. Wales were lucky to be ahead at the break, but Volavola landed a long-range penalty after half-time.\nWales were all at sea. They had no direction, little ambition, and no platform to play off. Even a man light, Fiji showed them how it should be done. Setariki Tuicuvu took a poor Biggar kick, marked it inside his own 22, and set off on a careering run down the left. Vilimoni Botitu was in support and he then found Nayacalevu at full pelt. Nayacalevu beat the covering Liam Williams into the corner and Volavola nailed the touchline kick.\nAn upset looked likely, but Fiji\u2019s Eroni Mawi saw yellow for repeated infringements from his team. Wales took advantage with Elias being driven over for his second try before Cuthbert produced a memorable finish in the corner for his first international try since 2017.\nRees-Zammit then stepped up. Picking up possession inside his own half, he kicked ahead with his weaker left foot. There were plenty of covering Fiji defenders, but Rees-Zammit\u2019s turn of foot was extraordinary. He was first to the ball against all the odds and just got downward pressure before it went dead.\nThere was still time for Liam Williams to put gloss on the scoreline after Tompkins scythed through midfield. Fiji\u2019s Welsh head coach, Gareth Baber, said: \u201cDiscipline cost us the game. One of our players had a rush of blood.\u201d",

The British driver delivered an outstanding comeback to go from 10th on the grid to win, beating his Formula One world championship rival, Max Verstappen, into second and, in so doing, rejuvenating his title challenge.\nHamilton endured a testing weekend at Interlagos, penalised twice, once for a replacement engine and then for a DRS infringement. The world champion then came back from last on the grid to fifth in Saturday\u2019s sprint qualifying race and then overtook half the field on Sunday to seal an unlikely victory.\nHe has 101 wins, seven titles and is attempting to take his eighth in his 15th season in F1. Yet his achievement in Brazil was a standout moment, because of how hard he and his Mercedes team had had to fight. \u201cI just gave it everything,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has definitely been one of the best weekends, if not the best, I have experienced in probably my whole career.\n\u201cI feel that this has been one of the most challenging, if not the most challenging, with the things we have faced through the weekend but, in terms of driving, it has maybe been my best.\u201d\nHis feelings were echoed by the former world champion Damon Hill on Twitter: \u201cThat was one of the best drives I\u2019ve ever seen in F1. By anyone. Utterly awesome.\u201d\nHamilton trailed Verstappen by 21 points going into the race but is now only 14 behind with three meetings left. He emphasised how, despite the penalties over the weekend, he refused to be bowed and got past nine drivers on Sunday to win, including a tense battle against Verstappen. \u201cMentally you can just think it\u2019s over, it\u2019s impossible,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing is if you put your mind to it. That\u2019s really why we just cultivated a positive mental attitude and went in fighting, guns blazing.\u201d\nThe Mercedes team principal, Toto Wolff, echoed the sentiment, bullishly noting how fired up his team were for the final three races in Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi. \u201cThe team has always been together but these decisions have brought us so close together,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s against us. Lewis has felt this all his life. Now we all feel it together and we are going to fight. We are not going to be victims. That is the feeling in the garage.\u201d",

        "content": "The England head coach wants his team to deliver a statement victory over the world champions in their grudge match\nRetaining the Cook Cup is all fine and dandy but what England would really love this week is to settle some old scores. Bitter memories of the 2019 Rugby World Cup final, with a further dash of frustration still lingering from last summer\u2019s British & Irish Lions tour, are already lending their final fixture of 2021 an extra edge and South Africa\u2019s visit to Twickenham feels like a genuine grudge match.\nSatisfying as it is to beat his native Australia for the eighth time in a row, Eddie Jones is keenly aware a stiffer challenge now looms. The Springboks\u2019 characteristically effective 30-15 win over Scotland was another reminder of how tough it remains to knock over the world champions, which is perhaps why Jones reached for a favourite boxing analogy on Saturday night in the wake of England\u2019s similar 32-15 margin of victory.\nSpecifically he has in mind the famous Rumble in the Jungle in 1974 when Muhammad Ali\u2019s \u201crope-a-dope\u201d tactics of leaning on the ropes, covering up and encouraging George Foreman to punch himself out paid legendary dividends in Kinshasha. \u201cIf you are taking on a heavyweight contest and you are fighting against George Foreman who can whack and whack and whack, you have to do something a bit different,\u201d said Jones. \u201cWe have got four days to come up with something a little bit different. And we will.\u201d\nGiven the stunning success Jones enjoyed with Japan against the Boks in the pool stages of the 2015 World Cup, he has more expertise in this specific syllabus than most. A quick dive into the archives reveals he also made Rumble in the Jungle comparisons in 2016 prior to his first game against South Africa as England\u2019s head coach. The hosts ended up winning 37-21 and Jones has always possessed a long memory.\nThe fact remains, though, that England\u2019s 2019 finale in Yokohama against the same opponents could hardly have gone any worse, with Jones\u2019s men effectively flat out on the canvas long before the end. Ten of those red rose starters are still on parade but in some ways Japan feels a lifetime ago. It certainly must do for the Vunipola brothers and George Ford who, along with the injured Anthony Watson and Elliot Daly, are currently on the outside looking in.\nSouth Africa, for their part, will be missing the injured Faf de Klerk, Cheslin Kolbe, Pieter-Steph du Toit and the retired Tendai Mtawarira but all their other key pillars and tactical beliefs remain firmly in place. \u201cI worked with the Springboks for a year so I have a pretty reasonable understanding of what they try to do,\u201d stressed Jones, a consultant to the World Cup-winning Jake White in 2007.\n\u201cSouth Africa have a very clear game plan, based on the accuracy of their kicking, their kick chase, the physicality of their forwards and a very strong scrum. The first thing we need to do is be really consistent in our scrummaging so we don\u2019t allow them access into our half. We have to try to take away their maul and then be really good at neutralising their kicks. If we\u2019re able to do that we can create opportunities to attack against them. Like any team, they have weaknesses in their defence and we\u2019ll be able to find a few of those.\u201d\nEasier to say than do on the biggest occasions, clearly, and Jones has had plenty of time to poke through the ashes of the 2019 debacle, just a week after England had put New Zealand away with the same authority that Ireland showed in Dublin on Saturday. This time, though, he has the ex-Springbok scrum coach Matt Proudfoot on his staff and no one will be getting too far ahead of themselves. \u201cEvery time you play against South Africa and get beaten there\u2019s a lesson there,\u201d said Jones.\n\u201cThey play to their strengths. They play the way they have traditionally been educated to do since a young age. Just like the All Blacks play a catch-pass game, movement game. The great thing about rugby is they can play any of those contrasting styles and be successful. It just depends what players you have and the sort of game you want to play. I only have admiration for what they do.\u201d\nGiven England have yet to concede a try in two games since the arrival of their new defence coach Anthony Seibold, their own foundations are reasonably firm but, with Joe Marler due out of Covid isolation on Thursday, it will be no surprise if the loosehead prop is rushed back into the squad. The 21-year-old debutant Bevan Rodd performed stoutly but the Springboks\u2019 illustrious \u201cBomb Squad\u201d will be a step up from a Wallaby tight five lacking some key stalwarts.\nJamie George\u2019s sore knee is another complication but might Owen Farrell\u2019s ankle injury potentially allow Jones to simplify his selection elsewhere and maximise the rising talent he clearly has at his disposal? If ever there was a moment for the bustling Alex Dombrandt to start at No 8 and and to pit himself against Duane Vermuelen it is surely this Saturday, with the Harlequin\u2019s instinctive understanding with Marcus Smith an obvious plus.\nRe-establishing the midfield combo of Manu Tuilagi and Henry Slade would also make Smith\u2019s life easier, as would the return of the multi-skilled Max Malins on one of the wings.\nWith Freddie Steward looking to the manner born at full-back, England will ideally be hoping to fashion more of the smartly-worked moves that saw Smith send Steward away for his first Test try and again hinted at encouraging progress under the attack coach, Martin Gleeson.\nStay brave and positive and there will be a better chance of those nagging demons being buried. \u201cIt is the final game of the autumn so we want to go away with a good feeling,\u201d said Jones, unable to resist another more risqu\u00e9 analogy. \u201cIt\u2019s like when you go out on a date with a girlfriend, the night finishes well and you can\u2019t wait for the next date. We want to make sure the players have that feeling.\u201d Roll on next Saturday.",

England have so far preferred to keep the focus on reaching the World Cup but the mood is likely to change after Monday\u2019s trip to San Marino.\nSouthgate\u2019s team need only a point from their final Group I qualifier and Conor Coady, who is part of the squad\u2019s leadership group, said the players will hold talks over opposing Qatar\u2019s human rights record after they have qualified. \u201cA conversation hasn\u2019t been had yet because we\u2019ve always said \u2013 obviously we are seeing quite a lot in the news at the minute \u2013 that we make sure we do our job first,\u201d Coady said. \u201cWe make sure we try to get to that competition as quickly as we can and then I\u2019m sure the conversation will be had with the players.\n1. There are three qualifying spots at Qatar 2022, to be played for by 12 teams: 10 group runners-up plus the two highest ranked winners of Nations League groups that have not qualified otherwise. Portugal, Italy, Poland, Scotland, Russia, Sweden and North Macedonia have qualified as runners-up.\u00a0\nEither Wales or the Czech Republic will be runners-up in Group E, but whoever is not will get a spot via the Nations League route. Austria are guaranteed a spot via the Nations League route.\u00a0\n2. The six group runners-up with the best records, excluding games against the bottom side in six-team groups, will be seeded.\u00a0\nPortugal, Scotland, Italy and Russia will be seeded. Wales, who need to draw with Belgium to be sure of being runners-up, would be seeded if they were to win, though a draw would suffice unless Turkey win by four goals in Montenegro, or Turkey win by three and Norway beat the Netherlands by four.\n3. The seeded teams will play at home in the one-off play-off semi-finals, on 24-25 March. The draw on 26 November will determine which semi-finals will provide the home team in the one-off finals, on 28-29 March.\n\u201cIf there is any way players can help going forward and help in different situations, I am sure us as players and part of the England setup will try to do that. At the minute it is tough to speak about it because it is not something we have had a real conversation about.\n\u201cWe are not robots, we are humans, we are seeing things in the news that are going on every day. But we\u2019ve always said to ourselves over the last year that the most important thing is to get to where we want to be, which is to Qatar, and honestly speak about the situation when the time is right.\u201d\nEngland\u2019s players have made a difference on a number of social issues. Coady, who is expected to start in defence against San Marino, pointed to Marcus Rashford\u2019s fight against child poverty and Jordan Henderson\u2019s support for the NHS. \u201cThat is a fantastic part of this England group,\u201d the Wolves captain said. \u201cThe players make an incredible difference trying to use that platform to help different people \u2013 try to help kids with Rashy, the NHS with Hendo.\u201d\nEngland, who have travelled to San Marino without Jack Grealish, Henderson, Mason Mount, Luke Shaw and Raheem Sterling, have handed Conor Gallagher his first senior call-up.

        "content": "Report suggests weak targets could push firms to make millions more of the much more profitable petrol and diesel cars\nWeak EU vehicle emissions targets could allow Europe\u2019s biggest carmakers to produce millions more petrol and diesel cars than necessary up to 2030 in a \u201cwasted decade\u201d for cutting carbon pollution, according to a report.\nAnalysis of car industry sales plans for electric vehicles shared exclusively with the Guardian by Transport and Environment (T&E), a thinktank and campaign group, showed that manufacturers could hit their 2030 EU carbon emissions targets with four years to spare.\nHowever, the report warned that manufacturers could stick closely to their minimum requirements, as has been the case in recent years \u2013 opening up the potential for the industry to sell their more profitable petrol and diesel marques.\nBased on the car industry\u2019s publicly stated commitments for EV production, the study showed there was a gap between what could be achieved and where sales volumes would be if they are kept in line with the EU emissions rules.\nSome vehicle makers could wholeheartedly embrace an electric revolution. But T&E said leaving the rules unchanged would jeopardise the sale of 18m battery-powered models and result in 55m extra tonnes of CO2 pollution \u2013 more than the annual emissions of all the cars in Spain.\nT&E said carmakers got easier targets if they sold heavier vehicles, driving up sales of high-emitting SUVs and plug-in hybrid models, which \u2013 when not charged \u2013 could pollute more than fossil fuel engines.\nThe surge in SUV sales has meant that average engine emissions from three carmakers are actually higher than they were five years ago \u2013 even as they simultaneously green their fleets by making new electric cars. They were: Jaguar Land Rover, Volvo and Mercedes-Benz owner Daimler \u2013 all of which last week signed a pledge at Cop 26 to only sell zero-emissions cars by 2040.\nAlex Keynes, the clean vehicles manager of T&E, said: \u201cThe electric vehicle boom has been driven by EU clean car rules but will falter unless lawmakers step in. Now is the time to set properly ambitious targets if we are to avoid a wasted decade in the race to decarbonise cars.\u201d\nUnder the existing rules, carmakers must reduce emissions relative to 2021 levels by 15% by 2025, and by a proposed 55% by 2030 \u2013 a bigger cut than previously planned. However, T&E argued that the 55% cut is still too lenient, arguing that emissions should fall by 80% by 2030 \u2013 a level that would force carmakers to accelerate from their current plans.\nThe European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association (ACEA) has said that even the 55% carbon reduction target would be \u201cvery challenging\u201d and warned that bans on \u201ca single technology\u201d would not be rational, in part because of meagre electric charger provision in some countries.\nThe emissions rules do not include the UK, where carmakers must report emissions separately following Brexit. However, the UK has copied nearly identical rules that came into force on 1 January, and about half of all cars built in UK factories are exported to the EU.\nA spokesman for Daimler said Mercedes-Benz would be ready to go all electric at the end of the decade, where market conditions allowed. He added that the UK had seen \u201can increase in customer demand for SUVs in recent years\u201d.\nA spokesman for Jaguar Land Rover said electrification was at the heart of its new \u201celectric-first\u201d strategy, with battery versions of all models available by 2030.\nVolvo said emissions data showed it was \u201cone of the industry leaders in reducing CO2 emissions from the cars it sells\u201d because of growing electric and plug-in hybrid sales. The carmaker plans to only sell electric cars by 2030 and to be \u201cclimate-neutral\u201d by 2040.\nA spokesperson for ACEA said manufacturers were fully committed to bringing CO2 emissions down to zero and supporting the EU\u2019s goal of reaching climate neutrality by 2050.\nThey said that car industry investment in EVs was outpacing funding for charging infrastructure, warning that failure to increase spending on the network could lead to electric car uptake stalling.\n\u201cThe auto industry\u2019s efforts must be met with the same level of ambition by the EU and its member states. It is essential that all players work together to create the right supportive framework that will drive consumers towards cleaner mobility options, and thus achieve our common goal of reaching climate neutrality in Europe.\u201d",

        "content": "Japan ranks among the most Covid-immunised countries, but only months ago the story was very different\nEarly this year, as Japan\u2019s coronavirus cases began another ominous rise, the country seemed determined to confirm its reputation as a vaccine backwater.\nHeld up by additional clinical trials, its Covid-19 vaccine rollout lagged behind that of the UK and other countries by several months. And when it finally started offering shots in February, doses were administered at an achingly slow pace, beginning with medical staff and older people. Tens of millions of others were convinced they would have to wait many months before coming within arm\u2019s reach of a health worker\u2019s needle.\nBut today, Japan ranks among the most Covid-immunised countries in the world. As of Friday, more than 94.5 million people, or almost three-quarters of its 125 million population, had received both jabs \u2013 a higher rate than the UK and several other countries that began their rollouts much earlier.\nDaily Covid-19 cases have plummeted. On Saturday, 202 new infections were reported nationwide, compared with more than 25,000 just three months ago. Tokyo had 24 cases, compared with a record 15,773 on 13 August, days after the closing ceremony of the 2020 Olympics.\nMonths of emergency measures, including a ban on alcohol sales at restaurants and bars, have been lifted and people are returning to sports and other events in significant numbers. Booster shots will be offered from next month, starting with medical workers.\nMedia hype over scares involving the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine in the 1990s and, more recently, with the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, helped turn Japan into one of the least vaccine-confident countries in the world, according to a 2020 Lancet study.\nLess than 30% of people were confident that vaccines were safe, compared with at least 50% of Americans, the study said. A February poll by the Kyodo news agency found that 27.4% of respondents said they did not want to be vaccinated against Covid-19.\nBut data provided by the prime minister\u2019s office shows high Covid-19 vaccination rates across all age groups. More than 92% of people in their 70s have been double jabbed, along with almost 70% of those in their 30s.\nMost surprising, however, is the take-up among younger people, a cohort thought to be more influenced by anti-vax conspiracies and social media disinformation. The most recent data show that 5.4 million children aged 12-19 \u2013 or 60.7% of that age group \u2013 have received two doses.\nNanako Tokunaga, a university student in Tokyo, was initially sceptical when pharmaceutical companies announced they had developed Covid-19 vaccines at the end of last year.\n\u201cI was worried about the side effects, and there were lots of rumours on social media that they caused infertility,\u201d said Tokunaga, 20.\nReassured by pro-vaccination comments by politicians and doctors, Tokunaga received both jabs in August. Many of her friends have done the same since early summer, when TV broadcasts showed long queues outside a walk-in vaccination centre in Shibuya, a Tokyo neighbourhood popular with young people. \u201cIt made us think seriously about the benefits of having the vaccine,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m happy that I decided to go ahead with it.\u201d\nJapan\u2019s complicated relationship with vaccines can be traced to successful class-action lawsuits brought against the health ministry by a small number of parents who claimed \u2013 without presenting evidence of a causal link \u2013 their children had experienced serious side-effects from the MMR vaccine in the 1990s.\nBut Prof Kentaro Iwata, the head of the infectious diseases division at Kobe University hospital, said it was wrong to characterise Japanese people as fundamentally vaccine hesitant, noting the high take-up rate of the flu vaccine.\n\u201cJapanese bureaucrats are quite hesitant when it comes to advocating vaccines, however, particularly after the government lost lawsuits regarding side effects from the MMR vaccine,\u201d he said.\nIwata has been critical of the government\u2019s handling of the pandemic, but praised its approach to inoculations. \u201cThe Covid vaccination programme has been a great success,\u201d he said. \u201cI have never seen something implemented this pragmatically in the history of vaccinations in Japan.\u201d\nInitially, however, even government politicians and health experts were cautious about encouraging people to have the Covid jab. The turning point came in the summer, as Tokyo was preparing to host the 2020 Olympics in defiance of public opinion.\n\u201cThe government was insisting that the Olympics would go ahead, and that made people fearful,\u201d said Riko Muranaka, a lecturer at Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine. \u201cJapan wouldn\u2019t be in the good position it is in now had it not been for the Olympics.\n\u201cThere was also an element of \u2018negativity\u2019 in spurring people to get vaccinated. People decided they should have the vaccine so they could tell other people that they were not a threat. It was a social courtesy, and to protect themselves, of course.\u201d\nThe shift in attitudes is not limited to the Covid-19 vaccine. A panel on Friday said the health ministry should resume actively recommending the HPV vaccine \u2013 which is universally recognised as safe and effective \u2013 to teenage girls. Japan withdrew the recommendation \u2013 but kept the vaccine available free of charge \u2013 in 2013 after sensationalist media reports of alleged severe side-effects.\nAlthough no causal link between the vaccine and side-effects was established, the rate of HPV inoculation fell from 70% in 2013 to less than 1%.\nHinako Sakikawa, a 19-year-old university student, said she initially shared her age group\u2019s scepticism of the Covid-19 vaccine. \u201cIt was new, so I was anxious at first,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought it might damage my health or even threaten my life.\u201d\nSakikawa, who said she and almost all of her initially vaccine-hesitant friends were now fully jabbed, acknowledged that peer pressure had influenced their decision.\n\u201cThere was definitely a feeling that we should have the vaccine, since everyone else seemed to be having it, and we promised we would meet up once we were double jabbed. Now it\u2019s easier to go out and meet friends and do the all the things we couldn\u2019t do before.\u201d",

        "content": "Representatives particularly disappointed by softened language on coal and a lack of funding to pay for loss and damages\nPacific representatives and negotiators have condemned the outcome of the Cop26 meeting as \u201cwatered down\u201d and a \u201cmonumental failure\u201d that puts Pacific nations in severe existential danger, with one saying that Australia\u2019s refusal to support funding for loss and damage suffered by Pacific countries was \u201ca deep betrayal\u201d of the region.\nSome Pacific leaders expressed qualified optimism about the result of the critical climate summit, such as the Fijian prime minister, Frank Bainimarama, who tweeted: \u201cThe 1.5-degree target leaves Glasgow battered, bruised, but alive.\u201d\nBut many other Pacific experts and climate negotiators were disheartened by the result.\n\u201c1.5 is barely alive,\u201d said Auimatagi Joe Moeono-Kolio, a Pacific senior political adviser to the Fossil Fuels Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative.\n\u201cThe first draft of an otherwise very unambitious text had one notable bright spot in it \u2013 the phase-out of coal. This was further watered down. For a planet in crisis, this represents a monumental failure in recognising the clear and imminent danger entire countries are now in, including my own.\n\u201cFor all the hoopla and greenwashing since yesterday, the fundamental fact remains: we are still headed for a two-degree-plus world,\u201d he said.\nFor Samoan negotiator Galumalemana Anne Rasmussen, who is the representative of Small Island Developing States (Sids) to the Cop bureau, the Pacific can only do so much.\n\u201cThe Alliance of Small Island States and Pacific Sids really pushed hard, everyone engaged, but unfortunately it is always up to the developed and rich to determine the fate and direction of these pledges and outcomes.\u201d\nA regional oceans and climate expert from Tonga, Taholo Kami, agreed: \u201cI think we may be finding leadership at subnational and national level, private sector and even consumer and community level offer more hope at this time than the lethargic Cop process where we are forced to celebrate painful and minimal shifts with text and leave not knowing if this will result in meaningful outcomes.\u201d\nIn particular, Pacific leaders were disappointed by the softened language on \u201cphasing down\u201d rather than \u201cphasing out\u201d coal, and also the lack of strong commitment for funding to pay for loss and damages suffered by Pacific nations due to the climate crisis.\n\u201cCop26 also failed to adequately recognise our present reality \u2013 we are facing the impacts of climate change right now,\u201d said Auimatagi, who has worked with Pacific governments under the process of the UN framework convention on climate change. \u201cYet despite their historical responsibility for our current plight, developed nations like the US, UK and Australia refused to support a funding facility for loss and damage which, in Australia\u2019s case, presents a deep betrayal and abdication of its responsibilities to its Pacific neighbours.\u201d\nHilda Heine, the former president of the Marshall Islands, who has been a key figure in climate negotiations in previous years, tweeted she was \u201cdisappointed EU and US [High Ambition Coalition] members did not rally behind funding facility to support the vulnerable respond to loss and damages caused by industrialised world\u2019s addiction to [fossil fuels] and coal\u201d.\nDespite travel restrictions, costs and risk to health, Pacific islands sent negotiations teams to Cop26 in the hopes of influencing outcomes and ensuring that Pacific concerns were heard.\nThe minister for finance of Tuvalu, one of the atoll nations considered most at risk of disappearing due to sea level rise, gave an emotive speech to the summit in which he spoke of the impact of the climate criss on his country.\n\u201cIt is not fiction, it is not projected to happen in the future \u2013 our land is fast disappearing. Tuvalu is literally sinking. We must take action now.\u201d\nBut even the presence of Pacific negotiators could not influence the outcomes of the Glasgow summit, which as it stands \u2013 even if conditional and unconditional nationally determined contributions for the near-term target of 2030 were met \u2013 projected that warming might still spell the end for some Pacific atoll nations.\n\u201cGoing forward, it\u2019s time we look at not only drastically reducing our fossil fuels consumption, but begin taking serious steps ahead of Cop27 to stop fossil fuel production altogether and begin a just transition before it is too late,\u201d Auimatagi said. \u201cOnly then can we have a real shot of keeping 1.5 alive and ensuring our islands \u2013 and our planet \u2013 survives.\u201d",

        "content": "While 45 aged care residents died from Covid-19, five died from neglect, hearing told\nA \u201croot cause\u201d of the tragedy that led to 50 resident deaths at St Basil\u2019s aged care home was an eight-day delay between the reporting of its first Covid case to Victoria\u2019s health department and the testing of all residents, a coronial inquest has heard.\nNew evidence of failures at the home was obtained in recent months, counsel assisting Peter Rozen QC said in his opening address to the inquest, which began on Monday with the names of those who died being read as the court stood in silence.\nRozen referred to an independent expert report dated 11 November 2021 from a specialist emergency physician, Dr Ian Norton.\nNorton\u2019s report said the delay between the first case at the home being reported on 9 July 2020 and subsequent testing was \u201cthe root cause of a serious outbreak not being contained and the subsequent issues at St Basil\u2019s\u201d. At the time, federal government protocols stated testing should occur within four to six hours of a case being identified in aged care.\nThe report also said the decision by the state government to furlough the St Basil\u2019s workforce, the repercussions of managing this falling to the federal government, and failures in coordination between both levels of government, was another \u201croot cause\u201d of the disaster.\n\u201cA successful response to an outbreak of this very infectious virus necessitated a high degree of cooperation and coordination among the various government and non-government agencies involved,\u201d Rozen told the court.\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nOn 21 July the Victorian chief health officer, Prof Brett Sutton \u2013 who will give evidence to the inquest on 24 November \u2013 decided that all staff who worked at the home between 1 and 15 July 2020 would be deemed a close contact and furloughed in the interest of the health of both residents and staff. Rozen said the commonwealth had \u201cgreat difficulty\u201d in finding a suitable number of experienced staff to replace them, and this had a \u201cdevastating\u201d consequence for the residents.\nRozen told the inquest that a number of senior members of the original staff, including doctors from the medical team, warned senior state and federal government officials that furloughing the entire workforce would lead to neglect of residents.\nOne doctor told government officials on 21 July that furloughing the entire staff was a \u201cshocking idea\u201d, using his recent experience at Estia Heidelberg \u2013 where a replacement workforce resulted in medications being lost, meals not being provided, residents not receiving fluids, and other neglect of care \u2013 to stress his concern.\nA senior geriatrician told the meeting that continuity of some regular staff was needed or \u201cdisaster\u201d would occur. The facility manager at St Basil\u2019s told the meeting that it would be \u201cdangerous\u201d to furlough all the staff, Rozen told the court.\n\u201cDespite the concerns of the doctors and the operator of St Basil\u2019s, the 3pm meeting on 21 July 2020 concluded with a decision to press on with the replacement of the entire staff at St Basil\u2019s\u201d the following day, Rozen said.\nSeparately the secretary of the federal department of health, Dr Brendan Murphy, and the then aged care minister, Richard Colbeck, asked chief nursing and midwifery officer, Prof Alison McMillan, to go to St Basil\u2019s on 22 July to assess the situation. Murphy wanted to move the residents out of the home and was concerned about the situation, the court heard, but wanted someone to assess the home to help make a decision.\nMcMillan assessed the home alongside a senior officer from the Victorian department of health.\n\u201cIt appears that they spoke to the senior managers but did not assess the quality of the replacement workforce,\u201d Rozen said. \u201cThey saw no residents, they did not tour the facility.\u201d\nMcMillan emailed Murphy to say she thought St Basil\u2019s was a \u201cfit for purpose facility\u2019 and there was \u201cno need for a significant evacuation of positive residents to hospital\u201d.\n\u201cOn that basis, the question of transferring a significant number of Covid-19 positive residents out of St Basil\u2019s was deferred, only to be revived in the form of a partial evacuation of the residents from late on the 24th of July as the true extent of the neglect became apparent to those at the highest levels of the commonwealth and Victorian governments,\u201d Rozen said.\nSenior commonwealth public servants in Canberra were making decisions about a home they never set foot in, he added. Rozen stressed that the replacement workforce at the home were not to blame, and that a number had gone above and beyond in trying circumstances, working 17-hour shifts for more than a week straight trying to help the residents.\n\u201cThere were far too few of these workers at St Basil\u2019s for them to have provided care at the level the residents deserved and the law required,\u201d Rozen said.\nChristine Golding, whose mother Efraxia, 84, died in the facility after contracting Covid, was the first witness to give evidence. She described her mother\u2019s experience as \u201cextremely dehumanising, sad, and inhumane\u201d.\nShe remembered a call she received from a staff member before her mother\u2019s death, when she was told that if all the staff were sent home, people would die from neglect rather than Covid.\n\u201cIt sent a shiver down my spine,\u201d Golding said.\nWhile 45 residents died from Covid-19, five died from neglect, Rozen told the inquest.\n\u201cI want the true story to be told and documented Australians deserve to know why our aged care Covid-19 preparedness was so poor, and contributed to premature death,\u201d she told the court.\nThe inquest continues.",

        "content": "From rentals the size of a tiny hotel room to Barratt\u2019s pocket-sized new-builds, the market is expanding\nFor Rioch Fitzpatrick, a 39-year-old dubbing mixer for television, home is a tiny studio flat smaller than a standard Premier Inn hotel bedroom. At just 19 sq metres (204 sq ft), his north London \u201cmicroflat\u201d has a shower and lavatory separated from the main room by a partition, without even a separate wash basin.\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably a bit odd, people coming in and seeing your bed in the kitchen, but I\u2019ve just got used to it,\u201d he says. \u201cMy neighbours live in a flat similar to mine \u2013 a couple with a two-year-old kid. That must be really tough.\u201d\nFitzpatrick moved into the studio, on the ground floor of an old townhouse converted into 10 flats, in May 2018 because he was fed up with living in a house share, and liked the area.\nThe flat was refurbished but there are annoying things \u2013 I have to keep moving my bike around to get to the fridge,\u201d he says.\n\u201cI have to sleep with earplugs because the boiler is right above my bed and the fridge is also making noises all night. And my sink is my kitchen sink \u2013 that\u2019s where I wash up and shave and do my teeth.\u201d\nThe rent is relatively affordable at \u00a3900 a month, including gas and electricity, while the rate for a standard one-bed flat in the affluent north London area of Crouch End would cost \u00a31,200-plus. He is always on the lookout for a bigger place and would also like to get on the housing ladder, but has been put off by high property prices.\nFitzpatrick is not alone. As many as one in 15 apartments in London fell below the national minimum standard of 37 sq m for a one-bedroom home between 2011 and 2021, according to analysis of energy performance certificate measurement data conducted for the Guardian by Dr Jon Reades, associate professor of spatial data science at University College London and Philip Hubbard, professor of urban studies at Kings\u2019s College London. The median size of UK properties under 37 sq m dropped to 29 sq m this year and last, down from 30 sq m in 2019.\nThe government has recommended a  minimum space standard of 37 sq m since 2015, although it is not mandatory \u2013 local authorities have discretion to apply it or not.\nMicro homes have been on the rise since 2013, when rule changes designed to beat national housing shortages allowed developers to convert office blocks into apartments without planning permission. They were also allowed to bypass minimum space requirements, until a rule change in April this year allowed councils to apply the standards. Families have talked of the struggle to live in tiny flats, for example at Templefields House in Harlow, where some measure just 18 sq m.\nThe average size of new-build flats in England \u2013 already the lowest in Europe \u2013 is declining: an analysis of 10,000 estate agency listings by LABC Warranty, one of the UK\u2019s three main providers of new-build home warranties, showed that the average new home had fallen to just 67 sq m by 2018, down from 83 sq m in the 1970s. This trend is even more pronounced in London, where land prices are much higher.\nBarratt has recently become the first major housebuilder to launch pocket-sized apartments, in Harrow, north-west London, branded SMRT homes. It is selling 123 apartments off-plan at the former Kodak factory in Eastman Village, mainly one-bed flats with larger two-bed ones also available.\nDesigned with built-in cupboards and wardrobes, slimmer kitchen worktops and pull-out shelves, the one-bed flats measure about 37 sq m, the minimum standard. Joseph Antoniazzi, senior sales manager at Barratt London, says they are aimed at the \u201cInstagram generation\u201d \u2013 young people who commute into London.\nIf they take off, Barratt plans to roll them out across the UK. A buyer taking advantage of the government\u2019s help-to-buy programme, which runs until March 2023, would need to earn about \u00a340,000 a year to buy a one-bed flat.\nThey would suit a single person or perhaps a couple \u201cif you really like the person\u201d, says Neal Hudson, a housing analyst. \u201cThere will be demand for this and it\u2019s got to be attractive to first-time buyers. There are a lot of people who\u2019d rather have a microflat than live in a shared house.\u201d\nThe flats start at \u00a3285,000, significantly cheaper than the average \u00a3321,988 price for homes sold in Harrow in the past 12 months tracked by Rightmove, and the average house price of \u00a3510,515 in Greater London, according to Halifax.\nHowever, when compared with Barratt\u2019s standard one-bed apartments measuring 50 sq m, they cost about \u00a31,000 more per square metre.\nReades\u2019 and Hubbard\u2019s analysis found that micro apartments cost up to 30% more per square metre than average-sized London properties. This is partly because of the costs related to installing electricity and plumbing; every home needs a kitchen and a bathroom. On top of these inflated prices, they point out that residents often struggle with poor ventilation, noise, lack of light and privacy.\nHudson believes micro homes should be for rent, rather than for sale, as \u201cthey are very much designed for a short period of someone\u2019s life\u201d. He is concerned that \u201cpeople end up being stuck in this\u201d, possibly even with a family. It would be better, he says, to \u201cbuy a home that you can live in for a long period so you can ride out any boom and bust\u201d.\nIn the face of the chronic housing shortage and soaring property prices, some developers specialise in building smaller homes. Pocket Living was set up in 2005 to build flats sized 37-38 sq m and sells them at a 20% discount to the average local market rate to help young, middle-earning Londoners buy their first home.\nBolu Sofoluwe, 25, who bought a one-bed Pocket Living flat in Barking, east London, for \u00a3198,400 in January and works for a bank in Canary Wharf, is happy with her property. \u201cI forget that it\u2019s smaller than average,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s more than enough for me.\u201d\nResearch from the Intergenerational Foundation showed that the number of micro homes built in the UK increased almost fivefold in just five years, from 2,139 in 2013 to 9,605 in 2018. They are not just a London phenomenon but are also spread across north-west England, the south-east, and Yorkshire and Humber.\nDespite the boom in small homes, housebuilding is still far below the government\u2019s target of 300,000 new homes a year by the mid-2020s. The number of new-builds declined to 148,000 last year from 178,000 in 2019, according to government figures. In the first six months of this year, construction started on 88,710 new homes.\nWith the pandemic taking its toll on retailers and more people working from home, Hubbard is predicting more conversions of office blocks and retail schemes into micro homes. Every year, between 1,000 and 2,000 new micro apartments come on the market in London, 3% of all new homes.\n\u201cA lot those are not going to be less than 37 sq m, they\u2019re going to follow the national standard but they\u2019re going to be barely above that. It might be fine as student living or as a crash pad but not for someone who wants to live in it for a number of years and make it their home.\u201d",

        "content": "As sales of licensed goods soars, battles loom over the use of works by long-dead artists\nThis summer, the Uffizi gallery threatened to sue Pornhub for using its masterpieces in a \u201cclassic nudes\u201d video. \u201cSome people think of museums as boring, stuffy or dull,\u201d posed the adult streaming site. \u201cBut what if we told you they housed a collection of priceless porn?\u201d The video re-enacted erotic scenes from art history using artworks including Botticelli\u2019s Birth of Venus, housed in the Uffizi in Florence.\nPornhub swiftly took down the unauthorised nudes, prompting debate about who controls the copying of cultural artefacts that are long out of copyright and in the public domain.\nTraditionally, museums have been protective of high-resolution versions of their artworks, charging stiff fees for photos or venue hire. There are multiple reasons: protecting copyrights, preventing forgeries and controlling lucrative revenues from brand deals. In 2019, the Uffizi made about \u20ac1m (\u00a3850,000) in revenue from the sale of photos of its collection. That year, global sales of licensed goods was $293bn (\u00a3214bn), with the art and non-profit sectors seeing the highest growth.\nMuseums around the world are increasingly capitalising on the intellectual property of their priceless pieces, in unexpected collaborations from luxury lingerie to KFC packaging. China is leading this area, with Beijing\u2019s Palace Museum reportedly making $222m (\u00a3162m) through product sales in 2018.\nThese deals offer a lifeline for cash-strapped attractions after Covid triggered a plunge in visitor numbers. The Victoria and Albert Museum\u2019s visitor count fell by 97% to 130,000, forcing it to cut opening hours to five days a week. The executive board has said admissions and finances might never return to pre-pandemic levels.\nBut as in-person activity slumped, sales of licensed goods rocketed, with homeware the best seller. \u201cConsumers have been decorating their homes with new furnishings, wallpapers and wall art, which plays to the strengths of the V&A\u2019s archives,\u201d said Lauren Sizeland, V&A\u2019s head of licensing.\nWhile its doors were closed, the V&A took on 22 new licencees \u2013 in line with normal years \u2013 and launched 1,400 licensed products, from wall art to jewellery and crafting.\nMerchandising museum masterpieces is not new. In 1998, Picasso\u2019s name and signature was licensed to Citro\u00ebn for an undisclosed sum paid to the painter\u2019s son, Claude, the court-appointed administrator of the artist\u2019s estate.\nSince 2019, the Louvre, the world\u2019s most-visited museum, has stepped up its licensing efforts, teaming up with DS Automobiles, the Swiss watchmaker Swatch and the macaron bakery Ladur\u00e9e. The Louvre\u2019s brand partnerships reportedly generated \u20ac4.5m in 2020, compared with \u20ac2.7m in 2019, according to Le Monde. This year, it signed a four-year deal with Japanese retailer Uniqlo and launched a graphic T-shirt collection inspired by the Mona Lisa, Venus de Milo and Liberty Leading the People artworks.\nThese recognisable women also star on Louvre-licensed phone cases and tech accessories manufactured by Hong Kong-based brand Casetify. While some designs are simply images of the artworks, others are designed to look like official tickets. In 2021, the British Museum launched an eye-shadow palette influenced by ancient Egyptian artefacts with Chinese makeup brand Zeesea.\nThese creations are bold and contemporary, driving pop-culture interest from younger, global audiences. Yizan He, co-founder of a Shanghai-based intellectual property licensing agency, Artistory, said museums are turning to merchandise to tap Gen Z audiences, who are more likely to access museum content online, rather than in person. The aim is to make their archives familiar to all.\nArtistory\u2019s designers opt for creative mashups of the old masters (Van Gogh\u2019s Sunflowers is its guaranteed hitmaker). \u201cWe never slap the paintings on to the products, instead we create original patterns inspired by artworks and share them on TikTok and livestreamed events,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to transform something ancient and boring into something modern and exciting.\u201d\nBut these corporate gigs have riled those who fear museums\u2019 cultural heritage is under threat. In 2019, the Louvre partnered with Airbnb on a competition to let one couple stay the night in its hallowed halls. Ian Brossat, Paris\u2019 deputy mayor of housing, wrote in a letter to France\u2019s culture minister, Franck Riester, that \u201cthis use of a public institution for commercial purposes by a digital giant is a shocking political gesture\u201d. Brossat has campaigned to ban Airbnb apartments in Paris\u2019 city centre, arguing that they are pushing Parisians out of the housing market.\nOthers question why galleries should be free to profit from artworks no longer bound by copyright, which in the UK and EU lasts until 70 years after the creator\u2019s death. Then, the work is freely available intellectual property, though in certain countries, including France, museums can claim perpetual moral rights of an author\u2019s work. This gives custodians the right of attribution and ability to take down damaging reproductions.\nDr Grischka Petri, a lawyer and art historian at the University of Glasgow, said it was problematic that museums were acting as trustees of long-dead artists whose works were no longer in copyright. \u201cIt becomes interesting from a copyright perspective when a museum wants to monopolise its public domain collections and prohibit reproductions.\u201d\nHe said museums risked being \u201chypocritical\u201d if they promoted the commercialisation of their collection while also banning usage by others for moral reasons. \u201cMany ancient artworks work in a soft pornographic way anyway,\u201d said Petri.\nIn recent years, as the internet has led to an explosion of low-quality copies, institutions are rethinking their strategy. Covid has accelerated open-access digitisation. Last year, the V&A\u2019s online portal, where audiences can search and view images of 1.5m objects from its collections, had record levels of engagement.\nThe Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam goes further, by letting audiences download high-resolution photos of its collections that include Rembrandt, Vermeer and Van Gogh. Taco Dibbits, the director of collections, explained: \u201cIf they want to have a Vermeer on their toilet paper, I\u2019d rather have a very high-quality image \u2026 than a very bad reproduction.\u201d",

Their current evening traces a lineage to founder-mother of American modern dance Martha Graham through the figure of Robert Cohan, a Graham dancer who was central to the establishment of contemporary dance in the UK, and whose extraordinary late flowering of creativity the Yorke company facilitated, right up until his death earlier this year.\n  It opens with Yolande Yorke-Edgell performing Graham\u2019s iconic early solo Lamentation (1930). The movement itself is minimal and mostly concealed: Yorke-Edgell is sheathed in a cloth tube that shows only the surface effects of the torque and tension within her body. This is expressionism given physical form: it\u2019s all about what happens on the inside.\n  Ballet choreographer Kenneth MacMillan is by no means a direct descendent of Graham\u2019s, yet his Sea of Troubles (1988) resounds with her influence. Danced barefoot, it is full of twists, flexes and floorwork, and its storytelling, based on symbol and psychodrama, recalls Graham\u2019s heightened, declamatory style. Six dancers play characters from Hamlet \u2013 Hamlet, Gertrude, Claudius, the Ghost, Ophelia and Polonius \u2013 but switch roles between scenes, each change signalled by a simple prop or costume such as cloak, crown or shroud. There\u2019s no storyline, but rather a sequence of cameos expressing the dramatic turbulence between characters. Fascinating as a choreographic study, it\u2019s hard going as a dance: highly strung yet curiously detached, and pretty confusing even if you know your Hamlet.\n  Afternoon Conversations with Dancers comprises eight solos (five shown during any single performance) that Cohan began before Covid, then continued to create over Zoom. Its rewards are rich: Pierre Tappon\u2019s startled leaps and plunges, Freya Jeffs spiralling floorwards as if towards some buried enigma, Romany Pajdak in pointe shoes, her torso stretched between poise and strain; best of all, the underlying conviction that the shape and phrasing of the human body is all that a dance needs. For all that, it feels like an unfinished work.\n  Yorke-Edgells\u2019 So It Is is a homage to Cohan for eight dancers, built on the sculptural Graham technique of tension and release, tilts and spirals that Cohan learned, taught and developed \u2013 a stately, somewhat polite mix of tribute and reverence, leavened by outbursts of lyricism.\nYorke Dance Project presents a special evening dedicated to Robert Cohan at the Linbury theatre, London, on Monday 15 November.",

        "content": "Ella Daish to hand Procter & Gamble giant Tampax applicator, made from 1,200 discarded contributions\nA British environmental activist is stepping up her campaign against single-use plastics in period products by calling on the world\u2019s bestselling manufacturer of tampons to make greener alternatives.\nElla Daish, the founder of the #EndPeriodPlastic campaign, will go to the European headquarters of Tampax-maker Procter & Gamble in Geneva on Monday to present executives with a giant tampon applicator, made of 1,200 discarded Tampax applicators found littering British waterways, rivers and beaches.\nShe wants the US multinational, which makes the brands Tampax and Always, to reduce and then remove plastic from its period products, and develop reusable options. Her priority is for the company to end single-use plastic tampon applicators, which are used for seconds and take hundreds of years to decompose.\nProcter & Gamble had increased its product lines containing single-use plastic, she said, in contrast to other companies that had taken action.\nThe British campaigner said she had met more than 10 retailers and manufacturers since launching her campaign in 2018, but Procter & Gamble had been the least responsive. \u201cI am just fed up. I\u2019ve been doing this campaign for over three and a half years and despite being the global leader of these products they are not doing anything. They are falling behind and every other manufacturer and retailer I\u2019ve met is moving in the right direction.\u201d\nIn 2019, Sainsbury\u2019s said it would stop producing plastic applicators for its own-brand tampons, removing 2.7 tonnes of plastic annually. It has since been followed by Aldi, Superdrug and tampon maker Lil-Lets.\nDaish met Procter & Gamble executives in the UK in 2019, but accused the company of \u201cconstantly avoiding the problem\u201d. She said that in response to her critique of single-use plastic, P&G executives told her about their renewable energy supply. \u201cThey say, \u2018We use renewable energy to power our factories,\u2019 which is a cop-out \u2026 It\u2019s irrelevant. What are you saying: \u2018It\u2019s OK to pump out billions of products containing single-use plastic using green energy?\u2019 That doesn\u2019t make it OK. It\u2019s constantly avoiding the problem. There is never any traction and that is what I\u2019m really frustrated about.\u201d\nAfter a call on social media, she asked people across the UK to send her plastic tampon applicators they found polluting their local environment.\nShe was sent boxes filled to the brim with discarded plastic applicators, found in all parts of the UK from the River Clyde to the Isles of Scilly. She said she hopes to return the giant tampon applicator to Procter & Gamble executives in Geneva. \u201cI wanted to create something that you can\u2019t ignore.\n\u201cIt is clear that we need collective and sustained action on all levels to tackle the plastic pollution epidemic, and that includes industry. Manufacturers like Tampax and Always often put the blame on consumers to avoid ownership of the problem, but they must be held accountable.\u201d\nIn 2019 the European Union passed a law banning single-use plastic cutlery, plates, straws, stirrers and cotton buds, which came into effect in July 2021.\nThe law did not ban the use of plastics in tampons, pads and applicators, but requires companies to mark these products as containing plastic, with information about how to dispose of them correctly. Wet wipes, cigarette filters and takeaway beverage cups also have to be marked in this way.\nAll these items, as well as plastic cutlery, straws and cotton buds, are in the top 10 most commonly found items littering European beaches.\nThe government announced in August that it was banning single-use plates and cutlery, and polystyrene cups in England.\nA spokesperson for Procter & Gamble it had been in conversation with Ella Daish for a few years. \u201cWe wholeheartedly agree with Ella that plastics do not belong on beaches and we\u2019re working to address this in line with European waste infrastructure, encouraging correct disposal of the product and applicator in bins to reduce plastic pollution.\n\u201cWe know we have an important role to play in ensuring our products have the lowest impact on the environment, recognising that all products have an impact but in different ways. But solutions are not straightforward, take time and we need to balance the needs of our consumers while striving to find alternatives.\u201d\nProcter & Gamble made reusable period products, as well as tampons with cardboard applicators, the spokesperson added. \u201cWe know that periods are a highly personal topic and what\u2019s right for some is not necessarily right for all. Our goal is to find a solution where people with periods don\u2019t have to compromise quality, while also having the absolute least impact on the earth.\u201d",

This edge does not block out all the sunlight, and is known as the penumbra. It produces a subtle dimming effect that is easily overlooked. Contact with the umbra takes place just before 7.19 GMT, and will cause a distinct shadow to begin crossing the lunar disc. The midpoint of the eclipse, the almost total phase, occurs at 9.03 GMT. The moon then leaves the umbra at 10.47 GMT, and the penumbra just before 12.04 GMT.\nVisibility from the UK is not great, with the moon setting at 7.24 GMT.

        "content": "He has written powerful dramas about the likes of Rupert Murdoch and Dominic Cummings. The playwright explains why he\u2019s now tackling 11 vitriolic TV debates that gripped America\nLast May, the playwright James Graham found himself in the unfamiliar environs of Question Time. He hadn\u2019t planned to become a spokesperson for theatre during the pandemic, but he happened to be promoting the ITV version of Quiz, his hit 2017 play, just as the sector was screaming for a bailout, and he used his platform wisely. One thing led to another. At the same time, he was researching his new play, Best of Enemies, about 11 landmark televised debates between Gore Vidal and William F Buckley Jr in August 1968.\n\u201cI heard the Question Time music and my brain emptied of every single thing I\u2019d ever thought,\u201d he says with a comical shudder. \u201cI\u2019m not naturally good at broadcast media. That\u2019s why it\u2019s fascinating to spend time in the heads of Vidal and Buckley. I was ashamed by the distance between what I could do and what they did. They were impossibly articulate.\u201d\nBest of Enemies, which will be staged at London\u2019s Young Vic, is based on a 2015 documentary of the same name. \u201cI went to bed completely obsessed with it,\u201d says Graham. \u201cAs a political dweeb, I was embarrassed that I\u2019d never heard about these debates.\u201d\nDuring the 1968 party conventions in America, the struggling ABC network attempted to juice its ratings by pitting Vidal, aristocratic chaos agent of the left, against Buckley, arch-conservative editor of the National Review, for the ensuing culture-war fireworks. It worked all too well. The documentary argues that their combative theatricality (they \u201chated each other\u201d Graham says) began the process of reducing political disagreement to a wrestling match, yet in 2021 the idea of 10 million viewers watching two eloquent public intellectuals debate the future of a bitterly divided America seems remarkable.\n\u201cI\u2019m asking: what is a healthy conversation between two people who disagree?\u201d Graham says. \u201cLike everyone else, I\u2019ve been preoccupied with how we talk to one another on our new platforms and how unhealthy and dangerous that sometimes feels. There\u2019s no exchange of ideas, no listening, no empathy. We\u2019re in a really bad place.\u201d\nPhysically, at least, the two of us are in a very nice place. We\u2019re having lunch in a busy restaurant near the Young Vic, where Graham is busy rewriting the script during rehearsals. The draft he sent me five days ago is already out of date and the final version will be something else again. \u201cI take a huge block of ice into a rehearsal room and then we start chipping away at it,\u201d he says. \u201cYou just have to not care about embarrassing yourself.\u201d\nIt helps that he is so self-effacing. He shrugs off the bumper ratings of Quiz (\u201cEveryone was bored and stuck at home\u201d) and frequently frets about sounding \u201cwanky\u201d. He also just loves the process of collaboration. A boyish 39, Graham has enough contagious excitement to make anyone consider jacking in their job and joining a theatre company. \u201cIt\u2019s the best job in the world,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve really missed it.\u201d\nVidal is played by Charles Edwards of Downton Abbey and The Crown (for which Graham wrote a standout episode about Prince Charles) and Buckley, counterintuitively, by Homeland\u2019s David Harewood. So in the play\u2019s flashback to Buckley\u2019s 1965 Cambridge Union debate with James Baldwin, both actors are black. \u201cDavid\u2019s brain is extraordinary,\u201d Graham says. \u201cHe pulled me up and said, \u2018You can\u2019t temper the more unattractive aspects of his politics because I\u2019m playing him. If he hates black people, I need to own that thought in my head.\u2019\u201d\nBuckley was guilty of homophobia as well as racism. In the penultimate debate, Vidal called him a \u201ccrypto-Nazi\u201d and Buckley notoriously turned feral, calling Vidal \u201cyou queer\u201d and threatening to \u201csock you in your goddamn face\u201d. Shocking enough in 1968, it seems unforgivable now. How can a modern audience still sympathise with him? \u201cThat\u2019s a good question,\u201d Graham says. \u201cThe most generous view of Buckley is we\u2019re all capable of being the very worst version of ourselves at the very worst moment. I think audiences can feel, not sympathy, but empathy for his loss of control.\u201d\nGraham is known for giving both sides of a political conflict their due. His 2012 breakthrough This House dramatised the scheming of the whips\u2019 offices during the 1974-79 Labour government with such even-handedness that the audience included a cross-bench alliance of politicians. He\u2019s that rare beast: a political playwright who doesn\u2019t tell you where to stand. \u201cA psychologist would probably assign to where I grew up my interest in differences of opinion,\u201d he says.\nThis was the Nottinghamshire mining village of Annesley, where the miners\u2019 strike led to a kind of civil war. His forthcoming BBC drama Sherwood explores how a double murder years later reopened old wounds. \u201cTo this day people cross the street because of a political choice they were forced to make 40 years ago.\u201d\nIn hits such as Quiz, Ink and 2019\u2019s Channel 4 drama Brexit: The Uncivil War, Graham harnesses the exhilaration of seeing underestimated outsiders pull off a gamechanging upset to even make you root, at least emotionally, for Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Sun or Dominic Cummings\u2019 Vote Leave \u2013 before he pulls the rug and exposes the grim ramifications. \u201cBasically, everything is a sports movie when I start writing it,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s either Moneyball or Cool Runnings: the underdogs who change the world. I like missions, and the unintended consequences of those missions.\u201d\nBuckley and Vidal are no longer around to pass comment but Murdoch saw Ink twice, which led to mutterings that Graham had a little too much sympathy for the devil. \u201cThe very valid question was: should he have been comfortable watching it?\u201d he says. \u201cAll I can say is that there was a deliberate intention to make people like him, or people who read his newspapers, feel like they could get a defence, but then they have to sit there and listen to the prosecution.\u201d\nFar more controversial was Benedict Cumberbatch\u2019s rendering of Cummings in Brexit: The Uncivil War. The Guardian journalist Carole Cadwalladr accused Graham of portraying Cummings (not then a public figure) as a Sherlockian maverick. Now, after Barnard Castle and all that, does he worry that he wasn\u2019t hard enough? \u201cI go back and forth all the time. Sometimes I think I was too hard, but not very often.\u201d Cummings\u2019 gung-ho contempt for journalists, MPs and judges while he was at No 10 did make Graham think twice. \u201cHe was perpetuating this civil war in a really reckless way given that a woman got killed in that referendum. I wish I\u2019d needled that a little more \u2013 the consequences of that contrary approach to politics.\u201d\nStill, he refuses to villainise easy targets because that would mean preaching to the choir. \u201cIt\u2019s inert, dramatically and politically. I have sleepless nights about that balance and I\u2019ll probably never get it right but I go into it sincerely.\u201d For that reason, Graham is strategically cagey about discussing his own voting history. \u201cIt\u2019s a genuine desire to allow any audience member to come to the work as cleanly as possible,\u201d he says. \u201cI hope that\u2019s a generous instinct and not a self-preservation instinct. I believe we live in a world of polarised extremes and that would be a barrier.\u201d Although, he adds, his general political orientation is hardly a mystery. \u201cI believe in the power of government and of progress. Basic social democracy.\u201d\nHe picks his battles, like campaigning for greater diversity in theatre and access to the arts. \u201cWe don\u2019t talk about class enough. I come from a working-class background in a town that is culturally deprived. How we find people in Mansfield and Kirkby-in-Ashfield a way to experience live arts, and possibly contemplate making some, has gone unanswered. It\u2019s not just doing it because you think you should but because of all the stories you\u2019ll miss if you don\u2019t. I don\u2019t know why we think of art as this sacred thing that takes place in cities with posh people.\u201d\nGraham says he was \u201ca bit of a mess\u201d during lockdown, which he spent alone in south London, but he was certainly productive. Alongside Best of Enemies and Sherwood, he worked on a musical about the televangelist Tammy Faye Messner with Elton John and Jake Shears, the screenplay for an Ink movie, and a livestreamed lockdown play, Bubble. After seven years, he\u2019s still attached to Paul Greengrass\u2019s movie version of George Orwell\u2019s Nineteen Eighty-Four. \u201cIt\u2019s still alive as a prospect,\u201d he says. \u201cWhere I think I failed is \u2013 I was chasing the modern world. That book is already a metaphor so you don\u2019t need to shrink it by saying, \u2018Is Big Brother Facebook?\u2019\u201d\nHis output may seem eclectic but to Graham there\u2019s a common thread: \u201cGreat stories from our recent past that are useful vessels for exploring anxieties and tensions that we\u2019re all dealing with today. Quiz was about truth, information and mob mentality. The theme of Ink was populism. Sherwood takes the social divides of Brexit and finds an equivalent in a town torn apart by the legacy of the miners\u2019 strike.\u201d He laughs. \u201cNone of my shit gets put on in Germany because it\u2019s so unapologetically micro-British.\u201d\nGraham finishes his coffee and heads back to rehearsals, where he will continue to wrestle with the two men who, he says, \u201clive rent-free in my head\u201d. He\u2019s always working towards understanding his characters better, especially the ones he doesn\u2019t agree with. \u201cThat\u2019s why I think the death of drama in schools is terrifying,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause drama forces you to interrogate and empathise with people you don\u2019t like. Twitter is an outrage machine and theatre is an empathy factory.\u201d\nBest of Enemies is at the Young Vic, London, 3 December-22 January.",

In video purportedly from her apartment\u2019s security camera posted online, one of two PPE-wearing individuals is shown hitting the dog with what looks like a crowbar.\nShangrao city authorities apologised on Saturday night for not communicating with the dog\u2019s owner and said the worker in question had been dismissed from the role. It claimed the dog had been \u201cdealt with\u201d.\nThe notice said people in quarantine were supposed to leave their apartment doors open for quarantining but hers had been locked. With the assistance of police the workers accessed her apartment and discovered the dog.\nA hashtag related to the response was viewed about 210m times. Commenters questioned the suggestion the worker had acted without authority and also criticised the censoring of online posts about the incident.\n\u201cWithout the instructions of the leaders above, who would dare to pry the door and kill the dog?\u201d said one.\nIt follows a similar case earlier this month when cats belonging to a Chengdu resident quarantining as a close contact were euthanised. The animals had not been tested for the virus.\nAfter the cat case, An Xiang, director of a Beijing law firm, said on Weibo the science around pet infection was not conclusive. \u201cEmergency measures such as hunting and killing should not be taken \u2026 The relevant unit has no evidence to prove that these pets have been infected.\u201d\nIn September, Harbin officials were accused of overreacting when they euthanised three cats that had returned positive readings for the virus while their owner was in hospital.\nThe cases have prompted waves of fear among pet owners and confusion among local authorities about laws and official processes, the South China Morning Post reported. Local media noted previous measures to care for the animals while owners were quarantined. As China pursues a zero-Covid strategy and battles a stubborn outbreak of the Delta variant, the criteria for people to be quarantined have widened.\nThere is no conclusive research on the risk of Covid-19 transmissions from pets to their owners. Advice from various national disease control centres is that a Covid patient should be isolated from both people and animals.\nIn July the BBC reported that a study by researchers at Utrecht University found rates up to 18% of Covid in animals belonging to patients, but that the most likely transmission path was from humans to animals. No case of a pet infecting an owner has been recorded.",

        "content": "Three held after man killed in taxi blast \u2026 India and China must \u2018explain themselves\u2019 after Cop \u2026 and Adele opens up to Oprah\nMorning everyone. I\u2019m Martin Farrer and here are the top stories to start the week.\nThree men have been arrested under anti-terrorism laws after a taxi explosion outside Liverpool Women\u2019s hospital that killed the passenger. The men \u2013 aged 29, 26 and 21 \u2013 were detained in the Kensington area of the city and arrested under the Terrorism Act, police said. In the early hours, a street in the city\u2019s Sefton Park area was cordoned off by armed police and some residents evacuated as part of \u201congoing enquiries\u201d. The explosion, which happened shortly before 11am when the Remembrance Sunday silence was due to begin, engulfed the taxi in a fireball. The driver, who managed to escape with minor injuries before the flames spread, is not one of the people arrested. The dead man has not been named.\nThe focus of the police investigation is on whether the blast \u2013 partially captured on this video \u2013 was caused deliberately and whether there is significance in the location. The inquiry is being led by counter-terrorism police who are being assisted by MI5. Here\u2019s everything we know so far about the incident.\nClimate deal \u2013 India and China will \u201chave to explain themselves to poor nations\u201d, warned the Cop26 president, Alok Sharma, after the two Asian countries succeeded in watering down the Glasgow climate pact. Sharma was almost reduced to tears by the last-minute change of wording which committed the world to \u201cphasing down\u201d rather than \u201cphasing out\u201d the use of coal. He said he was \u201cdeeply frustrated\u201d but the final agreement was still better than losing the whole deal. Boris Johnson said that even with the weaker wording, the agreement thrashed out over two weeks in Glasgow \u201csounded the death knell\u201d for coal. Some analysts stressed that it was unfair to single out India as the villain because it cannot phase out coal at the same pace as more developed economies. Pacific countries said the summit was a \u201cmonumental failure\u201d that left their island nations in peril. Our environment correspondent looks at how the deal was nearly lost, but why there is still hope for change.\nAmbulance alarm \u2013 Delays outside hospital A&E departments are causing fatalities and up to 160,000 more people a year are coming to harm because they are stuck outside hospitals unable to be offloaded, a report has revealed. Patients are also dying soon after finally getting admitted to hospital after spending long periods in the back of an ambulance, while others still in their own homes are not being saved because paramedics are trapped at A&E and unable to answer 999 calls. Nursing leaders meanwhile have highlighted 10 pressures on health and social care services which they say have created \u201cunsustainable, untenable\u201d conditions.\nVaccine hope \u2013 A UK company has developed an easy-to-use, skin-patch Covid vaccine that could offer longer-lasting immunity than current treatments. The Emergex vaccine will soon start trials and uses T-cells to remove infected cells from the body quickly after infection, thus preventing viral replication and disease. While the antibodies produced by the current Covid vaccines stick to the virus and stop it infecting cells, T-cells find and destroy infected cells.\nTampon protest \u2013 An environmental activist is stepping up her campaign against single-use plastics in period products by calling on the world\u2019s bestselling manufacturer of tampons to make greener alternatives. Ella Daish will present Procter & Gamble bosses with a giant tampon applicator, made of 1,200 discarded Tampax applicators found littering British waterways, rivers and beaches. \u201cI wanted to create something that you can\u2019t ignore,\u201d she said.\n\u2018Walking through concrete\u2019 \u2013 Adele has opened up to Oprah Winfrey on divorce, losing weight and how much she can deadlift, as well as explaining the meaning of new songs on her eagerly awaited album, 30, which is set for release on Friday. Quizzed on some of the \u201cdark\u201d lyrics, the British star says she has struggled in the aftermath of her divorce from charity chief Simon Konecki while maintaining her stellar career and looking after her nine-year-old son. \u201cI juggled those things as well. And I felt like not doing it any more. It made my feet hurt, walking through all that concrete.\u201d\nWe analyse how the global climate deal reached in Glasgow makes some progress but goes nowhere near far enough to avert devastating global heating.\nSorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen $https://audio.guim.co.uk/2021/11/14-79760-20211115TIFcop26deal.mp3\nJames Graham, the playwright whose hits include Quiz, Ink and Brexit: The Uncivil War, has turned his attention to the febrile politics of 60s America for his new project. Graham explains what made him write Best of Enemies, which is about the TV debates between Gore Vidal and William F Buckley Jr in August 1968, why he\u2019s loving being back in theatre and whether he was too soft on Dominic Cummings.\nAgainst the odds and defying the numbers, Lewis Hamilton won the Brazilian Grand Prix, storming to victory from 10th on the grid to cut Max Verstappen\u2019s title race lead to 14 points. Serbia clinched an automatic berth at the 2022 World Cup after a 90th-minute header by the half-time substitute Aleksandar Mitrovic gave them a comeback 2-1 win over Portugal. \u00c1lvaro Morata scored the only goal of the game against Sweden in Seville to ensure Spain finished top of Group B and qualified for Qatar. After Australia completed a remarkable comeback to win their first T20 World Cup, Aaron Finch insisted that even at their lowest ebb he never saw his side as anything other than champions in waiting.\nEngland rugby union coach Eddie Jones wants his team to deliver a statement victory over South Africa in their grudge match this week. England\u2019s footballers plan to discuss how to express their concerns about human rights in Qatar once they have qualified for the 2022 World Cup. The WTA Tour has called on the Chinese government to investigate allegations of sexual assault made by Peng Shuai against a former Chinese vice-premier while also demanding an end to censorship of the former top-ranked doubles player. Roger Federer will almost certainly miss the Australian Open for the second year in a row, with the Swiss maestro said to be recovering slowly from a third round of knee surgery in 18 months. And the Essex chief executive, John Stephenson, is \u201cextremely shocked and saddened\u201d by allegations the club\u2019s former batter Zoheb Sharif received racist abuse that included being called \u201cbomber\u201d by his teammates after the September 11 attacks.\nWeak EU vehicle emissions targets could allow Europe\u2019s biggest carmakers to produce millions more petrol and diesel cars than necessary up to 2030 in a \u201cwasted decade\u201d for cutting carbon pollution. And more than 300,000 workers in the UK will get a pay rise from today as the charity behind the voluntary real living wage raises the minimum hourly rate by 40p to \u00a39.90. The FTSE100 will open down around 0.1% this morning while the pound is on $1.343 and \u20ac1.172.\nThe explosion in Liverpool makes a dramatic lead for many titles today. The Mirror says \u201cTerror probe after taxi blast\u201d and the Times has a very similar \u201cThree held by terror police after fatal blast\u201d. The Mail links the explosion to Remembrance Day with \u201cPoppy day \u2018bomb\u2019 rocks maternity hospital\u201d, as does the Express \u2013 \u201cTerror probe into poppy day blast\u201d \u2013 and the Telegraph: \u201cRemembrance \u2018terror plot\u2019: three held after fatal explosion\u201d. The Sun says \u201cHospital terror blast hero\u201d. The Guardian goes with \u201cFrustration at India and China over watering down climate deal\u201d and the FT has \u201cBusiness groups add to chorus of dismay at watered down Cop deal\u201d. The i splash is \u201cRail plans scaled down in blow for \u2018levelling up\u2019\u201d.\nThe Guardian morning briefing is delivered to thousands of inboxes bright and early every weekday.

The firm runs a fifth of Covid-19 testing sites and half the tier 3 contact tracers, who are mostly required to phone the contacts of people who have tested positive.\nThat work was extended in June, when the company won a \u00a3322m contract to keep Covid-19 test centres running in England and Northern Ireland for another 12 months, with an option to add another six more.\nIn an update on Monday, Serco said immigration-related contracts, particularly in the UK and Australia, had performed better than expected, as had healthcare insurance services in the US after Joe Biden\u2019s administration extended the enrolment period for registering for subsidised health insurance coverage until mid-August.\nSerco provides border control and immigration services in the UK, which includes running the controversial Yarl\u2019s Wood immigration removal centre in Bedfordshire.\nHowever, Serco warned that the driving forces behind its stronger-than-expected performance were unlikely to last. \u201cWe expect 2022 to see much lower demand for Covid-19 related services, partially offset by the impact of new work secured in 2021 and growth in our core non-Covid-19 related business,\u201d the company said.\nThe outsourcing firm announced it would be spending \u00a310m on additional payments for its 52,000 staff \u2013 worth \u00a3100 each \u2013 in response to their work during the pandemic, and would make a one-off contribution worth \u00a34.8m to its people fund to help struggling employees.\nSerco\u2019s shares rose more than 2% on Monday to about 134p.",

Even if it did not, holding it focuses attention on an issue that primarily affects Conservative MPs, and could be embarrassing for ministers.\nStarmer first announced the plan during his regular phone-in appearance on LBC radio, saying he wanted to find a way forward from \u201ca terrible two weeks\u201d prompted by the government\u2019s decision, soon U-turned, to block punishment for Owen Paterson after he lobbied on behalf of companies who were paying him.\nMPs will on Monday vote to overturn the previous Commons decision, instigated by the government, to protect Paterson, who has since resigned as an MP, and introduce a new standards committee with an in-built Conservative majority.\nThe vote would be on whether MPs should no longer hold paid directorships or commercial consultancies, Starmer said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re putting that down,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s for every MP to decide how they want to vote on that. But that will perhaps be a measure of where people are on how we actually move this forwards.\n\u201cI strongly believe that paid consultancies and directorships should just be outlawed. There\u2019s pretty obviously a potential for a conflict of interest, and we\u2019ve seen that in the past few weeks.\u201d\nMore widely, Starmer said, there was a strong case for outlawing all second jobs for MPs, aside from a handful of exceptions with a \u201cpublic service element\u201d, such as MPs who do shifts as doctors, or who are in the army or police reserves.\n\u201cWe can have a debate about where that line is drawn,\u201d he said. \u201cBut beyond that, I think, the time has come, really, to say that second jobs must go.\u201d\nOn Wednesday, Labour will table two separate motions. One will be on ending paid directorships and commercial consultancies.\nThe other will demand the publication of any official papers relating to lobbying done by Paterson for Randox, the healthcare firm that paid him as a consultant, and which won \u00a3500m in government contracts connected to Covid, and on the contracts Randox received.\nSpeaking earlier on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, the Conservative party co-chair Oliver Dowden rejected the warning from Lord Evans, the chair of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, that the Paterson case showed that the UK could \u201cslip into being a corrupt country\u201d.\nDowden said: \u201cI think we are an exceptionally long way from that. Of course we have to learn lessons and of course we have to uphold the high standards in public life.\n\u201cBut the fact that you are subjecting me at a little after 8 o\u2019clock in the morning to a forensic going over in terms of what the government has done \u2013 in a corrupt country you don\u2019t find this kind of level of free press scrutiny and accountability.\u201d\nDowden also defended the decision, taken when he was culture secretary, to re-run the application process for the new chair of the media and broadcasting regulator, Ofcom, after the candidate widely assumed to be the government\u2019s pick, former Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre, was turned down.\nThe job description was then rewritten to favour a candidate more like Dacre, while the new interview panel will include a former Tory adviser who is married to a Conservative MP.\nDowden defended the government\u2019s actions, saying: \u201cThere were various issues with that process which led me to re-running it.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cIf this had been this corrupt process you would be looking at an individual, who you allege was preferred by the government, currently in that role.\u201d",

Subsequent posts and reactions, even keywords such as \u201ctennis\u201d, also appeared to be blocked, and numerous references to Peng were scrubbed from China\u2019s internet.\nThe Women\u2019s Tennis Association (WTA) chair and chief executive, Steve Simon, has called for a \u201cfull, fair and transparent\u201d investigation by the Chinese government.\n\u201cPeng Shuai, and all women, deserve to be heard, not censored,\u201d he said.\nSimon told the New York Times the WTA had received confirmation from several sources including the Chinese Tennis Association (CTA) that Peng was \u201csafe and not under any physical threat\u201d.\nHowever, he said no one involved with the WTA tour had been able to reach her; his understanding was that she was in Beijing but he had not been able to confirm it. He said the WTA had little influence over China\u2019s authorities, \u201cbut we\u2019re not going to back off this position\u201d.\nReferencing an ongoing balancing act by sporting leagues between appeasing the Chinese market and athletes criticising China, Simon said the potential sexual assault of a WTA member was \u201csomething that simply can\u2019t be compromised\u201d.\nThe Guardian has contacted the CTA with questions.\nPeng\u2019s Weibo account is active, but has no mention of Zhang and comments appear to have been disabled.

        "content": "The conditions placed extra importance on winning the toss and it was a better tournament for bowlers than batters\nIt was not the final we wanted, but it was the final we deserved. There was some drama, certainly some skill, and then the team that batted second won, all watched by a crowd that fell some way short of a full house. The T20 World Cup has been a deeply flawed tournament but it nevertheless proved one basic fact: Twenty20 cricket is enormous fun. It also showed that assembling the world\u2019s best practitioners in a single place to play loads of games in a short space of time is a very good idea. Which is just as well, as it is happening again next year, and then every two years after that.\nIt will be remembered for the match-winning batting power of Matthew Wade, Jimmy Neesham, Asif Ali and David Miller, for David Warner showing his critics where they can stick their scepticism, for hard lengths, hard graft and the thrill of seeing the magnificent Shaheen Shah Afridi standing at the end of his run-up, new ball in hand. For England there was glorious failure, the awesome steamrollerings of West Indies and Australia and the combined excuses of injuries, a lost toss and a successful chase of 57 runs from 24 balls by Neesham and Daryl Mitchell to beat them.\nIt has been a tournament of match-ups and mess-ups, of inspiring catches and dispiriting drops, one that while not being won by one of the favourites also featured only one genuine, 21-carat shock \u2013 and that on its very first afternoon when Scotland beat Bangladesh, an upset that sagged in significance with the dawning realisation that Mohammad Mahmudullah\u2019s side were actually completely rubbish.\nThe uneven bounce and unpredictable pace has made this a better tournament for bowlers than for batters, and despite the rising power, skill and aggression of short-form batting it has been the slowest-scoring T20 World Cup ever. However, given that there were less than 48 hours between the last game of the IPL and the start of the World Cup, and the same venues were used for both competitions, they held up admirably. Between them the three World Cup venues have hosted 70 competitive T20 matches in the last two months, an almost unbearable workload. On the subject of workloads, New Zealand played the final on Sunday night and start a T20 series against India on Wednesday, surely some mistake.\nThankfully it is not a competition that will be remembered for the impact of Covid-19, with not one case leaking into the players\u2019 rigidly-enforced bio-bubbles \u2013 the only positive test among players, officials, staff and assorted match-going professionals involved an English journalist. The one significant impact of the pandemic was to force its relocation from India, at which point there were not many alternative hosts to the UAE, headquarters of the ICC and established now as cricket\u2019s equivalent of the mate you used to call when you needed somewhere to crash for a few nights.\nUnlike next year\u2019s football World Cup in Qatar, little has been made of these hosts\u2019 use of forced labour and history of human rights abuses \u2013 Dubai\u2019s reputation having long since been painstakingly fivestarbeachholidaywashed \u2013 but moving the competition threw up practical as well as moral issues.\nThe weather changed markedly during the tournament, from intense heat at the start to verging occasionally on the mild towards its conclusion. But to avoid the worst of the heat and to maximise viewing figures in key Asian markets as many matches as possible were pushed into the evening, at which point the dreaded dew descended. The advantages already built in to chasing really did not need to be further amplified, and the effect has been to massively disadvantage the team batting first, to the extent that it seriously detracted from the sport.\nIn effect, diverting as many have been, every evening match has seen 22 highly skilled sportspeople spend several hours straining to see if they can have a greater impact on the result than the momentary flight of a small metal disc before the action began, and in general they have failed. There are more reasons than just the toss that this became a chasers\u2019 championship, but it is not a good look.\nFor all that every one of the knockout matches followed this script, the two semi-finals were thrillingly tense. A similarly gripping final, ideally won by the side batting first, and the tournament would have been redefined as a sporting success. But Australia took a sledgehammer to that idea, and then used it to set about New Zealand\u2019s bowlers. The result was a sense that this had generally been a tournament of high skill and low drama, and that the next will have much to live up to but a great deal to improve on. Same time next year?",

Police later confirmed that a male passenger was declared dead at the scene.\nThe cab driver, who has been widely named in reports as David Perry, from Kirkdale, managed to escape, and is in hospital in a stable condition.\nThe mayor of Liverpool, Joanne Anderson, has praised the driver, telling BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cThe taxi driver, in his heroic efforts, has managed to divert what could have been an absolutely awful disaster at the hospital.\nShe added: \u201cWell, we knew that the taxi driver had stood out and locked the doors, we knew that early on.\u201d However, she added it was important not to get drawn into speculation about the incident.\nOliver Dowden, the Conservative party chair, told Sky News:\n\u201cClearly we\u2019ll have to see exactly what happened but if that is the case it is another example of true bravery and courage.\u201d\nCarl Bessant was inside the hospital, where his partner had just had a baby, at the time of the blast. He told the BBC: \u201cWe were so close and she was feeding the baby when it happened. We heard a loud bang and looked out of the window. We saw the car on fire and someone jump out \u2026 screaming, and there was someone inside the car.\u201d\nThe police counter terrorism unit for the north-west said three men aged 29, 26, and 21 were detained in the Kensington area of Liverpool and arrested under the Terrorism Act in connection with the incident and continued to be questioned on Monday. The security service MI5 is also assisting.\nThe three arrests took place in Sutcliffe Street, where witnesses reported seeing armed officers swoop on a terraced house on Sunday afternoon.\nKeith Ford, 47, a production operative, who lives in Sutcliffe Street with his partner and 13-year-old daughter, witnessed the dramatic arrests.\n\u201cI\u2019d say about an hour and a half later, a man came out of the property that they were pointing the guns at,\u201d Ford said. \u201cHe came to the front door, police shouted at him, saying \u201chands up in the air\u201d \u2013 then he walked to the pub on the end of the corner.\u201d\nFord described the man as having dark hair, dark trousers and a blue T-shirt.\nHe continued: \u201cA couple of hours later, another man came to the door, the police were shouting at him, saying \u2018hands up in the air, hands up in the air.\u2019\u201d\nHe understood that the occupants of the property changed around two months ago and had not seen anyone since they moved in.\nFord was told to leave his home and spent the night at his parents\u2019 house before returning on Monday morning.\nJan Temple, 61, who lives with her two sons in Sutcliffe Street, was evacuated at 9.30pm on Sunday night. Of the people living in the property, she said: \u201cWe very rarely saw anybody coming or going.\u201d\nSections of Sutcliffe Street and Boaler Street remained cordoned off, with a heavy police presence at the scene as inquiries continued. There was a similar scene at Rutland Avenue in Sefton Park, with counter-terrorism officers sighted in the neighbourhood.\nGreater Manchester police, providing updates from the north-west counter-terrorism unit, said: \u201cA large cordon is in place on Rutland Avenue in Liverpool and a small number of addresses have been evacuated as a precaution.\u201d\nOfficers wearing vests marked \u201cNegotiator\u201d entered the cordon earlier on Sunday afternoon.\nLocals said police arrived from about 1pm. Officers were guarding a terraced property as the immediate surrounding area was cordoned off.\nA number of residents in Rutland Avenue were evacuated from their homes. A police operation continued past midnight with armed officers within the cordon.\nEarlier, images of a vehicle on fire, and later burnt-out, outside the hospital were shared online.\nA spokesperson for Merseyside police said: \u201cSo far we understand that the car involved was a taxi which pulled up at the hospital shortly before the explosion occurred.\u201d\nBoris Johnson said on Twitter: \u201cMy thoughts are with all those affected by the awful incident in Liverpool today. I want to thank the emergency services for their quick response and professionalism, and the police for their ongoing work on the investigation.\u201d\nThe chief constable of Merseyside police, Serena Kennedy, offered her reassurance over the incident. \u201cWhile I understand that today\u2019s incident may cause concern in our communities, it should be pointed out that events of this nature are very rare,\u201d she said.\n\u201cMerseyside police will continue to liaise with community groups, community leaders, partner agencies and individuals in the coming days and weeks to make sure any concerns are addressed and ensuring that we provide the best possible service to local people.\n\u201cThere will also be an increased and visible police presence on the streets of Merseyside and I would encourage people to engage with my officers and raise any concerns they may have.\nLiverpool Women\u2019s hospital said visiting access had been restricted until further notice. Patients were diverted to other hospitals where possible during most of Sunday.\nIn a statement, the hospital said: \u201cAnyone with appointments at the hospital will notice an increased security and police presence on site.\u201d\nPhil Garrigan, the chief fire officer of Merseyside fire and rescue Service, said the car fire at Liverpool Women\u2019s hospital was \u201cfully developed\u201d when two appliances arrived shortly after 11am.\nHe told reporters at the scene: \u201cThe operational crews extinguished the fire rapidly but as has been reiterated by the police chief constable, there was one fatality.\n\u201cAnother individual had left the vehicle prior to the fire developing to the extent that it did.\u201d",

Interpol controls a number of databases containing identifying details of people and property, which assist in global policing. It also operates the system of red notices, which are requests \u201cto locate and provisionally arrest an individual pending extradition\u201d.\nHowever, there are long-running concerns over governments or authorities misusing the system to track down dissidents. While there are clear rules against the use of red notices on refugees, high-profile cases have shown countries are repeatedly able to obtain red notices, against Interpol policy.\nActivists and advocacy groups, as well as 50 members of an international cross-party group of legislators, the Inter-parliamentary Alliance on China, have lodged their objections at Hu\u2019s potential election to the committee, noting alleged attempts by China to use the red notice system to target exiled Uyghur activists.\n\u201cBy electing Hu Binchen to the executive committee, the general assembly would be giving a green light to the PRC [People\u2019s Republic of China] government to continue their misuse of Interpol and would place the tens of thousands of Hong Konger, Uyghur, Tibetan, Taiwanese and Chinese dissidents living abroad at even graver risk,\u201d said the letter from the Alliance, citing the July detention of Uyghur activist Idris Hassan in Morocco.\n\u201cAllowing Interpol to be used as a vehicle for the PRC government\u2019s repressive policies does great harm to its international standing.\u201d\nThe human rights group Safeguard Defenders said the Chinese ministry\u2019s international cooperation department, in which Hu is a senior official, oversaw operations named Sky Net and Fox Hunt, chasing down fugitives overseas.\nIt alleged \u201cteams were sent by the ministry \u201cto intimidate and harass ethnic Chinese to force them to return to China \u2018voluntarily\u2019\u201d.\nIn a report also released on Monday, Safeguard Defenders said there had been a tenfold increase in the issuance of Chinese red notices between 2000 and 2020.\nThe former chairman of Interpol Meng Hongwei was also a ministry of public security official, serving as vice-minister. However, Meng\u2019s Interpol term ended prematurely in 2018 when he disappeared during a visit to China and was later jailed for 13 years on bribery charges, amid Xi Jinping\u2019s anti-graft campaign targeting millions of officials.",

Fenster, 37, was arrested in May 2021 at Yangon international airport as he tried to fly back home to Michigan. He had spent five and a half months in prison.\nSpeaking after arriving in the Qatari capital Doha, Fenster said he wasn\u2019t \u201cstarved or beaten\u201d but was worried his ordeal would never end.\nLooking gaunt after his six-month imprisonment, said he was held for no reason but not mistreated by the Myanmar authorities.\n\u201cI was arrested and held in captivity for no reason... but physically I was healthy,\u201d he told journalists. \u201cI wasn\u2019t starved or beaten.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m feeling all right physically. It\u2019s just the same privations that come with any form of incarceration. You\u2019re just going a little stir-crazy,\u201d said Fenster, who will fly onwards to the US from Doha.\n\u201cThe longer it drags on, the more worried you become that it\u2019s never going to end. So that\u2019s the biggest concern, just staying sane through that.\u201d\nFenster\u2019s family thanked those who had helped secure his release, saying: \u201cWe are overjoyed that Danny has been released and is on his way home \u2013 we cannot wait to hold him in our arms.\u201d\nThe military in Myanmar has imposed a sweeping crackdown on the media since seizing power in February, stripping publications of their licences and banning outlets from broadcasting. It has detained at least 126 journalists, media officials or publishers, of whom 47 remain in detention, according to the UN.\nFenster is the only foreign journalist to be convicted of a serious offence since the coup.\nFrontier\u2019s editor-in-chief, Thomas Kean, said the outlet was relieved that Fenster was finally out of prison, adding that he never should have been arrested. \u201cThe Frontier team would like to thank all who worked to secure Danny\u2019s release over the past five and a half months.\n\u201cBut we also recognise Danny is one of many journalists in Myanmar who have been unjustly arrested simply for doing their job since the February coup. We call on the military regime to release all of the journalists who remain behind bars in Myanmar.\u201d\nThe former US ambassador to the UN Bill Richardson, who recently visited Myanmar, told the Associated Press news agency he had negotiated Fenster\u2019s release during face-to-face meetings with the junta\u2019s chief, Min Aung Hlaing.\nRichardson said in a statement that his team and Fenster would return to the US via Qatar over the next day and a half. \u201cThis is the day that you hope will come when you do this work,\u201d Richardson said in a statement. \u201cWe are so grateful that Danny will finally be able to reconnect with his loved ones, who have been advocating for him all this time, against immense odds.\u201d\nLast week Fenster was sentenced to three years for incitement for spreading false or inflammatory information, three years for contacting illegal organisations and five years for violating visa rules.\nFenster had been accused of working for Myanmar Now, a banned media outlet, in the aftermath of the February coup \u2013 a claim his employer and lawyer say was countered by tax and social security records, as well as testimony from a Frontier employee. Fenster had resigned from Myanmar Now in July 2020 and joined Frontier Myanmar the next month, Frontier Myanmar said.\nHe was due to face two further charges under an anti-terrorism act and under a sedition law. Either case could have resulted in a life sentence.\nThe US, press groups, rights advocates and the UN high commissioner for human rights, Michelle Bachelet, condemned his detention. Bachelet said last week that his trial was \u201cemblematic of the wider plight of journalists in Myanmar who have been facing constant repression since the 1 February military coup\u201d.\nFenster\u2019s family said: \u201cWe are tremendously grateful to all the people who have helped secure his release, especially Ambassador Richardson, as well as our friends and the public who have expressed their support and stood by our sides as we endured these long and difficult months.\u201d",

Footage by the broadcaster ABS CBN showed children at a school in Alaminos line up outside to take their temperatures, complete a health form and wash their hands before entering class.\nStudents, who wore face masks and face shields, sat at desks that were partially covered by plastic windows. To reduce mixing, children are required to eat lunch at their desks and are only allowed to leave the classroom to go to the bathroom.\nWATCH: Teacher Nerissa Tobias has some reminders for her Grade 1 students: follow health protocols and have fun in school | via @arraperezDZMM pic.twitter.com/lyGA9HZPkW\nChildren who attended classes on Monday would be taught in groups of no more than 15, and spend between three and five hours in school, education assistant secretary Malcolm Garma told media prior to the reopening.\nIn September, Unicef identified six countries where schools have remained \u201calmost completely closed\u201d between March 2020 and 30 July 2021: the Philippines, Bangladesh, Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Panama, which gradually reopened schools from 31 May. Of these countries, the Philippines is the last to begin resuming in-person teaching.\nPresident Rodrigo Duterte said in June 2020 that in-person classes would not return until a vaccine was available in the country. He continued to reject proposals to reopen schools this year, warning that doing so would put children \u201cin jeopardy\u201d and that they could also infect elderly relatives.\nOn top of school closures, children in the Philippines have also faced tough lockdown restrictions, including rules banning them from playing outside or in public spaces. Until this month, children in the capital, Manila, have been barred from going to indoor restaurants, shops and arcades. Earlier in the pandemic, doctors\u2019 groups had advised against allowing young children into malls, arguing they are less able to follow disease control measures such as wearing a mask.\nEducation advocates said the prolonged closure of schools has had a major impact on children\u2019s development and on their mental health. \u201cFor many children, particularly in disadvantaged and poorest communities, schools may be the only place where they can have a chance to learn, especially if parents themselves are uneducated or they are too focused on work due to financial stress,\u201d said Shiena Base, a child protection specialist based in the Philippines for the global education NGO Educo. \u201cWe also fear that as the situation continues, many children will eventually lose interest in school, or will be forced to drop out.\u201d\nAt least 1.1 million pupils did not enrol at school during the last academic year, after the pandemic prompted a switch to remote learning. \u201cWe believe that some children will drop out and simply not return,\u201d said Base.\nA global report by Educo, which included responses from nearly 8,000 children across 12 countries, found that children surveyed in the Philippines, together with those in Bolivia and Guatemela, expressed the strongest desire to study in school. This is possibly because of the drawn-out closure of schools, said Base.\nCases of Covid-19 in the Philippines have fallen since a peak in September, with the country now confirming an average of 2,065 cases over the past seven days, according to Our World in Data, which tracks infections globally. Roughly a third of the population has been fully vaccinated. The Philippines recently began offering vaccination for children aged 12 to 17.",

Father Christmas is then shown presenting his Covid pass at border control, proving he has been vaccinated to a customs officer so he can enter the country without restriction. Most of the complaints made to the UK advertising regulator state the scene is coercive and encourages medical discrimination.\nThe scene sparked controversy on social media, attracting criticism from those in the anti-vaccination movement.\nThe Advertising Standards Authority, which enforces the UK advertising code, said that it is reviewing the complaints to see if they warrant an investigation for a potential breach of the rules.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve currently received over 1,500 complaints regarding this ad,\u201d said an ASA spokesperson. \u201cThe large majority of complaints assert that the ad is coercive, and encourages medical discrimination based on vaccine status. We are currently carefully reviewing these complaints to determine whether there are any grounds for further action.\u201d\nThe 90-second ad, which is set to Queen\u2019s Don\u2019t Stop Me Now, premiered on Saturday during ITV\u2019s Celebrity Chase Special. It is being supported by a mix of press and out-of-home advertising, such as poster sites, billboards and bus stops and sides, as well as radio, social media promotion and in-store displays.\nAt launch, BBH, the London-based ad agency behind the campaign, described the ad as a \u201crallying cry to show we\u2019re made of harder stuff this year\u201d.\nTesco has been approached for comment.",

The fare, a man, asked to be taken to the Liverpool Women\u2019s hospital, which was about 10 minutes away.\nAs the taxi approached the drop-off point at the hospital, an explosion occurred from within the car, which quickly engulfed it in flames.\nThe driver escaped from the cab and was treated for the injuries he sustained and later discharged from hospital.\nThe prime minister, Boris Johnson, praised the efforts of the taxi driver. He said: \u201cThis is an ongoing investigation so I can\u2019t comment on the details or exactly what type of incident it was, what type of crime it may have been. But it does look as though the taxi driver in question did behave with incredible presence of mind and bravery.\n\u201cBut I\u2019ve got to say this is something that is an ongoing investigation. I think it would be premature to say much more than that.\u201d\nThe Guardian understands Johnson will chair a Cobra meeting on the attack on Monday afternoon. Cobra is shorthand for the Civil Contingencies Committee, which is convened to handle matters of national emergency or major disruption.\nJackson said inquiries indicated that the device was brought into the cab by the passenger, who was declared dead at the scene.\nThe first three arrests took place in Sutcliffe Street, where witnesses reported seeing armed officers swoop on a terrace house on Sunday afternoon.\nKeith Ford, 47, a production operative who lives in Sutcliffe Street with his partner and 13-year-old daughter, witnessed the dramatic arrests. \u201cI\u2019d say about an hour and a half later, a man came out of the property that they were pointing the guns at,\u201d he said.\n\u201cHe came to the front door, police shouted at him, saying \u2018hands up in the air\u2019, then he walked to the pub on the end of the corner.\u201d\nFord described the man as having dark hair, dark trousers and a blue T-shirt. He continued: \u201cA couple of hours later, another man came to the door, the police were shouting at him, saying: \u2018Hands up in the air, hands up in the air.\u2019\u201d\nHe understood that the occupants of the property changed around two months ago and had not seen anyone since they moved in.\nFord was told to evacuate his home and spent the night at his parents\u2019 house before returning on Monday morning.\nJan Temple, 61, who lives with her two sons in Sutcliffe Street, was evacuated at 9.30pm on Sunday night. Of the people living in the property, she said: \u201cWe very rarely saw anybody coming or going.\u201d\nThe fourth arrest took place in the Kensington area of the city, police said.\nA second address was searched in Rutland Avenue in Sefton Park, where police found \u201csignificant items\u201d, Jackson said, adding that further searches would be necessary.\nA cordon was in place at this location on Monday and eight families had been evacuated from the area.\nJackson said the motivation behind the incident was unclear. \u201cThe reason why he then took [the device] to the Women\u2019s hospital is unknown, as is the reason for its sudden explosion.\n\u201cWe are of course aware that there were remembrance events just a short distance away from the hospital and that the ignition occurred shortly before 11am.\n\u201cWe cannot at this time draw any connection with this but it is a line of inquiry we are pursuing.\u201d",

        "content": "JCVI changes guidance on boosters for people aged 40-49 and second jabs for 16- and 17-year-olds\n\nUntil now, Covid booster jabs were only being offered to adults aged 50 and older, and those in at-risk groups. This is now being extended to include all adults aged 40 to 49, and Boris Johnson has said the concept of what constitutes \u201cfull vaccination\u201d will need to be adjusted. This third jab will be given six months or more after the second dose.\nThe Scottish government said 40- to 49-year-olds would be invited to receive a booster once everyone in the earlier priority groups had been offered one, but that they would be able to book an appointment through the NHS portal \u201cshortly\u201d. They were also considering how best to implement the advice for 16- to 17-year-olds. The Welsh government also said it would provide information shortly on how they planned to roll vaccines out to these groups and Northern Ireland is expected to follow suit.The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) is also advising that a second dose of Covid-19 vaccine should be offered to all 16- and 17-year-olds, 12 weeks or more after receiving their first vaccine dose. Previously, only those in at risk groups were eligible for a second dose; other teenagers had to wait until they turned 18.\nPrimarily, to help maintain high levels of protection against hospitalisation, severe illness or dying from Covid-19 this winter, and reduce pressure on the NHS in the coming months. Recent data from the UK and elsewhere have indicated a slight fall in the levels of protection against severe Covid-19 among adults who received their initial two doses some time ago.\nFor 16- to-17-year-olds, the decision to advise on a second dose was based on a review of the latest evidence of the benefits of the vaccine programme, compared with the risks of any side-effects, the JCVI said. Not only does a second dose increase the level of protection and extend the duration of that protection, it may also reduce the risk of onward transmission to vulnerable close contacts, such as grandparents.\nNewly published data from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) suggested that Britons aged 50 years and older who received a third booster dose of either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine increased their level of protection against symptomatic Covid-19 infection to 93.1% for those who had previously received two doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine and to 94.0% for those who previously had the Pfizer jab.\nTwenty weeks or more after receiving their first two doses, the level of protection among those who did not get a booster was 87.4% for those who had had the AstraZeneca vaccine, and 84.4% for those received the Pfizer jab.\n\u201cThis is the first real evidence of the effectiveness of the booster in the UK setting,\u201d said Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia. \u201cThis is perhaps even more impressive when considering that a significant proportion of people who have not yet had their booster will have had an infection and so had some additional protection now. This report also gives reassurance that whether someone had AstraZeneca or Pfizer as their first course, the booster provides similar excellent protection.\u201d\nBecause of the natural lag between acquiring infection and experiencing complications, it is too early to say what the impact of boosters on hospitalisations will be.\nAccording to NHS England, the National Booking System will open for those aged 40-49 from 22 November, allowing those who had their second dose at least 152 days (five months) earlier to book a third jab \u2013 although the appointment itself won\u2019t take place until at least 182 days (six months) after their second dose.\nFor those aged 16-17, the booking service for second jabs will be available from 22 November, with appointments available no earlier than the recommended 12 weeks after their first.\nNot necessarily. The JCVI is advising that booster jabs for adults aged 40 years and over should be either Pfizer or Moderna \u2013 irrespective of the vaccines given for the first and second doses.\nFor 16- and 17-year-olds, the second dose will be the Pfizer vaccine \u2013 the only vaccine currently licensed for this age group in the UK.\nIn the UKHSA study, the level of protection five to six days after the booster dose was similar to that seen in individuals who had received two initial doses but no booster. It is unclear precisely when the additional protection from the third jab would kick in, but the higher levels of protection observed in this study were recorded 14 days post-jab. It\u2019s possible that protection will be higher still as time progresses, although how long this additional protection will last is unknown. It is also unclear whether further booster doses will be required in the future, and if so, when.\nAccording to the JCVI, there is currently no robust evidence of a decline in protection against hospitalisation and deaths among under-40s who have received both vaccine doses. However, since these individuals are at lower risk of severe disease and received their first two doses later than older adults, it may simply take longer for any decline in protection to be detected.\nVaccination of 12- to-15-year-olds is ongoing, with some yet to receive a first dose. However, many scientists believe they should be offered a second vaccine dose in due course. The JCVI said it would continue to closely review all available data to develop further advice.\nThe NHS advises adults to wait four weeks after having a positive Covid-19 test before booking a booster.\nFor 16- and 17-year-olds, the second vaccine dose should be given 12 weeks or more after the first dose, or 12 weeks after a positive Covid-19 test result, whichever is later.",

        "content": "The supply chain crisis will have an impact on what people have for their meal this year \u2013 and the cost\nAfter last Christmas was so badly affected by Covid, there is huge anticipation around next month\u2019s festivities. But Britain\u2019s supply chain meltdown is causing gaps on supermarket shelves \u2013 and price rises \u2013 with warnings of shortages of everything from turkeys to pigs in blankets and even the fizz for the Yuletide toast.\nSo should you be worried about being able to buy all the food you want for a traditional Christmas spread? And what does it tell us more broadly about price rises and food shortages? We looked at the different elements and considered how easy it is to buy them, and, based on current prices, whether they will cost more.\nExtra large turkey crown (frozen) up 83p to \u00a321.33 +4.1%\nThe poultry industry caused much angst with its warning that Christmas dinner was at risk as producers were raising 1 million fewer birds because of a shortage of workers in processing plants. Switching to goose is probably not an option now either, due to the recent closure of the UK\u2019s last two hatcheries combined with an outbreak of avian flu.\nPaul Kelly, managing director of KellyBronze, which produces free range turkeys in Essex, does not expect people to have to go without. The government allowed thousands of seasonal poultry workers into the UK, and any shortfall will be topped up with imported birds, he explains.\nHowever, consumers buying British can expect to pay more as farmers have faced soaring feed, packaging and wage bills. Industry estimates suggest consumers will see price increases of between 5% and 10%, depending on whether they buy from a supermarket or local butcher\u2019s, when birds arrive in store next month.\n\u201cYou will get whole birds and crowns, that will be fine, but there will be a smaller range of stuffed joints with bacon lattices and so on because there aren\u2019t enough people in factories to make them,\u201d explains Kelly.\nTo avoid the unthinkable, many Britons have opted to pre-order a bird or buy a frozen one \u2013 supermarket sales are far ahead of normal levels. These early birds are emptying supermarket freezers; a recent official survey looking at product availability in shops showed they were the item most likely to be out of stock.\nTwelve pack up 12p to \u00a32.87 +4.2%\nThese tasty morsels often top polls of favourite Christmas foods, so a warning from the British pig industry that this year\u2019s supply was under threat owing to a shortage of abattoir workers was met with disappointment.\nThis crisis, which has been heartbreaking for farmers who have had to cull 14,000 healthy animals, has been mitigated by the decision to allow butchers in on temporary visas.\nBut with the food industry\u2019s workforce still depleted due to the post-Brexit exodus, Zoe Davies, chief executive of the National Pigs Association, says firms are trying desperately to catch up.\nShe is hopeful there won\u2019t be a problem, however, pointing to a plentiful supply of streaky bacon and chipolatas which means people can assemble their own in an emergency. Around 80% of bacon and 60% of the pork we eat is imported anyway and she suspects retailers will go abroad for emergency rations rather than disappoint customers.\nWhite potatoes (2.5kg) up 3p to \u00a31.05 +2.9%\nCarrots (1kg) up 3p to 46p +7.0%\nBrussels sprouts (200g) up 13p to \u00a31.25 +11.1%\nWhile this is one food group where shortages might be welcomed, the British Growers Association (BGA) says there are plenty of brussels sprouts. \u201cIt has been a good growing season,\u201d says Jack Ward, chief executive of the BGA. \u201cThe volume and quality of the crops are good. It ticks all the boxes.\u201d\nThere is a sting in the tail, for farmers anyway, as Ward says they are dealing with cost inflation of about 25%. \u201cLabour has gone up by 15% to 20%, fertiliser has more than doubled, while packaging is up 25%. Everything has gone through the roof.\u201d\nOur data showed small price rises and in December veg prices can fall sharply as supermarkets use tactical promotions to pull in shoppers. Ward predicted shortages of some lines, but suggested they would be more obvious to growers than consumers. He says that it won\u2019t be a case of there being nothing to choose from, but that the selection and availability will be depleted.\nOwn label (440g to 550g) up 17p to \u00a34 +4.3%\nEven with Cop26 raising awareness of the need to eat less meat, no one is predicting a shortage of nut roasts, although they look pricier than in previous years. We looked at one mainstream retailer\u2019s recipe and Jara Zicha, a senior analyst at Mintec, the commodities data group, said nearly all the ingredients, including palm and rapeseed oil, brown rice, wheat, almonds and peanuts, had gone up in price over the past year as a result of higher fertiliser, packaging, energy and transport costs faced by producers. Extreme weather events, such as the summer drought that affected the wheat crop in Canada, one of its biggest producers, have also been a factor at a time of extreme demand as economies around the world reopen after Covid. \u201cThere is a lot of pressure on food manufacturers to lift prices,\u201d Zicha says. \u201cSome of these additional costs would be absorbed by the supply chain, but some get passed along to the consumer.\u201d\nPaxo sage and onion stuffing mix (170g) up 11p to \u00a31.20 +10.1%\nYorkshire puddings (own label 12 pack 185-230g) up 5p to \u00a31.04 +5.1%\nBisto onion granules (170g-190g) up 16p to \u00a31.32 +13.8%\nIn recent weeks food manufacturers, including big ones like Marmite-maker Unilever and Nestle, home of the KitKat, have blamed planned price increases on a perfect storm of soaring food ingredient, packaging, transport and energy costs, as well as the the driver shortage that is pushing up wages in the haulage industry. Paxo and Bisto maker Premier Foods is likely to be facing similar pressures.\nThe most recent figures from supermarket industry analysts Kantar showed annual food price inflation hitting 2.1% in October. In our sample shopping basket that figure is higher at 6.3%, but people can shop around to save money, while festive treats like mince pies and Christmas puddings actually cost the same as in 2020.\nThe shop price of groceries such as coffee is more closely linked to the cost of goods, but the situation is muddier with processed foods. Manufacturers can only recommend a price to retailers. Sometimes stores will pass on increases, but when they are substantial, will expect the manufacturer to share the pain.\nOngoing supply chain problems mean shoppers can\u2019t find everything on their shopping lists now, so it is impossible to predict levels of availability in the biggest food sales week of the year. The Office of National Statistics survey data found the supply of only half the products checked was high, while about 9% of items were either sold out or stock was low, including frozen turkeys, sparkling water, pork, milk and pasta (although the picture was better than the week before).\nVeuve Clicquot yellow label 75cl up \u00a33 to \u00a344 +7.3%\nIt\u2019s a first world problem, but experts have also been telling Britons to steel themselves for a shortage of champagne as well as other popular wines, such as New Zealand sauvignon blanc.\nThe higher champagne price is linked to production problems in the region as well the delivery problems bedevilling the whole retail supply chain. Analysts think wine prices more broadly are going up, but just not before Christmas.\nExtra \u201cwine trains\u201d are being laid on to keep supermarket shelves full, but Robert Foye, the chief executive of Accolade Wines which owns Hardys, recently summed up the outlook: \u201cIf you are a consumer, you won\u2019t be out of wine, but you might not be able to get the one you want.\u201d Drinkers should be open-minded, he suggested, and swap sauvignon for sancerre or opt for an English sparkling wine.\nThis uncertain picture has seen Britons start their Christmas preparations earlier than usual. Many shoppers have sought the added security of pre-order food services offered by stores like Marks & Spencer, which are seen to offer more surety than online orders, where you run the risk of last-minute substitutions.\nThere might be gaps on shelves, but supermarket executives are putting their head above the parapet promising shoppers that it will be all right on the night. Simon Roberts, the chief executive of Sainsbury\u2019s, recently wrote to customers promising there would be \u201cplenty of food\u201d and \u201ceven if the exact product you are looking for isn\u2019t available, there will be a good alternative\u201d.\nFresh food is of course fresh food, but you can buy longer-life products, such as a favourite wine or a stuffing mix, now. \u201cThere is still confusion around whether there is a shortage of the actual product or a shortage of distribution capacity,\u201d says Bryan Roberts, an analyst at Shopfloor Insights. \u201cIs there lots of milk? Yes. Are there lots of drivers? No, which is why some stores are not getting deliveries.\u201d\nRoberts suggests you might have to forego some traditions and buy a frozen turkey rather than having a fresh one, for example, or make your own pigs in blankets. In general, he says, embracing frozen food could be the way to go.\n\u201cA lot of stuff is already available frozen: party food, joints, turkeys, pigs in blankets and \u2013 if you are lazy \u2013 roast potatoes,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can have a perfectly adequate, if not delightful, Christmas dinner using 100% frozen food with perhaps the exception of gravy.\u201d It\u2019s a thought.\nExtra large turkey crown (frozen) up 83p to \u00a321.33 +4.1%\nNut roast (own label 440g to 550g) up 17p to \u00a34 +4.3%\nPigs in blankets (12 pack) up 12p to \u00a32.87 +4.2%\nWhite potatoes (2.5kg) up 3p to \u00a31.05 +2.9%\nCarrots (1kg) up 3p to 46p +7.0%\nBrussels sprouts (200g) up 13p to \u00a31.25 +11.1%\nPaxo sage and onion stuffing mix (170g) up 11p to \u00a31.20 +10.1%\nBisto onion granules (170g-190g) up 16p to \u00a31.32 +13.8%\nChampagne (Veuve Clicquot 75cl) up \u00a33 to \u00a344 +7.3%\nYorkshire puddings (own label 12 pack 185-230g) up 5p to \u00a31.04 +5.1%\nTotal cost up \u00a34.62 to \u00a378.52 +6.3%\nData source: Assosia\nThis is based on average prices across the UK\u2019s four biggest grocery retailers.

        "content": "RBA wants wages to grow 3.5% each year, but efficiency and reward need to go hand in hand\nOn Wednesday the Bureau of Statistics will release the latest wages data. It will, as with the GDP figures due next month be massively affected by the lockdowns in the south-eastern states. But the problem of low wages goes well beyond temporary lockdown.\nAmid all the talk of rising inflation and the likelihood of the Reserve Bank increasing interest rates, one thing has frequently been overlooked \u2013 the RBA is as concerned about rising wages as it is about prices.\nWhen announcing the latest decision on monetary policy on Melbourne Cup day, the RBA noted that \u201cwages growth at the end of 2023 is expected to be running at 3%. While this is higher than it is now, it is still below the average over the two decades to 2015.\u201d\nAnd the pertinent point is that 3% wages growth is not enough to warrant the RBA lifting interest rates. Because if wages are growing at just 3%, inflation is likely to still be in the lower part of the RBA\u2019s target range of 2% to 3%.\nIf you want to know what wages growth the Reserve Bank is after we need only refer to governor Philip Lowe\u2019s own comments to the House economics committee in 2018.\nIt is a level of wages growth not seen since 2012 \u2013 through the entirety of the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison period of government.\nThe target is 3.5%.\nThis not a random number Lowe plucked out of the air. It is based on a solid economic principle that wages should grow at the level of inflation plus the growth of productivity.\nAs Lowe told the committee in 2018: \u201cI think wages in Australia should be increasing at three point something. The reason I say that is that we are trying to deliver an average rate of inflation of 2.5%. I\u2019m hoping labour productivity growth is at least one per cent \u2013 and I\u2019m hoping we can do better than that \u2013 but 2.5 plus one equals 3.5.\u201d\nIf the graph does not display please click here\nBecause inflation is targeted and remains relative stable, this means the key to wages growth is productivity.\nThe problem is that while this is a nice theory, over the past decade or so (and even back to the mining boom) wages have grown by less than the combination of productivity and inflation growth:\nIf the graph does not display please click here\nIn the past decade, inflation has risen 20% and market-sector productivity (ie excluding education, health and public administration) has increased 15%. But in that time private sector wages have only gone up 25%.\nIn effect that has covered inflation growth, but workers have not been adequately rewarded for their increased productivity:\nIf the graph does not display please click here\nSo when we have low productivity growth there is little prospect of improved wages growth for workers.\nOn Monday the Bureau of Statistics released its latest estimates for industry-level multifactor productivity. Multi-factor productivity basically examines how effectively labour makes use of new machinery and other \u201ccapital\u201d investments.\nThe story of 2019-20 is not good. Smashed by the bushfires and then the pandemic, multifactor productivity fell in 11 out of 16 market-sector industries:\nIf the graph does not display please click here\nBut while a large part of that was due to the pandemic, which drastically reduced output while notionally keeping people employed, the problem is 2019-20 was not just a one-off.\nWhile it was the worst for over a decade, the number of industries each year producing multifactor productivity growth has now been low for three years. The last time a majority of the 16 market-sector industries increased productivity was in 2016-17:\nIf the graph does not display please click here\nThis highlights that we have a massive wage crisis in this country that is a factor of two aspects \u2013 the first is slowing productivity growth. The second is that workers are not getting rewarded for the productivity growth they do produce.\nThe Reserve Bank wants wages to grow at 3.5% each year. But unless productivity growth increases and the industrial relations system rewards workers appropriately, that will not happen.",

        "content": "A spirit of optimism pervades this compelling film about trying to create an Indigenous Australian haka\nIt\u2019s been a wonderful year for documentaries about Indigenous Australian artists, with Firestarter: Story of Bangarra charting the evolution of the magical Bangarra Dance Theatre and My Name is Gulpilil presenting a portrait, in the spirit of a living wake, of the great Yol\u014bu actor David Gulpilil.\nNow comes director Larissa Behrendt\u2019s Araatika: Rise Up! \u2013 which isn\u2019t about artists per se but certainly about creative expression, poised at the intersection of art and sport, following a group of NRL players as they create the First Nations equivalent of a haka.\nIt\u2019s not on the same level as the aforementioned productions (being a more modest and unprepossessing documentary, with fewer frills) but it\u2019s nevertheless a warming and compelling watch, populated by likeable people pursuing a valuable endeavour. Splashes of visual bravado indicate a desire to create a more cinematically elevated work, which, while only partially realised, sprinkles the film with lovely images such as an opening drone shot of beautiful green terrain that lateralises the title, moving into the air and reaching towards the heavens.\nWe\u2019re soon taken to moments of action on the footy oval intercut with vision of an Indigenous dancer in the mid air, in front of a surreal brown background: a tableau divorced from space and time. This reminded me of Laurence Billiet\u2019s Cathy Freeman documentary, Freeman, which also embraces athleticism as a form of expression and is laced with visions of Bangarra performer Lillian Banks playing \u201cthe spirit of Cathy\u201d\u2013 attempting to channel via interpretative dance the emotional journey of the superstar sprinter.\nIn Araatika we meet Dean Widders, former footballer and now Indigenous pathways manager for the NRL, who notes that he\u2019s \u201cseen from an early age what rugby league can do for an Aboriginal community\u201d, with its emphasis on teamwork and sticking up for each other. Widders says watching the New Zealand team perform their haka, and observing the pride with which they do so, \u201calways niggled at me\u201d, given the Australia team had no such equivalent.\nHe sets out on a mission to fill this void, consulting various parties for advice and at one point sitting down with Wesley Enoch, artistic director of Sydney festival, who compares watching sport and experiencing art as similar in the sense that both evoke in observers the feeling of \u201cthat\u2019s part of me up there \u2013 you\u2019re representing me and my culture\u201d. He then delivers a proposition: \u201cGet a mob together and come and dance,\u201d and \u201cLet\u2019s make sure the rest of the world sees.\u201d He gives Widders a platform at the Sydney festival for a performance, and by doing so, also gives the film-maker a tournament movie-esque trajectory, whereby the subjects work and train for a big third-act finale.\nThis is an irresistible development (though it takes almost an hour of running time to get there), marking the kind of narrative inflection point that sometimes prompts a film-maker to modify their original vision to maximise a storytelling opportunity. Behrendt\u2019s direction is a little distractible, partly due to the wealth of potential talking points, some of which are introduced and moved on from quickly.\nAbout half an hour in, for instance, we see visions of people in New Zealand performing the haka in the wake of the Christchurch massacre and are told it was \u201calmost a way of uniting the nation\u201d during a terrible time. This fascinating connection is befitting of more consideration, but it\u2019s over in seconds. Documentarians invariably weigh up such challenges (ie to include or not to include, and if so, for how long) and sometimes settle on half solutions: resolving that the material is too good not to include, but not providing the space for it to be properly considered.\nBehrendt\u2019s directorial style, broadly speaking, is that of a cine-essayist, talented at fishing through and arranging evidence, particularly when it comes to political and cultural context \u2013 an approach especially well-suited to her previous documentary, After the Apology. Just when you feel you have the tone and trajectory of Araatika: Rise Up! pegged, it has a habit of unexpectedly throwing something lovely or arresting at you \u2013 such as the sight of men in traditional Aboriginal makeup and garb walking down a Sydney street, flanking the harbour, en route to the final performance, of which the film\u2019s weight and energy is behind.\nDancers in this finale include Adam Goodes \u2013 recently the subject of The Final Quarter and The Australian Dream \u2013 and the journalist Stan Grant. The latter eloquently identifies the spirit of optimism implicit in Araatika and other recent docos about Indigenous Australians who have made highly significant contributions to public life, among them She Who Must Be Loved, Gurrumul, We Don\u2019t Need a Map and parts of the Australia in Colour series. Grant sums it up when he reflects on how, during moments such as the time Australians took to the streets in droves in the 1960s to welcome back boxer Lionel Rose from Japan, \u201cYou can believe in something else: that there is another Australia, a better Australia.\u201d\nAraatika: Rise Up! is streaming at the Sydney film festival On Demand until 21 November. It will air on NITV in 2022.",

As a result, the member for Northern Tablelands and NSW agriculture minister, Adam Marshall, said the government had \u201cthe luxury of supporting only the best projects that benefit the community, maintain the highest and strictest development standards and maximise local renewable jobs and investment in the region\u201d.\nCommunities with existing renewable development proposals say they are frustrated that these standards do not apply to them, with Nundle residents citing the Hills of Gold windfarm proposed in 2018.\nMegan Trousdale, an executive member of the community group Hills of Gold Preservation Inc, says at the forefront of community concern is the conviction that their town is an inappropriate location. There have been 666 submissions from a town of under 300 people, with two to one opposing the windfarm.\nShe called on the government to follow its own mandate for renewables \u2013 \u201ccommunity consent and least environmental impact\u201d. The state\u2019s director for energy infrastructure and zones, Chloe Hicks, has previously said social licence was central to the delivery of REZs, the electricity infrastructure roadmap and its enabling legislation.\nTrousdale cited Middlebrook solar farm at Loomberah, 30 minutes\u2019 drive away, and massive solar and wind projects near Coolah as \u201cgreat examples of minimum objection at public meetings, in the media and during public exhibition. That says community consent.\u201d\nChris Eagles, a farmer who lives on the southern side of the Great Dividing Range, said: \u201cCan you imagine the outrage if this happened to the Blue Mountains? Yet it is the same range with the same environmental values.\u201d\nSign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter\nHe added: \u201cThe reason projects in remote and rural areas are attractive to the government is that they impact fewer people. It is precisely because there are less people in these areas that the environmental values are so high.\u201d\nPhil Spark, an ecologist engaged by the community group, opposes the project in its current location. \u201cI support renewable energy 100% [but] we\u2019ve got to get it in the right places to have the minimal impact,\u201d Spark said.\nThe project\u2019s environmental impact statement identified a total development footprint of approximately 513 hectares (1,270 acres), with more than 206 ha of native vegetation to be cleared, including threatened fauna such as koalas, squirrel gliders and booroolong frogs, and flora including a variety of red, ribbon and mountain gum species.\nWhile the environment impact statement says a biodiversity offset strategy will mitigate this, Spark said he did not believe in offsetting \u201cat all\u201d, especially in places like in Nundle where the conservation value was high.\n\u201cYou destroy what\u2019s there today with the intention of someday regenerating the same habitat,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got all those years until that happens and in the meantime species can decline and become locally extinct.\u201d\nIn addition to community concerns about the effect on wildlife and the flow-on effect to tourism, there are serious concerns about the appropriateness of the terrain itself.\nDr Robert Banks, a soil scientist engaged by the community group, said the area proposed for the project was unsuitable for the construction of both the roads and the turbine pads, as steepness and soil characteristics meant construction could cause land slides.\nBanks said landslips would cause further problems, including large sediments entering the upper catchment of the Chaffey Dam and the Isis River that flows into the Hunter, which would impact water quality as well as the dam\u2019s capacity to hold water.\nThe windfarm developer Engie\u2019s general manager, Andrew Kerley, previously told Guardian Australia, \u201cDr. Robert Banks\u2019 assessment is desktop based and without the benefit of site-specific knowledge.\u201d\nBanks said in response that his assessment was entirely field-based.\n\u201cI\u2019m the author of the mapping, which is based on thousands of hours of fieldwork, as well as thousands of soil tests relevant to the region in question,\u201d he said. \u201cI know it well because I have driven, dug and walked over most of the footprint in the course of my work.\u201d\nKerley said: \u201cEngie is committed to developing the Hills of Gold Wind Farm and to making a positive economic and social contribution to Nundle and the New England region. We\u2019re continuing to engage with our stakeholders to ensure the development minimises any proposed impacts to biodiversity and heritage.\u201d\nHe told Guardian Australia Engie had \u201cundertaken several additional technical assessments to identify where these impacts could be further mitigated\u201d.\nTrousdale said the minority of submissions supporting the project expressed eagerness for local job creation. Her group was concerned that the project\u2019s benefits had been overstated, she said, with the developer first estimating the ongoing jobs at 35, later reduced to 16, and the community organisation Re-Alliance\u2019s estimating in its submission that there would be 12 ongoing positions.\nThe Department of Planning, Industry and Environment told Guardian Australia: \u201cThe NSW Government expects all projects to work closely with local communities to make sure they are building in the right places that complement farming and other land uses.\u201d\nThe nearby Liverpool Range windfarm attracted fewer than 100 submissions, some of whichvoiced concerns about the impact of visual and sound pollution. But Greg Piper, a member of the project\u2019s community consultative committee, said on the whole \u201cthe community has been quite supportive\u201d.\nPiper said there would be long-term economic benefits, with money coming into the community through the voluntary planning agreements, and from his point of view it was a question of: \u201cDo we want coal or wind turbines?\u201d\nSign up for the Rural Network email newsletter\nJoin the Rural Network group on Facebook to be part of the community",

Plus letters from Keith Flett, David Nowell and Richard Walker\nYour editorial (11 November) calling for safeguards against sleaze to be strengthened heightens the case for parliament to establish an effective, non-partisan means of systematically holding to account any prime minister for personal breaches of the ministerial code, as well as in instances of gross personal misconduct or\u00a0incompetence.\nThe recent report by Lord\u00a0Evans\u2019s committee on standards in public life avoids this pivotal question, and so have the some 500 backbenchers and more than 700 sitting peers forming our parliament. Yet this matter is becoming ever more crucial for adequately safeguarding the public interest as UK politics becomes ever more populist and presidential. Should it not be examined urgently by parliament\u2019s constitution committee under its remit to keep the operation of our constitution under review? Notwithstanding the political sensitivities involved, the growing chargesheet against Boris Johnson surely provides more than enough grounds for such an inquiry.Steve EltonMary Tavy, Devon\n The tide has undoubtedly turned for Boris Johnson and his government as they become deluged with sleaze, or should we say corruption, allegations. But your editorial (12 November) is absolutely right to point out that the critical factor in shaping our nation\u2019s future will be the British economy over the next two years. The amount and value of cash in people\u2019s pockets will invariably prove a more decisive factor at election time than the politics of sleaze and Brexit lies that we are enduring at the moment.\nIf the chancellor gets the economy right, he may yet inspire some mistaken confidence in another Conservative government. If he doesn\u2019t, the Tories are likely to be out of power and Rishi Sunak will not succeed Johnson as party leader. The stakes are high, but never underestimate the economy.David WalkerDunsfold, Surrey\n As you note, there is a range of areas in public life that need better regulation if potentially corrupt practices are not to flourish. Unsurprisingly, Boris Johnson plans to do nothing about any of them. There may be a price for inaction. The extent of sinecures and political placemen in the 1820s led to pressure for democratic parliamentary reform. It was resisted until, in 1831, Britain came close to revolution. Only at this point was it decided that perhaps the 1832 Great Reform Act was a better way forward. If that\u2019s what it\u00a0takes to get Johnson to act\u2026Keith FlettTottenham, London\n Perhaps one reform would be to publish parliamentarians\u2019 tax returns, as then many surplus members of the House of Lords would rush to retire rather than reveal their intrinsic conflicts of interest (To rid Britain of corruption, start by reforming the House of Lords, 11 November). Plus, this might put off some chancers wishing to stand\u00a0in Westminster elections.\nFurthermore, it\u2019s high time we got rid of non-domiciled tax status for British and Commonwealth citizens living here who are eligible\u00a0to vote. Does any other advanced democracy allow their wealthiest citizens this bizarre\u00a0privilege? David NowellNew Barnet, London\n The prime minister says that the UK is not remotely a corrupt country (Boris Johnson says the UK is not \u2018remotely a corrupt country\u2019. Is it?, 11 November).

It will include \u201cpeople, airlines, travel agencies and everyone involved in this illegal push of migrants against our borders\u201d, Borrell said.\nLukashenko has vowed to retaliate. \u201cThey\u2019re scaring us with sanctions,\u201d he told officials on Monday. \u201cWe will defend ourselves. We can not retreat.\u201d He did not announce specific measures.\nLukashenko had previously threatened to cut gas supplies to Europe via a pipeline from Russia. A Kremlin spokesperson on Monday said Vladimir Putin had expressed \u201cconfidence that this won\u2019t affect the transport of gas\u201d.\nThe EU decision was announced as a column of people converged on the Polish border for the second week running.\nVideo footage showed people walking out of a forest where they were encamped and making for the Ku\u017anica border crossing. The group was accompanied by Belarusian police in riot gear. When they reached the border, they were met by Polish riot police standing behind razor wire fencing. The standoff has continued into the evening with Poland deploying reinforcements to the border area.\nThe EU has already imposed four rounds of sanctions on the Belarusian authorities and senior officials over last year\u2019s disputed election and the brutal crackdown on peaceful protesters that followed.\nEU officials want to ensure the new sanctions list is legally watertight, to minimise the risk of being sued in the European court of justice. \u201cWe are all pushing to have this done yesterday, but the reality is that yesterday will probably come in two weeks,\u201d said one diplomat ahead of the meeting.\nDiplomats are also discussing tightening economic sanctions against Belarus by extending restrictions that already target the tobacco and potash industries \u2013 both vital sources of revenue for Lukashenko.\n\u201cWe are far from the end of the spiral of sanctions,\u201d said Germany\u2019s foreign minister, Heiko Maas. The Belarus flag carrier, Belavia, is among the airlines likely to be targeted and Maas called on other companies to follow the example of Turkish Airlines by restricting flights to Belarus\u2019s capital.\n\u201cThose that don\u2019t must expect tough sanctions. The situation is so dramatic that I can no longer rule out the denial of overflight rights or landing permission in the European area,\u201d he said.\nThe sanctions list is thought unlikely to feature the Russian airline Aeroflot, although Poland and Lithuania have said they hold the Russian president responsible for the border crisis. \u201cHe [Putin] is driving this crisis together with Mr Lukashenko politically, that\u2019s for certain,\u201d Lithuania\u2019s foreign minister, Gabrielius Landsbergis, told reporters.\n\u201cRussia is using this crisis to destabilise the EU,\u201d he added, describing migration as one of the most sensitive topics for the EU. \u201cIt\u2019s an excellent weapon against us. And if we are unable to make a decision, then you can probably say \u2018look, the EU is ineffective\u2019 and that builds up new fires inside the EU.\u201d\nWith reports of Russian troops massing near Russia\u2019s border with Ukraine, Landsbergis suggested the Kremlin could be preparing an attack. \u201cIt is very likely that Ukraine could be attacked while we are dealing with the situation on the Polish, Lithuanian and Belarusian border,\u201d he said. Belarus could also be attacked and Belarusian border guards replaced with Russian FSB agents, under a pretext of deeper cooperation between the two countries, Landsbergis claimed.\nLandsbergis said Lithuania would be ready to help with any UN-organised repatriation of people to the Middle East, but ruled out return flights from his country.\nAn Iraqi official on Sunday announced that the country would organise its first repatriation flight for people trapped on the border between Belarus and Poland. The flight would leave on Thursday from Minsk.\nThe official did not say how many people the flight would transport to Iraq. According to an Iraqi government tally, 571 of its citizens have requested \u201cvoluntary\u201d repatriation, the official said.\nThe number of Iraqis on the Belarus-Poland border is believed to be far higher. One Iraqi Kurdish official last week estimated that there were as many as 8,000 people from just that region at the border.\nOn Monday, Lukashenko said many of those camped out on the border with Poland would be unwilling to return to Iraq.\n\u201cWe\u2019re ready \u2026 to put them on planes that will carry them back home,\u201d said Lukashenko in televised remarks to government officials. \u201cBut these are people who, it must be said, are very stubborn: Nobody wants to go back. And it\u2019s clear why: they have nowhere to go back to.\u201d\nEU officials have held talks with countries in the Middle East to slow the flow of people, many from Iraq and Syria, to the border with Europe. But that will not solve the question of what to do with the thousands already trapped, in many cases denied entry to both Poland and back into Belarus.\nDiplomats estimate between 10,000 and 20,000 people face increasingly harsh conditions in the border area as temperatures plummet.\nIn a highly unlikely scenario, Lukashenko also suggested that Belarus would be ready to transport people directly to Germany. \u201cIf the Poles don\u2019t give us a humanitarian corridor, then we can take them to Munich on Belavia,\u201d he said.",

These events warrant discussions between the parties of the agreement first signed in 2018.\u201d\nThe UN said it was \u201cready to facilitate such discussions\u201d. The UN special envoy Hans Grundberg expressed his concern at the fighting, and called for de-escalation.\nThe 2018 Hodeidah agreement, negotiated in Stockholm, was at the time seen as the first step to a wider peace in Yemen, but no detailed agreement was ever made on the mutual withdrawal of Houthi and UN backed Yemen government troops in the port leading to an impasse.\n700 families (approximately 4,900 people) were displaced to Khokha, over 100 kilometres (60 miles) south of Hodeidah, \u201cwhile 184 other families (about 1,300 people) were displaced further south to the Red Sea coastal town of Mokha\u201d, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said, citing Yemeni government sources.\nThe Emirati-backed commander of Yemeni National Resistance forces, Tareq Saleh, had initiated the withdrawal in the middle of last week, saying it had been a mistake to expend troops on maintaining a defensive frontline with no ability to fight due to previously signed peace agreements.\nAmid anger at the retreat in some quarters considering the previous sacrifices that had been made to hold the port, the Saudi-led coalition of military forces in Yemen insisted the withdrawal was orderly and part of a considered military strategy.\nThe withdrawal means the road is now open between the port and the Houthi held Yemen capital Sana\u2019a, potentially facilitating the flow of aid. It is not clear if the withdrawal is a precursor to a wider Saudi withdrawal designed to bring about a wider ceasefire and peace talks.",

The record wholesale prices have forced almost 20 energy suppliers to go bust since the start of September, , with more failures expected in the coming weeks.\n\u201cThe very high wholesale prices have caused significant distress even before winter begins,\u201d said Anna Moss, head of consumer markets at Cornwall Insight, which compiled the data. \u201cHow suppliers fare is in the hands of wholesale trading parties, and how suppliers can manage their costs through the winter months ahead.\u201d\nOn Monday, gas-fired power plants were producing nearly 55% of electricity needs, up from a more typical level of 40%, while the rapidly disappearing coal sector accounted for about 3%.\nWind farms accounted for just 4%, a fraction of the average of 21% supplied over the last year, according to data from the Drax Electric Insights website.\nDemand for energy has rocketed as economies reopen following the coronavirus pandemic, with wholesale prices also under pressure due to lower supplies from Russia to western Europe.\nWhile natural gas prices have climbed steeply, the UK\u2019s price cap on energy bills stops companies from immediately passing those costs on to their customers.\nLast month, Cornwall Insight released a report estimating that energy bills could rise by as much as 30% from 1 April, when industry regulator Ofgem is set to raise the price cap to contain the crisis engulfing suppliers.\n This article was amended on 16 November 2021 to remove mention of a 55-day run of coal-free power generation.

Police had initially claimed Monson had died of a drugs overdose.\nJudge Eric Ogola issued the verdicts in Mombasa at the end of a high-profile case that has shone a spotlight on police brutality in the east African country. The victim\u2019s mother, Hilary Monson, welcomed the verdicts.\n\u201cThis should send a strong message to the Kenyan police force to have respect for human life,\u201d she told the court.\nThe four police officers, Naftali Chege, Charles Wangombe Munyiri, Baraka Buluma and John Pamba, received prison sentences of 48 years in total. They all hung their heads after the verdict was announced, while one cried quietly, Reuters reported.\nChege was sentenced to 15 years in jail, five of which were suspended. Munyiri was sentenced to 12 years, six of which were suspended. Buluma was given nine years, five of which were suspended, and Pamba was sentenced to 12 years, six of them suspended.\nMonson\u2019s mother told journalists after the sentencing: \u201cI just feel like after waiting for 10 years, the sentence given to the accused persons isn\u2019t enough for a mother who lost her child in such a brutal manner.\u201d\nMonson, 28, was found dead after being arrested in May 2012 for allegedly smoking cannabis during a night out in Diani, near Mombasa, on Kenya\u2019s Indian Ocean coast.\nBut toxicology reports showed later Monson had no drugs in his system at the time.\n\u201cThe drugs were planted on the deceased after his death as a cover-up,\u201d said Ogola, adding that Monson was in perfect health before his arrival at the station and that he was \u201cbrutally tortured\u201d while there.\nHe added that those who brutally tortured Monson were known to the four police officers, but that their identities could not be confirmed by the court because of \u201cthe code of silence in the police force\u201d.\n\u201cI am satisfied that the death of the deceased was caused through unlawful omission on the part of the accused persons for failing to seek medical care for the deceased in good time,\u201d Ogola said.\nMonson was the son of Nicholas, the 12th Lord Monson, and heir to a family estate in Lincolnshire in eastern England. Nicholas Monson attended the sentencing in court and nodded slowly as the verdicts were announced.\n\u201cI think the verdict could have been stronger, but I know obviously the suspects will face some punishment in jail,\u201d he said.\nKenyan police face frequent accusations of brutality and extrajudicial killings from civilians and rights groups, but officers are rarely charged and almost never convicted.\nThe Independent Policing Oversight Authority was established in 2011 to investigate deaths and serious injuries caused by police action and has received millions of dollars in foreign funding.\nThe organisation has only secured 13 convictions against police officers, despite Kenyans having filed thousands of complaints against police since its creation.",

        "content": "England are preparing for Saturday\u2019s World Cup final rematch against South Africa without their captain Owen Farrell and facing a front-row crisis after Eddie Jones was dealt a huge double injury blow on Monday.\nBoth Farrell and Jamie George have been ruled out with ankle and knee injuries respectively, leaving Jones without his chief lieutenant and severely depleted front-row ranks with South Africa, by contrast, bringing their infamous \u201cBomb Squad\u201d to Twickenham.\nBoth players are due to see specialists this week after suffering their injuries during last weekend\u2019s 32-15 win over Australia, with Farrell limping off in considerable pain in the second half. Having had to isolate and miss the victory over Tonga earlier this month, the latest blow rounds off a miserable autumn for the 30-year-old.\nHis absence suggests Jones will revert to a centre pairing of Manu Tuilagi and Henry Slade, with Marcus Smith continuing at fly-half, but Farrell\u2019s influence on the side will be sorely missed. It will be only the 10th match in Jones\u2019s reign in which Farrell has not appeared and without him Courtney Lawes is the favourite for the captaincy, having assumed the role against Tonga.\nGeorge\u2019s absence, meanwhile, makes Jones\u2019s front-row problem all the more acute. Jamie Blamire, who has scored six tries in his four England appearances, is now in line for the No 2 jersey but the 23-year-old has made just three Premiership starts. Jack Singleton, who has three replacement appearances for England, has been called into the squad while the uncapped Nic Dolly could also provide hooker cover against the Springboks.\nJones also has problems at loosehead prop after Ellis Genge and Joe Marler contracted Covid-19 last week, forcing both players into isolation and out of the Australia match. Genge cannot face South Africa but Marler is due to resume training on Friday just 24 hours before England host the Springboks. The 21-year-old Bevan Rodd, who made his debut against the Wallabies, is standing by for another start while Jones has added the uncapped Harry Elrington of Gloucester to his squad to provide cover along with Trevor Davison.\nTellingly, however, Mako Vunipola, who has 67 England caps and a further nine Test appearances for the British & Irish Lions, has not been called upon. The 30-year-old, along with brother Billy, has been omitted from the squad this season and Jones made clear last week that he was taking the side in a different direction with the 2023 World Cup in mind.\nThe upshot is that Jones must select an understrength front row against one of the most powerful scrummaging sides in the world. England were outgunned in that department in the 2019 World Cup final, after losing Kyle Sinckler to a head injury in the third minute, and ultimately succumbed 32-12 in Yokohama.\nHighlighting the difference in experience, South Africa have started Ox Nch\u00e9, Bongi Mbonambi and Trevor Nyakane in their two autumn victories against Wales and Scotland before replacing all three simultaneously with the equally formidable Steven Kitshoff, Malcolm Marx and Vincent Koch either at half-time or soon after. The tactic has led to the Springboks reinforcements earning their \u201cBomb Squad\u201d nickname.\n\u201cWe work as two front rows, we work hard in training,\u201d said Kitshoff. \u201cThey are a great fun, they bring a lot of intensity in that first half, they go flat out every scrum, it\u2019s do or die, every scrum is a massive battle. For us it\u2019s about trying to stay on a par with them and even try and lift the intensity a little bit if we can.\n\u201cBeing part of the Bomb Squad, there\u2019s a lot of pride but it\u2019s the team\u2019s plan and we\u2019re willing to just execute whatever is best for the team because the Springboks team comes first. We know our role, we know what we need to do, everything is planned out during the week and we understand our job and responsibility and we give it everything we can.\u201d\nMeanwhile, England\u2019s Maro Itoje has been named as one of the four nominees for World Rugby\u2019s player of the year but the Springboks are conspicuously absent from the shortlist. Itoje is joined by the Australian duo Samu Kerevi and Michael Hooper as well as France\u2019s scrum-half Antoine Dupont despite South Africa\u2019s series win over the Lions and victory over the All Blacks in the Rugby Championship. Jacques Nienaber is also missing from the coach of the year shortlist. Elsewhere, Ireland will face Argentina this weekend without their captain Johnny Sexton who suffered an ankle and knee injury against New Zealand and is set to be sidelined for up to six weeks.",

China has reported 21 human infections with the H5N6 subtype of avian influenza so far this year, more than in the whole of 2020.\nSouth Korea reported an outbreak at a farm of around 770,000 poultry in Chungcheongbuk-do, the OIE said on Monday, citing a report from the South Korean authorities. All animals were slaughtered.\nAlso in Asia, Japan reported its first outbreak of the 2021 winter season, at a poultry farm in the north-east of the country, the OIE said, confirming a statement last week by Japan\u2019s agriculture ministry. The serotype in this outbreak was H5N8.\nIn Europe, Norway reported an H5N1 bird flu outbreak in the Rogaland region in a flock of 7,000 birds, the OIE said.\nBird flu circulates naturally among wild birds, and when they migrate to the UK from mainland Europe in winter the disease can be spread to poultry and other captive birds.\nThe Belgian government put the country on increased risk for bird flu, ordering poultry to be kept indoors as of Monday, after a highly pathogenic variant of bird flu was identified in a wild goose near Antwerp.\nThis followed a similar move in neighbouring France earlier this month and in the Netherlands in October.\nEarlier this month, a bird flu prevention zone was declared across Great Britain, legally requiring all bird keepers to follow strict biosecurity measures after a flock of poultry was culled near Dundee in Scotland in response to a bird flu outbreak.\nBird flu can affect humans in rare cases if people touch infected birds, their droppings or bedding, or while preparing infected poultry for cooking.",

        "content": "Kensington and Sefton Park residents relate \u2018very, very frightening\u2019 scenes of bomb squad searches and evacuation\nSharon Cullen has lived in Boaler Street in Kensington, Liverpool for 18 years and knows many of her neighbours. But the only detail she could recall of the residents of 2 Sutcliffe Street, which backs on to her house, was that one young man used to spend hours on a PC, highlighted in a window with no curtains or blinds.\nThe address, a red painted brick end-of-terrace, with a bay window, has been surrounded by police since early afternoon on Sunday, when they eventually made three arrests, and a further one on Monday morning.\nCullen said that the streets were \u201cinundated with police\u201d about 2.30 on Sunday. Then it was \u201carmed response and the bomb squad\u201d, she said. She could see armed officers on ladders in the alleyway behind her house, which also runs along the back of Sutcliffe Road.\nThree men in their twenties were arrested in the early evening, and Cullen and her family were told that police would disperse within hours but that they should remain inside and not leave.\nHowever, about 9.45pm, they heard a knock at the door. \u201cThey said we had to evacuate because whatever was in the property would take the whole block out\u201d. Cullen, her husband and daughter scooped up her two-year-old grandson and the dog, grabbed their coats and left.\n\u201cIt was just horrendous, it very, very frightening\u201d, she added.\nKeith Ford, who lives a couple of doors down from the property, saw two of the arrests from his front window, until he was also asked to leave his house about 6.30pm. Ford, a production operative in a factory, said he thought the inhabitants had only moved in the last month or so.\n\u201cThey kept themselves to themselves\u201d, he said.\nNext door to the Sutcliffe Street address is the Sir Walter Raleigh pub, which was locked down with punters inside during the afternoon. It remained shut on Monday, alongside several boarded up shops and businesses. Kensington, or Kenny as it is known locally, is one of Liverpool\u2019s most deprived boroughs. It was home to the cockle pickers who died in the 2004 Morecambe Bay tragedy, who lived in cramped conditions of up to 10 to a room.\nA couple of miles away, in the Sefton Park area of the city, is Rutland Avenue \u2013 the address where taxi driver David Perry picked up the passenger on Sunday before the car exploded outside the hospital. Police have \u201cattributed\u201d the taxi passenger to both the addresses, but remain uncertain where he lived. The one thing both properties have in common is that residents believe they were houses in multiple occupation (HMO).\nLocated in one of Liverpool\u2019s oldest suburbs with a bohemian reputation, the house where police are understood to have seized \u201csignificant items\u201d related to the homemade bomb sits on one of a series of sought-after streets known as \u201cthe Avenues\u201d.\nWithin hours of the explosion on Sunday, it was crawling with police cars, vans and ambulances. Several of the neighbours who were evacuated on Sunday night were put up in hotels by Liverpool council. Some local residents have been told they will not return to their homes on Monday night.\nThe entire street remained cordoned off on Monday and local residents have not been able to leave, which means police needed to deliver one man\u2019s grocery shopping to his door as the supermarket\u2019s van could not get down the street.\nA taxi driver working for Delta Taxis, the same company the driver injured in the blast was employed by, said many drivers in the city were feeling wary.\n\u201cI can\u2019t see any taxi drivers accepting fares from that area at the moment. Being a taxi driver isn\u2019t the safest job sometimes and at the moment you are going to be concerned picking people up,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe do have to worry about our safety and nobody wants that happening to them. I\u2019ve been looking closely at what people are wearing getting into the cab.\u201d\nKate O\u2019Brien Fay, a writer who lives a couple of streets away, said that it was a \u201cvibrant, multicultural\u201d area, including older people, young families as well as some students. \u201cI\u2019ve never, ever felt concerned or a threat of anything. There\u2019s never been a suspicion of it. It\u2019s the most harmonious place,\u201d she said.\nAlthough residents remain shocked, \u201cpeople round here are going to really hold off on a judgment\u201d, O\u2019Brien Fay said. \u201cThey\u2019re not the type to sensationalise or jump to conclusions\u201d.",

        "content": "Well graced, well spoken and (usually) well dressed on the stage, Clifford Rose, who has died aged 92, was a founder member of the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1960 and one of its most prominent \u201csecond leads\u201d over many seasons.\nHe initially spent nine years with the company, appearing in such landmark productions as Michael Elliott\u2019s As You Like It, with Vanessa Redgrave; the Wars of the Roses, with Peggy Ashcroft, Donald Sinden, Janet Suzman and Ian Holm; Peter Brook\u2019s King Lear, with Paul Scofield; and Brook\u2019s Marat/Sade, with Glenda Jackson and Patrick Magee, in which he played the asylum director, a role he reprised at the National Theatre in 1997.\nHe took an unofficial RSC \u201csabbatical\u201d in the 1970s when he became a familiar face on television, notably in three series of Secret Army, playing a Gestapo officer, Standartenf\u00fchrer Ludwig Kessler, investigating an escape plan for British pilots in occupied Belgium; this yielded, in 1981, a \u201cname-above-the-title\u201d six-part serial, Kessler, now a wealthy industrialist and wanted war criminal in a contemporary setting.\nFor a time, and before returning to the RSC, he was a household face, reaching even larger audiences in the 1981 Doctor Who story Warriors\u2019 Gate, as the maverick starship trooper Captain Rorvik, who is transporting the enslaved, time-sensitive Tharils, a pride of leonine aliens \u2013 until the fourth Doctor, Tom Baker, intervenes.\nEven here, there was something Teutonic about Rose\u2019s uniform and epaulettes. This was an odd development for a British \u201cheart of oak\u201d actor, whose clean-cut features, classic haircut and affable but not invulnerable demeanour brought to mind the abdicating Edward VIII, the Duke of Windsor, not least when he played the duke\u2019s father, George V, in a 2005 television film, Wallis and Edward.\nClifford \u2013 the name was that of a Herefordshire village adjacent to his birthplace, Hamnish \u2013 was the eldest son of Percival Rose, a gentleman farmer and lay preacher, and his wife, Violet (nee Pratt), who ran the local volunteer nurses service during the war. He was educated at the King\u2019s school, Worcester, and at King\u2019s College London, where he took a degree in English and developed his passion for the stage.\nOn graduating, he auditioned for the Elizabethan theatre company, a touring set-up whose directors included John Barton and Peter Hall. They recruited him a few years later at the RSC. He made a London debut in Shakespeare (Julius Caesar and Henry V) at the Westminster theatre in 1953 and spent the next few years in weekly and fortnightly rep, and in a touring company, the Penguin Players, where he met his wife, also an actor (and teacher), Celia Ryder.\nWhat he learned from Barton about Shakespearean verse, said Rose, stayed with him all his life. In those early RSC years he was an imposing Priam in Barton\u2019s first version of his favourite play, Troilus and Cressida (Holm and Dorothy Tutin; Peter O\u2019Toole as Thersites); King Duncan in the Macbeth of Eric Porter and Irene Worth; and Dromio of Ephesus in the Clifford Williams production of The Comedy of Errors in 1962, hailed by Kenneth Tynan as defining the birth of a great new ensemble company. That tumultuously hilarious show was in the repertoire for several years.\nRose had made a television debut in 1959 as Second Dandy in Hilda Lessways, adapted in six parts from Arnold Bennett\u2019s Clayhanger novels, with Judi Dench and Eileen Atkins. From the RSC, apart from his Kessler saga, which occupied five years of his working life, he sprang prominently into several of the BBC\u2019s biggest 1970s series: Jean-Paul Sartre\u2019s The Roads to Freedom, as the brother of lead actor Michael Bryant; Simon Raven\u2019s blockbuster adaptation of Anthony Trollope\u2019s The Pallisers, as Quintus Slide, the editor of a scandal sheet; and Richard Llewellyn\u2019s How Green Was My Valley, starring Stanley Baker and Si\u00e2n Phillips, as the teacher Mr Jonas, given a revenge corporal punishment lesson \u2013 with fists \u2013 in front of his own class.\nHall cast him in Work is a Four-Letter Word (1968), a film version of Henry Livings\u2019s Eh?, which had been presented on stage by the RSC in 1964, alongside other RSC alumni David Warner, Elizabeth Spriggs and Alan Howard \u2026 and Cilla Black.\nAnd in the 1980s Rose cropped up in some interesting, if less than outstanding, movies such as The Wall (1982) about the uprising in the Warsaw Ghetto; as a magistrate in Terry on the Fence (1985), about \u201cmixed-up\u201d teenagers; and as a judge in Mike Newell\u2019s The Good Father (1985), written by Christopher Hampton and starring Anthony Hopkins. He always worked, as they say, with \u201cthe quality\u201d.\nHis return to the RSC in 1989 \u2013 he became an associate, and an honorary associate, of the company \u2013 led to performances as fraternal dukes, good and bad, in As You Like It; the Ghost of Hamlet\u2019s father in Kenneth Branagh\u2019s electrifying non-princely interpretation; a dignified and involving Antonio in a modern-dress Merchant of Venice; and the Archbishop of York in Henry IV. In Shakespeare outside the RSC, he most enjoyed playing Polonius \u2013 \u201coutstanding as an icy paterfamilias and court fixer\u201d said Nicholas de Jongh \u2013 to Michael Maloney\u2019s spring-heeled Hamlet at Greenwich in 1996.\nFor the fourth and final time he donned swastikas in the million-dollar television miniseries War and Remembrance, starring Robert Mitchum and Jane Seymour, covering the US involvement in the war from Pearl Harbor through to Hiroshima. He played Hans Kammler, the engineer who supervised the construction of the Nazi concentration camps and then disappeared off the face of the earth. Closer to home, he was Judge Critchley in four episodes of Alan Bleasdale\u2019s politically ambitious and controversial GBH (1991), starring Robert Lindsay, Lindsay Duncan and Michael Palin, for Channel 4.\nOn his third reincarnation at the RSC, he played a notable double as the Earl of Worcester and the Lord Chief Justice in Henry IV, directed by Michael Attenborough in 2000, and the Duke of Venice in Othello in 2004. And, in 2008, he was a slinky high court judge in Michael Grandage\u2019s superb Donmar Warehouse revival of Enid Bagnold\u2019s The Chalk Garden \u2013 with Margaret Tyzack, Penelope Wilton and the sensational newcomer Felicity Jones \u2013 for which he won the Clarence Derwent award as best supporting actor.\nThat was his last major stage appearance. On film, he played nice cameos in 2011, in the fourth of the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, On Stranger Tides (in a neat scene with Johnny Depp, he plays bailiff to Depp\u2019s \u201cpretend\u201d judge), and in Phyllida Lloyd\u2019s underrated The Iron Lady, with Meryl Streep as the best ever Mrs Thatcher, Jim Broadbent her gobsmacked loyal husband, Denis.\nHe continued doing recitals by invitation until last year, having signed off as the Dean of Windsor in The Crown in 2019, with Olivia Colman on the throne. He and Celia moved back to Stratford-upon-Avon 20 years ago, and he continued to follow the RSC with interest.\nCelia died in 2012. He is survived by his children, Rosalind and Duncan, his grandson, Charlie, and his brother Bob. His younger brother, David, also an actor, predeceased him.\n John Clifford Rose, actor, born 24 October 1929; died 6 November 2021\n This article was amended on 16 November 2021. Clifford Rose\u2019s appearance in The Crown came in 2019 rather than 2011.",

        "content": "Australia are three points off group leaders Saudi Arabia and just one point ahead of Japan in their bid to reach Qatar\n\u201cIt\u2019s in our hands.\u201d The phrase has become a sort of unofficial aphorism for Socceroos staff and players during this World Cup qualifying campaign. It was one employed throughout the previous phase of qualifying, when Australia kept a perfect record of eight wins, scoring 28 goals and conceding two. And it was used again by coach Graham Arnold after Thursday\u2019s stalemate with Saudi Arabia.\nGiven his side still sit second in Group B \u2013 the top two automatically make Qatar 2022 \u2013 three points behind leaders Saudi Arabia with five matches to play, it remains true today. True in a general sense, but on the Richter scale of tight grips they probably rate about a six. A win over the Saudis would have made life easier, as would have a point against Japan who, courtesy of their win over Australia last month, are only one point behind them in third.\nThe margin for error has shrunk, making Wednesday morning\u2019s tie with China more crucial than it may otherwise have been. A blunder in the United Arab Emirates would allow Japan to climb past them with a win over Oman (fourth on seven points) on Wednesday, while Saudi Arabia can lengthen their lead by beating last-placed Vietnam on Tuesday night.\n\u201cIt is tight, but it\u2019s the last phase of qualifying for a World Cup,\u201d said midfielder James Jeggo, who made his 10th international cap in a full match against the Green Falcons. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of good teams, it\u2019s very competitive. It\u2019s always been like that in Asia. We know what\u2019s at stake.\u201d\nAll of that said, the Socceroos should account for China with relative ease, having seen off the fourth-placed nation 3-0 in September. That was a home match but was, because of Covid restrictions, played on neutral territory in Doha. This one will be so for China, in the city of Sharjah.\nTheoretically this fixture should mark a return to normality for a team who, in this qualifying cycle, have swept aside every Asian minnow in their path en route to a world-record 11 successive wins. The by-product of that success has been a lack of opposition with an ability to truly test them. Japan and Saudi filled this void, and in doing so highlight previously concealed vulnerabilities, particularly in attack despite periods of clear forward momentum.\nDefensively, Arnold will be without a key player in Harry Souttar, who was stretchered off the field at CommBank Stadium on Thursday with a knee injury was confirmed on Monday to have torn his ACL. The injury will sideline the towering Stoke City centre-back for the remainder of the qualifying campaign and even put him in doubt for the World Cup, should Australia qualify.\n\u201cObviously it\u2019s a loss, losing Harry,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cBut what can you do? You\u2019ve just got to get on with it and be positive with the players that we\u2019ve got and move forward \u2026 it\u2019s a setback, he understands that, but he knows that it\u2019s going to make him stronger in the long-run and make him mentally tougher. As I said to him, \u2018you will be at the World Cup with us. Get yourself ready and get yourself fit.\u2019\u201d\nIn the meantime, it renders the fitness of Trent Sainsbury all the more important. Sainsbury played the full 90 minutes against Saudi Arabia but will have to prove his fitness after pulling up with a sore hamstring.\n\u201cMilos has come back in very good condition. He plays at Red Star [Belgrade], he\u2019s at a very successful club in a very good competition,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cWe saw Serbia last night beating Portugal, that just shows you the type of players that they\u2019re developing and what they\u2019ve got in their country and Milos is playing there every week and doing well. I\u2019ve got the utmost respect and trust in Milos that he will do a great job for us.\u201d\nHe will have the help of defenders Ryan McGowan and Bailey Wright, who were called up to replace Souttar at the expense of Andrew Nabbout, against a China team with one win from their five matches played.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of problems at the moment in Chinese football,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cThey\u2019re having to play all their games away from home, which is not far off what\u2019s happened with us. At times, that can build camaraderie and we\u2019ve just got to make sure we get our performance right ... make sure you\u2019re mentally prepared.\u201d\nAt the halfway point of this phase, World Cup qualification is in Australia\u2019s hands. But with games against Saudi Arabia and Japan still to come, they must keep it in their grasp.",

        "content": "Jens Stoltenberg says large Russian military buildup has been seen near Ukraine border\nThe Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has cautioned Moscow against \u201cany further provocation or aggressive actions\u201d following warnings by US officials that Russia could be preparing to a launch a winter offensive in Ukraine.\nThe Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said last week that Russia had amassed nearly 100,000 soldiers near Ukraine\u2019s border, as Washington warned that Moscow may be \u201cattempting to rehash\u201d its 2014 invasion.\n\u201cWe have seen large and unusual concentrations of Russian forces close to Ukraine\u2019s borders,\u201d Stoltenberg said on Monday. \u201cNato remains vigilant \u2026 Any further provocation or aggressive actions by Russia would be of serious concern. We call on Russia to be transparent about its military activities.\u201d\nStoltenberg\u2019s remarks came at a meeting with the Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, at Nato headquarters in Brussels, where the two discussed \u201cthe security situation in and around Ukraine\u201d.\n\u201cWe have to be clear-eyed,\u201d Stoltenberg said. \u201cWe need to be realistic about the challenges we face. And what we see is a significant, large Russian military buildup.\u201d\nSatellite imagery and videos uploaded to social media have shown tanks, artillery and short-range ballistic missiles on the move in the border regions of Ukraine and Belarus since late last month.\nSome of that weaponry was moved to the region earlier this year during a large-scale buildup that set alarm bells ringing in the west. But new rail transports of military hardware have been spotted in southern Russia and from as far away as Russia\u2019s Urals region, as well as on the Crimean peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014.\nWhile Stoltenberg said he did not want to speculate about the intentions of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, he called the situation \u201cdangerous\u201d and said it would allow Russia to launch offensive operations at short notice.\nAnalysts have noted that a previous Russian offensive into Ukraine against the city of Debaltseve in 2015 was also launched in winter, when the lower temperatures make it easier to transport armour and other heavy weaponry.\nBritish prime minister Boris Johnson argued on Monday that the west may soon have to stop relying on Russian oil and gas if it wants to stand against aggression towards Ukraine.\nIn a warning to European countries that are heavily dependent on Russian gas in particular, the prime minister signalled he believed Putin could be serious about restricting supplies from pipelines that run through eastern Europe if the west signalled its intention to defend Ukraine.\nSpeaking at the Lord Mayor\u2019s banquet in London, Johnson said: \u201cWhen our Polish friends asked for our help to deal with a contrived crisis on their border with Belarus, we were quick to respond. And we hope that our friends may recognise that a choice is shortly coming between mainlining ever more Russian hydrocarbons in giant new pipelines and sticking up for Ukraine and championing the cause of peace and stability, let me put it that way.\u201d\nThe US president, Joe Biden, dispatched the CIA director, Bill Burns, to Moscow this month to warn Putin that the US was watching the buildup closely, US media have reported.\n\u201cI hope the whole world can now clearly see who really wants peace and who is concentrating nearly 100,000 soldiers at our border,\u201d Zelenskiy said in a speech last week.\nRussia meanwhile has denied that it has any plans to launch offensive operations against Ukraine.\nPutin this weekend complained about Ukraine\u2019s use of Turkish-made Bayraktar TB2 drone strikes in Donbass, saying that they violated a 2015 ceasefire agreement. And top Russian military officials have accused Nato of a buildup in Europe and in the Black Sea.\nThe Russian military movements come as tensions increase over the migration crisis on Belarus\u2019s border with the European Union. Belarus has warned that any conflict could draw in Russia as the two countries are allies and jointly defend the country\u2019s borders with Nato.\nMoscow last week also sent nuclear-capable bombers and paratroopers on training missions to Belarus\u2019s western borders with Poland and Lithuania as Moscow and Minsk held joint exercises.\nLithuania\u2019s foreign minister, Gabrielius Landsbergis, also suggested the Kremlin could be using the Belarus border crisis as a smokescreen to prepare an attack.\n\u201cIt is very likely that Ukraine could be attacked while we are dealing with the situation on the Polish, Lithuanian and Belarusian border,\u201d he said.\nHe added that the buildup was \u201cactually the same distance from the border of Belarus and the same distance to the border of Ukraine, so I think that what Putin might be playing is that we don\u2019t have an answer [are kept guessing] to who is under attack\u201d.",

        "content": "The Phoenix Islands Protected Area is about the size of California and has been fully closed to commercial fishing since 2015\nThe Kiribati government has announced it will open up one of the world\u2019s largest marine protected areas to commercial fishing, citing economic benefits to its people.\nThe Phoenix Islands Protected Area (PIPA) spans 408,250 sq km (157,626 sq miles) \u2013 an area about the size of California \u2013 and was created in 2006 with the entire area declared a \u201cno-take\u201d zone in 2015, meaning that commercial fishing is forbidden.\nKiribati, a collection of islands in the central Pacific and which has an EEZ larger than the size of India, catches 700,000 tonnes a year of tuna. More tuna is caught in Kiribati\u2019s waters than in the waters of any other nation in the world.\nIn a press statement issued on Monday, the office of the president of the Kiribati government confirmed it was opening the protected zone citing the huge economic cost to Kiribati, a developing nation, of the ban.\n\u201cSimilar to any Government, our decisions, as we make them, put the livelihoods of our people at the fore and have been carefully considered and agreed to as a Government,\u201d it said.\n\u201cOur decision as a sovereign country and Government is people-centric and commensurate with holistic options for marine protection and management, economic diversification, sustainable tourism and fisheries, to promote the growth of Kiribati\u2019s blue economy, and uplift the lives of all I-Kiribati.\u201d\nDr Richard Jeo, Conservation International\u2019s Asia-Pacific field division senior vice president, said that it was their \u201cunderstanding that this proposal has not yet been introduced to Kiribati\u2019s parliament.\u201d\n\u201cIt would need to be formally approved by parliament before going into effect, which would likely not be until next year at the earliest. There is significant geopolitics at play in the Pacific region, and as a sovereign nation, Kiribati has the authority to decide on the future of PIPA.\u201d\nJeo said they remained hopeful that Kiribati would maintain PIPA\u2019s marine protected area designation and would choose \u201cto continue as a global conservation leader, standing lockstep with a global community that is committed to protecting 30% of land and sea by 2030.\u201d\nBut the Kiribati government said that when it established PIPA it was assured it would be able to recoup the revenues lost from fishing licences, which make up more than 70% of Kiribati\u2019s total annual revenue, but that this had not eventuated.\nThe government said years after PIPA\u2019s inception it was not sufficient to meet the present need of the people of Kiribati and the country\u2019s future development needs.\nThe statement also reiterated the Kiribati government\u2019s commitment to conservation efforts by investing in marine and biodiversity protection and promoting climate resilience.\nThe government said that since PIPA\u2019s closure to commercial fishing, there had been an 8% decline in demand for fishing in Kiribati\u2019s EEZ translating to a loss in revenue of up to USD$146m from 2015 to the present.\nFormer president Anote Tong, who was responsible for overseeing the creation of PIPA, expressed his strong disappointment with the announcement, but said the proper process, which involves a parliamentary vote on opening up PIPA to fishing, still had to be observed.\n\u201cI\u2019m very, very disappointed,\u201d he said. \u201cI never expected that this would happen. And this was precisely the reason that we put it into legislation. Because it had to be something that would remain regardless of any political changes.\u201d",

More must be done to stop the dangerous crossings. They agreed to accelerate the delivery of the commitments made in the joint agreement of July 2021 to deliver on their joint determination to prevent 100% of crossings and make this deadly route unviable,\u201d the statement said.\nThe two ministers discussed a range of additional steps, alongside additional technical solutions to tackle organised crime groups and respond to the escalating issue, the statement added.\n\u201cIt was agreed that the joint technical working group will meet imminently with a view to permitting the use of new technology as rapidly as possible. The two ministers also committed to reinforcing intelligence sharing and police cooperation,\u201d it said.\nDowning Street had called on the French government to do more to stem the number of people travelling across the Channel in small boats amid a growing diplomatic row over who bears greater responsibility.\nIt came after an intervention from Darmanin, who claimed that his country is being treated like a \u201cpunchbag\u201d by a UK government that has failed to sort out its unregulated labour market.\nOn Monday, the prime minister\u2019s official spokesperson pointed to the \u00a354m that the UK government has paid to France to beef up its patrols on its northern coastline, from which many boats are launched.\n\u201cWe are providing funding to the French to allow them to increase surveillance, to allow them to increase the police presence that is there to prevent these crossings taking place.\n\u201cThrough that investment we have seen stoppages increase, and that is to be welcomed, but clearly with the level of crossings we are seeing per day, more needs to be done,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt is clear that we need to keep working with our French counterparts to do more to prevent these crossings, which are putting lives at risk,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\u201cThat is why the home secretary is looking to speak to her counterpart to make those points and address this unexpected rise in illegal migrants arriving from France which we are seeing playing out in front of us.\u201d\nEarlier, Darmanin said it was the UK\u2019s inaction that encouraged people to attempt the perilous crossing.\n\u201cWhy do people go to Calais? It\u2019s to go to Great Britain. And why do they want to go to Great Britain? It\u2019s because the labour market largely works in Great Britain thanks to a large army or reserves \u2013 as Karl Marx said \u2013 of people in an irregular situation but who can work at a low cost, obviously,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not taking lessons from the British \u2026 they must stop using us as a punching bag for their domestic politics. We are neither their collaborators nor their assistants. The smugglers, who organise networks and exploit women and children \u2026 are very often themselves in Britain.\u201d\nDarmanin told CNews the British government needed to change its laws to discourage migrants being attracted to the UK.\n\u201cIf the British tightened up their legislation \u2013 they have started doing so but not gone far enough \u2013 people would no longer be in Calais or Dunkirk,\u201d he said.\nLast Thursday, an estimated 1,185 people crossed the Channel by boat, a record for crossings in a single day. Three people were feared drowned in the busy sea lane. More than 23,000 people have made the journey across the Channel to the UK by boat so far this year, a marked increase on the 8,400 in 2020. The British government has accused France of failing to control the situation.\nYoung children were carried ashore in Dover on Monday after more people risked death crossing the Channel. A toddler wrapped in a light blue hoodie looked around at border officials as he was carried in the arms of a woman.\nReports claimed that a jetski used to cross the Channel has been recovered at sea by the RNLI and towed ashore in Dungeness.\nThe French authorities have grown increasingly angry at anonymous Whitehall briefings claiming that Paris is failing to keep to their word and spend the UK\u2019s cash on stopping people from travelling to the UK.\nPatel said at the weekend that France \u201cmust stop 100% of boats\u201d attempting to cross, suggesting Monday\u2019s meeting between the two ministers would have been extremely tense.\nFrench police say while they are preventing more crossings, they cannot stop all attempts because there are too many migrants and the shoreline is too long to patrol around the clock.\nThey also point to international maritime law, which prevents an intervention once those travelling to the UK are in a boat on the water.\nClaire Millot, the general secretary of the Salam association, which helps migrants in the Calais coastal area, told French media: \u201cSince this summer, small boat crossings have increased enormously. There were very few drownings so word spread and attempts multiplied.\u201d\nShe said the arrival of winter and less favourable weather conditions could lead to more deaths. \u201cIt\u2019s about to change, we are very afraid that despite the winter, the crossings will continue and so will the tragedies,\u201d she said.",

        "content": "The signing of a $1.2tn infrastructure act was a much-needed win but Washington\u2019s deep divisions were all too apparent\n\u201cHere is what I know to be true, Mr President,\u201d Vice-President Kamala Harris said on Monday, as she addressed Joe Biden. \u201cYou are equal parts believer and builder. And because you are, we are all better off.\u201d\nBiden is a believer in the ability of the American people, US democracy and Democrats and Republicans to work together and get things done. It was the theory of his candidacy for president.\nBut his faith has been sorely tested since he took office.\nReality keeps mugging Biden and yet he comes back for more, his convictions apparently unshaken. He refuses to be disappointed in America. His reward came on Monday when he signed into law a bipartisan trillion-dollar bill to repair roads, bridges and other infrastructure.\nThe president told a gathering of about 800 mayors, governors and workers on the White House South Lawn: \u201cThe bill I\u2019m about to sign is proof that despite the cynics, Democrats and Republicans can come together and deliver results. We can do this. We can deliver real results for real people.\u201d\nOnly the harshest of cynics would deny him this victory lap for the biggest public works bill since former president Dwight Eisenhower created the interstate highway system in 1956. \u201cJoe! Joe! Joe!\u201d chanted supporters as the sun set, casting its light on him but leaving most of the crowd in the shade as chill winds blew.\nBut it did not take a cynic to notice the clues that Washington still has a long way to go to heal its deep, dysfunctional divisions and live up to Biden\u2019s idealism. This might be a new dawn of bipartisanship. Or it might be its last gasp.\nInfrastructure, after all, is a low bar to clear. Foreign visitors to the US are stunned to find the most powerful nation the world has ever known plagued by potholed roads, crumbling bridges and clapped-out airports. China and others are racing ahead. America had to act because it couldn\u2019t not act.\nSix years ago, when Congress last approved a significant renewal of federal highway and other transport programs, it was backed by nearly every Democrat and robust majorities of Republicans.\nThis time, the $1.2tn infrastructure bill cleared the Senate 69-13 with Republican support, but scraped through the House last week with just 13 Republican votes. And they have paid a political price.\nDonald Trump, the former president, lambasted them. Marjorie Taylor Greene, an extremist member of Congress, branded them \u201ctraitors\u201d while tweeting their names and office telephone numbers.\nCongressman Fred Upton of Michigan said his offices received dozens of threatening calls following his yes vote. That included one obscenity-laced rant in which the caller repeatedly called Upton a \u201ctraitor\u201d and expressed hope that he, his family and aides would die.\nIf the Maga (\u201cMake America Great Again\u201d) wing of the Republican party was hoping to intimidate party members so they would stay away from Biden\u2019s shindig, they appear to have succeeded. Only a sprinkling of congressional Republicans were present to hear this paean to bipartisanship.\nMitch McConnell, the Senate minority leader who voted for the bill, was notably not among them, apparently unwilling to enhance Biden\u2019s political victory (the president thanked him in his absence, all the same).\nInstead there was the Republican senator Rob Portman of Ohio, who is not running for re-election and so has nothing to fear from the vengeance of Maga world.\nBiden joked: \u201cSenator Rob Portman is really a hell of a good guy. I\u2019m not hurting you, Rob, because I know you\u2019re not running again.\u201d\nThis was not a Trumpian celebration of fireworks, military jets roaring overhead and tanks parked on the lawn. Nevertheless, the Rose Garden colonnades were bedecked with the Stars and Stripes and the flags of all 50 states were lined up at the south portico.\nPortman, Senator Kyrsten Sinema (neither wearing a coat despite the cold), the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, and the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, strode across the South Lawn as a fanfare played from a brass band.\nSinema, a centrist Arizona Democrat, told the gathering: \u201cHow many times have we heard that bipartisanship isn\u2019t possible any more or that important policy can only happen on a party line? Our legislation proves the opposite and the senators who negotiated this legislation show how to get things done.\u201d\nBut her prominent role summed up the ambiguity of the moment. Sinema has enraged many on the left by her enigmatic and intransigent approach to part two of Biden\u2019s agenda, known as Build Back Better, which proposes $1.75tn in social and environmental spending. Republicans are uniformly opposed.\nThat deadlock is not helping Biden\u2019s approval rating, hovering around the 40% mark despite jobs growth, nor doing much to dispel the fear that the rot has set in for good in the body politic.\nBut for one afternoon at least, Biden could be Biden, giving thanks to absent friends and reasserting his belief in America.\n\u201cI ran for president because the only way to move our country forward is through compromise and consensus,\u201d he said.",

Miroslav Palansk\u00fd, a TJN data scientist, said the figures represented \u201cthe tip of the iceberg\u201d and that actual losses from tax abuse were much higher.\nAccording to the annual snapshot, the tax revenues lost by lower-income countries would be enough to vaccinate 60% of their populations, bridging the gap in vaccination rates between poor countries and wealthier western nations.\nHowever, it found rich countries were responsible for facilitating 78% of global tax losses, and called on responsibility for setting international tax rules to be moved from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) \u2013 a club of 38 wealthy nations \u2013 to the UN.\nIt comes after the OECD brokered a deal between almost 140 nations to agree a minimum 15% global tax rate for corporations. However, the State of Tax Justice 2021 report said it was expected to recover only a fraction of revenues lost to tax havens and would redistribute most recovered taxes to rich OECD members instead of the countries where the taxes should have originally been paid.\nAlex Cobham, the chief executive of the TJN, said: \u201cAnother year of the pandemic, and another half-trillion dollars snatched by the wealthiest multinational corporations and individuals from public purses around the world. Tax can be our most powerful tool for tackling inequality but, instead, it\u2019s been made entirely optional for the super-rich.\n\u201cWe must reprogramme the global tax system to protect people\u2019s wellbeing and livelihoods over the desires of the wealthiest, or the cruel inequalities exposed by the pandemic will be locked in for good. The State of Tax Justice tells us exactly which countries are responsible for the tax abuse we all suffer. It\u2019s time they were held accountable.\u201d\nA UK government spokesperson said: \u201cWe\u2019ve led the world in its efforts to crack down on global tax abuse \u2013 most recently by helping to create a global minimum corporation tax and new tax rules for 2023 so the right tax is paid in the right places by the right firms.\n\u201cOn top of this, we have improved global transparency by driving up standards to help tax authorities find hidden incomes and assets.

The law change would mean 99 remained in jail. And in the Northern Territory all 16 of the kids currently in detention would remain there.\nThe National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Service labelled the announcement \u201cfutile and deceiving\u201d.\n\u201cThis announcement does little to better the lives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children, who make up a staggering 65% of the kids in the criminal legal system,\u201d NATSILS said.\n\u201cIt has been over three years since Attorneys General committed to exploring options to raise the age. Three years of inaction is damaging the lives and futures of our kids \u2013 and we are sick and tired of meaningless statements.\u201d\nAmnesty International Australia welcomed the commitment to raise the age of criminal responsibility, but said the age should be 14.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a kick in the guts to the kids languishing in detention and everyone who has campaigned for the chance for our kids to live happy and healthy lives free of the criminal justice system,\u201d Amnesty\u2019s Indigenous rights campaigner Maggie Munn said\nMunn said the UN\u2019s Committee on the Rights of the Child recommended 14 as the minimum age of criminal responsibility in 2019.\n\u201cAnd here we are two years later talking about raising the age to 12 \u2013 it\u2019s devastating the Attorneys-General think so little of our kids and their futures.\u201d\nThe Victorian Aboriginal Legal Service said it was \u201cnothing short of devastating\u201d for Aboriginal children.\n\u201cThat this country\u2019s leading legal officers choose to ignore human rights norms, indisputable medical evidence, and Aboriginal voices is shocking,\u201d said VALS\u2019s community justice leader Lee-Anne Carter, a Wiradjuri and Noongar woman.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t celebrate the Closing the Gap agreement and the establishment, in Victoria, of the first Australian truth and justice commission, while simultaneously filling prisons with Aboriginal children.\u201d\nThe Northern Territory had already committed to raising the age to 12 to reflect the recommendation of the Don Dale royal commission, but the ACT is the only jurisdiction to commit to raising the age to 14 in line with international standards set by the UN.\nIn NSW, Greens MP David Shoebridge has introduced a bill into parliament to raise the age to 14 and prevent any child under 16 from being locked up.\n\u201cAt ages 10 and 11 children are still losing their baby teeth, they don\u2019t have their pen licenses let alone drivers licenses,\u201d Shoebridge said.\n\u201cSome of these young people spend their first night away from their families in a prison cell\u201d.\n\u201cLocking young children up isn\u2019t just cruel, it doesn\u2019t work. Children need our protection, help to learn and grow [and] break cycles of offending and disadvantage.\u201d\nThe age of criminal responsibility is the age at which a child is considered by law to have understood that their actions were wrong and can face criminal charges.

Extra doses were sent near mountain and desert areas, Hanafy said.\nThose stung by the scorpions said their symptoms included severe pain, fever, sweating, vomiting, diarrhoea, muscle tremors, and head twitching.\nThe Aswan mountains are home to the Arabian fat-tailed scorpion, or Androctonus crassicauda, which translates from Greek to \u201cman-killer\u201d, Al Jazeera reported. They are considered among the most dangerous scorpions in the world, with a highly toxic venom but cause only several human deaths a year.\nWith Associated Press",

        "content": "Protesters have co-opted mainstream criticisms of proposed new laws to play to an increasingly polarised political environment\nMainstream criticisms of the Andrews government\u2019s proposed pandemic laws have been co-opted by protesters, including some from the far right, to give weight to a long-running campaign against public health laws, experts say.\nThe Public Health and Wellbeing (Pandemic Management) Bill 2021 was being debated in the upper house on Tuesday. The legislation as introduced by the Andrews government would allow the premier to make an indefinite declaration of a pandemic and state of emergency, give the health minister power to make broad public health orders, and grant authorised officers the power to detain people under quarantine.\nIt will pass with the support of crossbench MPs, who late Monday announced they had negotiated amendments to the legislation which will address some of the concerns raised by civil liberties groups.\nIt follows weeks of protests against the proposed bill, which escalated on Saturday, with thousands of people marching through central Melbourne in a demonstration that included a gallows prop, protesters posing with nooses, and chants of \u201chang Dan Andrews\u201d.\nOn Monday night, a Daniel Andrews blow-up doll was put on the gallows prop in the CBD.\nLast Thursday night a group of protesters also gathered outside the house of Animal Justice party MP Andy Meddick, one of the three key crossbenchers, according to a message posted by him on social media.\nMeddick, who said he and his family have received death threats over the legislation, said he is concerned that hostilities towards politicians could escalate to the point seen in the United Kingdom earlier this year, with the alleged murder of Conservative MP Sir David Amess.\nHe said the amended bill \u201cwill ensure Victoria has the most transparent and accountable pandemic management framework in the country\u201d.\nAmendments negotiated by the crossbenchers include that parliament will be given immediate ability to scrutinise any order, public health orders must explicitly relate to risk, and the maximum financial penalty for the worst breaches of public health orders has been halved \u2013 it\u2019s now $45,000 for individuals down from $91,000.\nIn a group statement with fellow crossbenchers, Reason party leader Fiona Patten and Greens leader Samatha Ratnam, Meddick defended the decision to pass the bill.\n\u201cWhile the official opposition and some prominent shock jocks and tabloid commentators knowingly, dangerously incited and fanned unduly angry civil unrest with lies, the crossbenchers focused on improving the bill to better protect and support the Victorian community,\u201d they said.\nThe legislation has been criticised by the Law Institute of Victoria, the Victorian Bar Association, and the Human Rights Law Centre, who say it grants the government an unlimited power to declare a pandemic, allows the health minister a very broad range of powers during a pandemic, and is lacking oversight mechanisms and transparency.\nBar Association president R\u00f3is\u00edn Annesley QC said on Tuesday that the amendments negotiated by crossbenchers \u201caddress low priority issues and not the most fundamental problems with the bill\u201d.\nBut despite this criticism, most agree with the need for new legislation.\nThe Human Rights Law Centre\u2019s legal director, Daniel Webb, said some commentary around the bill had been \u201cvery misleading\u201d.\n\u201cWhile it\u2019s definitely not perfect, this bill would significantly improve the current law in Victoria,\u201d Webb told Guardian Australia.\nHe said threats and abuse directed at crossbench MPs was \u201cappalling\u201d.\n\u201cThe easy thing for these crossbench MPs to do would have been to just grant another extension under the existing law,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead, they\u2019ve taken advice from a range of experts and worked with the government to try and make the law better.\u201d\nThe legislation has also faced opposition in advertisements funded by high-profile Melbourne business figures, led by Kilara Capital managing director Ben Krasnostein.\nKrasnostein\u2019s company, Climate Smart Investments Pty Ltd, authorised advertisements that appeared in newspapers owned by Nine and News Corp Australia urging people to contact the office of key upper house crossbenchers, including Patten,  who was called on to delay the vote on the legislation as put by the government, or \u201cpass key amendments that honour the Reason Party promise and senior lawyers say are vital\u201d.\nKrasnostein told the Australian Financial Review the ads were funded by a group of people who were disputing sections of the legislation, but did not oppose the Andrews government as a whole. Krasnostein was also quoted in the AFR saying: \u201cWe are not anti-vaxxers, and we agree we need legislation to govern pandemics, we agree with that, and it\u2019s better to have the power in the hands of ministers rather than unelected bureaucrats, we agree with that too \u2026 But we don\u2019t need clauses which, for example, give the power to have authorised officers enter into homes without a warrant and detain people, and a complete lack of judicial oversight.\u201d\nSome protesters have adopted the criticisms of the legislation without adopting the nuance, playing into an increasingly polarised political environment.\nDeakin University senior research fellow Dr Josh Roose, whose work includes researching extremism, said protesters in Melbourne have capitalised on legal and humanitarian criticisms of the legislation to maintain the momentum on anti-government protests, which began as anti-lockdown protests last year, morphed into anti-vaccine mandate protests in July, and were briefly fuelled by outraged construction workers in September.\n\u201cThey are certainly seeking to capitalise on the bill and potential legislation because what they\u2019re able to represent it as is a power grab,\u201d Roose said.\nThere have also been attempts to bring in other activist groups in Melbourne to bolster support for the protests. Meriki Onus, a Gunai and Gunditjmara woman and community organiser, was approached to speak at Saturday\u2019s rally, as was fellow organiser and Yigar Gunditjmara, Bindal, Yorta Yorta and Torres Strait Islander woman Tarneen Onus-Williams. Both declined.\nThe central theme of the protests has been freedom from government control \u2013 over movement, vaccine mandates, and now from laws which have been framed by some legal and political critics as allowing unchecked government interference in people\u2019s lives.\n\u201cThere is a legitimate fear out there that this puts more power in [the government\u2019s] hands, and there\u2019s been very little effort by the government to communicate what this bill is about to the wider public,\u201d Roose said.\nIt appears that some rightwing politicians are willing to capitalise on that polarisation, Deakin University lecturer Dr Imogen Richards said.\nCraig Kelly, recently of the Liberal party and currently representing Clive Palmer\u2019s United Australia party, spoke at the protest on Saturday, telling protesters \u201cwe are coming after the Labor and the Liberal party because you cannot trust them\u201d. Victorian Liberal MP Bernie Finn placed an ad in the Herald Sun urging people to attend the protest, with slogans such as \u201cRISE UP! MELBOURNE\u201d and \u201cstop the power grab!\u201d.\nFinn, who has opposed lockdown measures, has previously expressed support for the anti-vaccine mandate sentiments of some protesters, writing on Facebook in September: \u201cThere is no justification for violence but if any government tried to force medical treatment on me against my will, they\u2019d see a fighting fury.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019d be inaccurate to say it is, in a sense, [a] kind of \u2018unite the right\u2019 protest event,\u201d Richards said. \u201cAnd ironically, some of those interested in the mobilisations of these disparate groups are the very same political entities they\u2019re professing to oppose.\u201d\nThe protesters \u201care being, to a degree, co-opted as a part of Clive Palmer\u2019s political campaign\u201d, which, as Palmer has previously made it clear his party will preference the Liberal party federally, is arguably a campaign to help re-elect the current federal government.\nAt the same time, the presence of Kelly and other sympathetic politicians lends legitimacy to the protests. In response to questions by Guardian Australia, Kelly dismissed concerns about the increase in violent rhetoric at the protests, saying he had not heard the \u201chang Dan Andrews\u201d chant, or seen the nooses, and that it may have been meant \u201cmetaphorically\u201d.\nThe broad swathe of opposition to the proposed pandemic laws has made drawing concrete links between the Melbourne protests and elements of the far right a complex exercise. But like most of the protests in the city during the pandemic, there were elements of hard-right groups among the crowd as well as an increase in overtly violent rhetoric and QAnon-inflected protest signs.\n\u201cThere\u2019s obvious examples of a far-right presence at these protests which are obviously trying to exploit this for the purpose of recruitment,\u201d Richards said.\nAnti-fascist group the White Rose Society posted material online alleging that an individual working as part of Craig Kelly\u2019s personal security for the event was a longtime member of a series of neo-Nazi groups. There is no suggestion by Guardian Australia that Kelly was aware of the individual\u2019s alleged neo-Nazi links and when approached for comment Kelly told Guardian Australia that he did not remember his security guard\u2019s name, and that he was unaware about any political affiliation he might have had.\n\u201cAs far as I know he was qualified, he did a good job, he was efficient and professional and that\u2019s all that should matter,\u201d Kelly said.\nOrganising material distributed on social media sites in the lead up to the Saturday\u2019s demonstration came from established, self described \u201clibertarian and populist activists\u201d \u2013 groups like the Melbourne Freedom Rally, led by serial protester Harrison McLean, whose personal engagement with far-right groups online has been previously reported. McLean has previously denied being involved in the far right.\nThe protest was also pushed by the anti-lockdown protest group Reignite Democracy, which has been accused of spreading various Covid misinformation throughout the pandemic, and has recently announced a collaboration with Kelly and the United Australia Party on what Rebel News described as \u201ca similar pro-freedom, anti-lockdown, pro-vaccine choice platform\u201d.",

There were no deaths.\nIn that period the hospitalisation rate of children reduced from 4.4% in the first fortnight to 2.1% in the last, reflecting higher vaccine coverage and a shift in the location of admissions.\nIn early September the majority of child hospitalisations were in New South Wales because children\u2019s parents were unwell and they are admitted \u201cwith rather than for Covid\u201d, Steer said. Now, the majority are in Victoria.\nSteer said international evidence suggests about 0.7% of children who contract Covid-19 require admission to hospital and 0.07% require intensive care.\nSteer said it was \u201cpleasing to see\u201d that Pfizer results for children aged five to eleven show that it is an effective vaccine and there is \u201cevery reason to think it will be safe\u201d but there is still reason for caution because there is \u201cnot enough information about risks\u201d.\n \nEmail:\u00a0sign up for our\u00a0daily morning and afternoon email newsletters\nApp:\u00a0download our free app\u00a0and never miss the biggest stories\nSocial:\u00a0follow us on YouTube,\u00a0TikTok,\u00a0Instagram,\u00a0Facebook\u00a0or\u00a0Twitter\nPodcast:\u00a0listen to our daily episodes on\u00a0Apple Podcasts,\u00a0Spotify\u00a0or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app\nHe noted there were some cases of mild myocarditis (inflammation of the heart), but children had recovered. Researchers want to see results from the 400,000 children under 12 who have had Pfizer in the US and Canada.\nOn Sunday the health minister, Greg Hunt, said that children aged between five and 11 would not be able to access a vaccine until at least early 2022.\nOn Tuesday, Murdoch\u2019s professor Sharon Goldfield said there was some evidence the pandemic had caused more frequent suicidal and self-harm ideation and presentations to the emergency department, especially at the end of 2020 and beginning of 2021 when Victoria was \u201cin and out of lockdown\u201d.\nAustralian Research Alliance for Children and Youth chief executive, Penny Dakin, noted that children are not represented at the cabinet level in Australia, arguing that because it is \u201ceverybody\u2019s job\u201d it becomes \u201cnobody\u2019s job\u201d to represent them.\nUnicef Australia, director of child rights, Nicole Breeze, said there had been some \u201cmainstreaming\u201d of the approach to children, with policy not designed specifically for their needs.\nLabor\u2019s Katy Gallagher said it \u201cmight shock most Australians\u201d that Australia ranks 32 of 40 countries on Unicef\u2019s Worlds of Influence report on children\u2019s wellbeing, scoring poorly on mental health (35th) and physical health (28th).\nGuardian Australia contacted Hunt and Scott Morrison for comment.",

There was also a heavy fall of thousands \u2013 if not millions \u2013 of leaves but flighting in separate gusts, so on one occasion, while I recognised a lower shower of five-fingered plates as sycamore leaves, there was a higher squall of beech that I initially mistook for a flock of finches.\nHere, by the Angler\u2019s Rest pub, the River Wye was super charged with last week\u2019s rain, and fallen foliage was drifting everywhere in the current. I noticed that a grey heron had just speared what looked to be a little bullhead, but had simultaneously spiked a big yellow\u00a0sycamore leaf.\nAmong a shallower section mid-river, however, where the limestone gravel normally breaks the surface, the whole patch was overtopped by the current. Many of the leaves had got jammed behind these rocks or had somehow got trapped on the riverbed by the weight of the flow, and it was so strewn with submerged foliage that these shallows looked yellow.\nA dipper had found rich pickings among this riverine litter. I watched it for several hours and was most astonished by the way a 60g bird negotiated the torrent with such aplomb. The instant it dived, a black bird was turned into a wriggling jet of silver, sheathed in displaced water. Its other technique was to brace its strong legs and upend, wings forced back to push it down, when it looked like a tiny headless chicken.\nThe proceeds of the efforts elicited two responses. Caddis larvae sheathed in their little stone casings were taken ashore for a good beating on a rock. But other caseless caddis larvae, possibly from the family Hydropsychidae, were clamped in its beak. These primeval beasts wriggled and twisted vigorously, but the dipper swallowed them whole. Most evident was the sheer relish that it showed in all its works. I went back the next day amid rain and the dipper was in exactly the same melancholy spot. But singing.\n Country Diary is on Twitter at @gdncountrydiary",

        "content": "The explosion has increased the chances of a disastrous collision, says a leading astrophysicist, and warns of \u2018real environmental problem\u2019\nWhen Russia fired a missile at one of its own satellites on the weekend, the explosion generated many thousands of pieces of shrapnel that are now zooming around in space at breathtaking speeds.\nIt added to a sizeable volume of debris already in space, intensifying concerns over the risk that rubbish poses to the International Space Station (ISS) and satellites. The danger lies in a possible collision between objects that are hurtling around at 17,000 mph (27,400km/h).\nJonathan McDowell, an astrophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, said there were about 4,000 active satellites and since the Russia test, as many as 19,000 pieces of space debris in low Earth orbit. This is the region of space stretching from about 120 miles to 1,200 miles (200km to 2,000km) above Earth.\nHe said the test would have generated other pieces of shrapnel, too small to show up on radar, that could number in the hundreds of thousands. All up, the explosion probably increased the number of debris objects by around 10%.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a huge increase, but it\u2019s worrying. We have a problem with space junk. So don\u2019t deliberately create more,\u201d he said.\nThe concern is that flying debris may collide with the ISS or a satellite, with the latter helping with a range of things from internet relay to weather services, imaging, studying climate change and spying. At the speed the debris travels, McDowell said it would \u201cpulverise instantly a satellite and completely destroy it\u201d.\nIn the worst-case scenario, there could be so many collisions that low Earth orbit becomes too cluttered with debris for satellites to operate. McDowell said while this is a \u201cdanger\u201d, it\u2019s not something that would happen immediately.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like most environmental problems, it\u2019s not like the oceans are wonderfully clear and then one day they are full of plastic. Things get slowly worse and worse.\u201d\nThe astrophysicist said the number of near-misses in space is rising, and the number of collisions \u2013 while still rare \u2013 is also rising. In March, a piece of Russian debris hit a Chinese satellite, generating a spray of fresh junk. Tracking debris can help avoid mishaps but ultimately, some of it will need to be removed.\nSome progress has been made on this in recent years. McDowell said many involved in space are operating in a \u201ccleaner\u201d way and there are processes that naturally reduce some of the debris. But all of that is wiped out in a day with a collision like the Russia test.\n\u201cAt some point we\u2019re going to have to have space garbage trucks that go up and take some of this stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be expensive. The technology is just about there now, the money is not. But I think it has to come.\u201d\nAdding to his concerns is a steep ramp-up in commercial activity in space which McDowell said had begun to dominate government activity in recent years. Many thousands of new satellites have been launched and up to 100,000 could be added in the next few years.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a real concern that we\u2019re getting a real environmental problem in outer space. Commercial activity isn\u2019t being regulated adequately \u2026 it\u2019s happening faster than regulation,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s largely US and Europeans but even China now is starting to have a true commercial space sector. It\u2019s a bit of a wild west out there.\u201d",

        "content": "Welcome to a new series of long reads: Reconstruction after Covid\nThe generational divide is deforming democracy. But there is a solution\nThere is no good reason to exclude children from the right to vote. Indeed, I believe there is a strong case for lowering the voting age to six, effectively extending the franchise to any child in full-time education. When I have made this case, as I have done in recent years in a variety of different forums, I am always struck by the reaction I get. It is incredulity. What possible reason could there be to do something so seemingly reckless and foolhardy? Most audiences recognise that our democracy is growing fractious, frustrated and frustrating. Our political divisions are wide and our institutions seem ill-equipped to handle them. But nothing surely could justify allowing children to join in. Wouldn\u2019t it simply make everything worse?\nIt would not. In fact, it might make things better. But to understand why, we first need to understand the nature of the problems our democracy faces, and in particular, the generational divide that has become an increasingly important factor in politics over recent decades.\nWe have never been more divided. And yet we have never had more in common. Britain, like other western democracies, is split down the middle on most of the big political questions. Brexiteers square up against remainers. The north opposes the south. It\u2019s the city v the countryside. Graduates confront non-graduates. But at the same time, we increasingly share a single frame of reference. We watch the same TV shows, circle round the same topics of conversation and obsess over the same celebrities. When Oprah interviewed Harry and Meghan, responses to what they said were conditioned by political tribalism. Tell me how you voted in the Brexit referendum and I\u2019d have a good idea of whether you were team Meghan or team Kate. Still, we all tuned in together. And when it was broadcast, we were all under lockdown together.\nThe contours of this new landscape \u2013 politically divided, socially connected \u2013 are most stark when it comes to intergenerational conflict. If the franchise at the 2019 UK general election had been limited to the under-30s, Jeremy Corbyn would have won the biggest landslide in Labour\u2019s history. If it had been limited to the over-60s, the Tories would have won almost every seat in the land. The old and the young have become two separate political nations. But they are not, as Disraeli once said of the rich and the poor, \u201ctwo nations between whom there is no intercourse and no sympathy, who are as ignorant of each other\u2019s habits, thoughts and feelings, as if they were dwellers in different zones, or inhabitants of different planets\u201d. Young and old interact at almost every level of their lives. Family life is built on that interaction. Far from inhabiting separate planets, the different generations often inhabit the same homes.\nOf course, families can be places of deep antagonism, too, especially when young and old are forced together under one roof. No society has ever been free of intergenerational conflict. What makes our society different is that the generations diverge so profoundly over politics while coming together over so much else. When I was a child in the 1970s, pop music was primarily for the young. Older generations were more likely to listen to classical music, or big bands, or show tunes. Kids swore, but not in front of their parents. Their parents swore, but not in front of the children. Young people wore jeans, but their grandparents didn\u2019t. They still wore jackets and ties, or skirts and dresses. When the weather got warmer, the young would strip off, but that was a privilege of youth. The old had to sweat it out. Go to any high street now on a hot summer\u2019s day and count the men in shorts, regardless of age. The sixtysomethings will often be dressed like the children.\nWhat, then, explains the widening political divide that lies behind our growing social conformity? The answer is a combination of demography and geography. Ours are now rapidly ageing societies in which older voters have come to outnumber the young. This is the case across Europe, in the US and increasingly in Asia, too. The traditional dynamic of intergenerational conflict was that even if the older generations had the wealth and the power, the young had the numbers. In all democratic societies, from ancient Athens to 1970s Britain, there were many more voters under 40 than over 60. That is no longer the case. Our growing social conformity is not simply because the old are aping the habits of the young. It is because in any society where the middle-aged and elderly are the dominant economic and political blocs, their interests predominate. Pop music used to be for the young because that\u2019s where the market was. Now it is people like me who are being catered for (I\u2019m 54). It\u2019s my 12-year-old son who is finding himself listening to the music of my youth, not the other way round.\nThe reason that the outcome of the 2019 general election looked more like the map of an elderly political nation than a youthful one is simple weight of numbers. The over-65s, who at the dawn of modern mass democracy 100 years ago made up barely 5% of the electorate, are now closer to 20%. What\u2019s more, older voters tend to turn out in far higher numbers than the young. The conventional lament of progressive politicians was that if only people in their 20s voted with the same dedication as people in their 70s, they could tip the balance. It was assumed that elections kept going against younger voters\u2019 interests because they failed to show up at the polls. Now it\u2019s as plausible to argue that they fail to show up because elections keep going against their interests. Why bother if the system is stacked against you?\nThis effect has been exacerbated by geographical movement, which congregates significant numbers of younger voters in cities and university towns, where they relocate for work and education. The concerted expansion of higher education from the 1980s onwards has led to a large-scale migration of those in their late teens and early 20s from their home towns, often never to return. The places they go to \u2013 Brighton or Bristol, Canterbury or Cambridge \u2013 have become far more likely to return Labour MPs, because there the young can tip the balance. But as their votes pile up in densely populated metropolitan areas, the places they leave behind have started returning Conservative MPs in ever-greater numbers. The \u201cred wall\u201d seats that turned blue in 2019 have been left behind in this sense at least: the average age of their constituents is far higher that it was before so many students departed.\nThere is now a set of vicious circles at work. Once politicians representing older voters start winning elections time and again, the young are discouraged from voting, which only makes the political imbalance worse. If young people pursue social mobility by moving to places where other young people are, they increase the likelihood that older voters will dominate electoral outcomes everywhere else. The result will be governments and policies that work against the sorts of social mobility that younger voters tend to favour. This has been the pattern in Britain for the best part of a generation. Pensions will get protected while student debt goes unaddressed. The interests of mortgage payers will be prioritised over the interests of renters. A country in which more than 70% of the under-30s voted to remain in the EU will still choose to leave. Once the old outnumber the young, the political divisions between them will grow. Even if everyone is watching Bridgerton.\nWhen the pandemic arrived, it briefly seemed likeas if these generational divisions might be somewhat healed. We all faced a common enemy. The lockdown rules applied to everyone, and the experience of being stuck at home generated a whole new set of common reference points. Griping about Zoom \u2013 for work, for family calls, for anything \u2013 became a habit for young and old alike. Being cooped up, getting used to wearing masks, trying to understand the new rules \u2013 these were all things we endured in common, with the same dates in our calendars and the same sense of disappointment as they came and went without clear resolution. Our social connectedness has never been more vividly on display than when we went into enforced isolation from each other.\nBut this sense of connection simply hid a more familiar pattern. In a society where demography and geography are widening the political divisions between the generations, the pandemic has done nothing to bridge them. It has made them worse. The worst consequences of the virus are very unevenly distributed. The chances of dying from Covid-19 are vastly greater for the over-70s than the under-30s. That of course is why the old have been prioritised throughout: for protection, for treatment, for vaccination. Neither politicians nor the public have had much choice about this: the profile of the disease meant there was no other option.\nIn this, the effects of Covid-19 are part of a longstanding trend. As the population ages, healthcare becomes more and more of a political priority. Older people have a greater need for it, and the working population is required to pay for it. Because older people determine the results of elections, politicians do everything in their power to maintain this equation. The totemic status of the NHS throughout its existence conceals a profound shift in its primary purpose. When it was founded in 1948, its priority was infant health, in a society in which infant mortality was high, childhood diseases were still rife and children made up a far higher proportion of the overall population. Now the NHS is required to focus on elderly people, and their interests come first. Covid has not skewed our political priorities when it comes to health. It has simply revealed them.\nThe pandemic has highlighted generational imbalances without doing anything to resolve them. Politicians talk about rewarding the young for the sacrifices they have made, but our political system does little to incentivise politicians to turn those words into actions. The young can plausibly claim that democracy presently discriminates against them in more ways than one. Not only are their votes regularly outweighed, but their representatives are rarely from their own generation. The average age of members of the House of Commons has barely changed in a century: it moves up and down from parliament to parliament, but never far away from 50. It is currently 51, roughly where it was after the first world war. It is true that there are more MPs in their 20s in the parliament elected in 2019 than ever before. But it is only 21, and still vastly outnumbered by the 300 MPs in their 50s and 60s, and fewer even that the number of MPs over 70.\nYet there is another source of democratic discrimination that is rarely, if ever, discussed. The reason the over-60s outnumber the under-40s at the polls is not because they represent a higher portion of the overall population. They don\u2019t. The median age in the UK is 40.4, which means there are almost as many people under 40 as there are older than that. The over-60s, though far more numerous than they used to be even a generation ago, are still only a minority of the total. But democracy does not work like that. There is no cutoff at the top end, so that the over-60s includes the increasing number of people in their 70s, 80s and above. But we do exclude anyone under the age of 18 (or 16 in Scotland) from full democratic citizenship, including the right to vote. We do this because that is the way it has always been.\nWhen it comes to democracy, children don\u2019t count. Why not?\nThe arguments against allowing children to vote always start with the basic question of competence. But what that means is that we are applying standards to children that we have given up applying to anyone else. It is true, of course, that many children would struggle to understand complex political questions, especially younger children. It is hard to envisage a group of six-year-olds getting to grips with fiscal policy. But many adults also struggle with complex political questions, and all of us have big gaps in our political understanding. (I say this as someone who studies politics for a living, and not because I have studied the ignorance of others, but because I am reminded daily of my own.) The fact is that we don\u2019t apply a test of competence before granting the right to vote to anyone other than children. So why start with them?\nSetting imaginary tests before allowing enfranchisement is an essentially 19th-century idea. The basis of the principle of universal suffrage that replaced it is that we no longer believe voting is a right that belongs to individuals on the grounds of their competence to exercise it. Instead, it is a right that belongs to each of us because we are members of a democratic political community, and will have to live with the consequences of the decisions that are made by politicians on our behalf. If we suffer the consequences of those decisions, we should have a right to express a view about who gets to decide. That applies to children just as much as adults.\nPerhaps, instead, the argument against letting children vote is less a principled one than a pragmatic one. Surely more adults are likely to understand what is at stake in an election than a group of schoolchildren. But that depends a great deal on how we conceive of the groups in question. It is striking how often sceptical audiences jump to the conclusion that lowering the voting age to six would mean giving six-year-olds a decisive say in the running of the country. That is absurd: the lower age group would be a small minority of children overall, just as children would still be a minority of the overall electorate. Older voters in any instance can always outvote the young. But if we take children in education as a whole, there is a good chance that some groups will be better informed than many adults. They have the time and the resources to learn what is at stake if they want to. No one can be obliged to take an interest in politics, but that is as true of adults as of children. The difference is that children in school are better placed to make up the gaps in their knowledge.\nThe question of competence \u2013 and the difficulty of using it as an argument against extending the vote to children \u2013 is especially acute in ageing societies such as our own. As the population ages, so the number of voters suffering from dementia and other forms of cognitive decline rises. But we don\u2019t take the vote away from old people, and we don\u2019t apply tests of competence to individuals in their 80s and 90s. Again, it is very striking how often I find that when pressed on this point, audiences will say that rather than giving votes to children it would be better \u2013 safer? \u2013 to disenfranchise elderly people. The 19th-century assumption that we ought to discriminate on grounds of competence has not gone away.\nYet it would not be better \u2013 certainly not safer \u2013 to disenfranchise elderly people. As soon as anyone suggests a programme of mass disenfranchisement, we should always ask how it would be done. By doctors? By going into care homes and asking the residents to take a test? By simply arriving at some arbitrary cut-off point, say the age of 80? How would the many actively engaged and extremely well-informed voters in their 80s take to being told that they have lost the right to vote because others of their age have been deemed unfit to exercise it?\nThere is a lot to be said for the principle of universal suffrage, not least that it sticks to the basic democratic idea of one person, one vote. It does not play around with quotas and competencies and tests. Taking the vote away from elderly people would violate that principle. Giving the vote to children upholds and extends it.\nThere are plenty of other arguments that are made against allowing children to vote. One of the commonest is that they would simply do what their parents say. In the early years of the 20th century it was often said that it would be pointless to give women the vote because they would just do what their husbands say. This was not true, of course. Women were as capable of making their own choices as men, and they often voted differently from their husbands. Would children be any less independent? We might think that they would be more susceptible to parental pressure than adults are to spousal pressure, but in truth we have no idea because we have never tried to find out. Do children follow their parents\u2019 views on other matters than politics? Sometimes, but not always. Do children ever decide to embrace the opposite of what their parents think? Not always, but often enough.\nIt seems just as likely that children would be influenced in other ways. Perhaps by their grandparents, especially since many school-age children of working parents spend as much time with grandparents as with parents. Perhaps by their teachers, or by their friends, or by their favourite YouTube stars, or by footballers, or by superheroes. So, you might say, I am admitting that children would be susceptible to all sorts of external pressures. Of course \u2013 but so are adults. There is overwhelming social science evidence that all voters, old and young, educated and uneducated, make their political choices on the basis of loyalties, identities and forms of peer pressure that often have little or nothing to do with politics, and certainly are far removed from the political issues that are the focus of high-level debate. We are all politically tribal in one way or another. Do we know whether six-year-olds might turn out to be more conservative than their parents? We don\u2019t, but there is only one way to find out. Let them vote.\nBut shouldn\u2019t children be protected for as long as possible from having to deal with the harsh realities of the adult world? Shouldn\u2019t we preserve them from grownup responsibilities? These are also familiar arguments, and ones that were made against giving votes to women: why burden anyone with unnecessary responsibilities when the hard work of taking difficult decisions can be left to others? Simone de Beauvoir had a clear response to this line of thought in The Second Sex: it\u2019s always the people with power who say they want to protect others from exercising it. Men say it. Women don\u2019t. Colonisers say it. The colonised don\u2019t. Adults say it. Children don\u2019t. People without a say don\u2019t want to be protected from the burden of having a say. They want to experience it. And once experienced, they don\u2019t want to give it up.\nAre children a special case? It is often assumed that getting children involved in politics would corrupt them because politics is such a nasty business. But I believe the opposite is the case. Bringing politics into schools wouldn\u2019t make schools worse. It would make politics better, precisely because we take the protection of children seriously. Consider this thought experiment. Think of an adult political debate: BBC Question Time, for example, with all its grandstanding and rabble-rousing and howling partisanship. Then think of a similar debate, discussing similar issues, taking place in front of an audience of primary-aged schoolchildren, with their teachers watching on. Would the conversation be worse-tempered? Or would it be conducted better? Would it perhaps even be better informed?\nWhat\u2019s left of the argument against letting children vote is more straightforwardly partisan. Given the competing, age-based electoral maps that divide the UK into the Corbyn/remain nation of the young and the Johnson/Brexit nation of the old, extending the franchise in this way can look like blatant gerrymandering \u2013 a desperate way to reverse Labour\u2019s seemingly grim electoral prospects. Lowering the voting age to 16, which has happened in Scotland, sometimes appears to be a piece of naked political engineering. Because younger voters tend to be left-leaning on a range of issues, increasing their number could be expected to tip the balance in favour of particular causes. Wouldn\u2019t lowering the voting age to six be more of the same? No. First, because we don\u2019t know how children would vote: they don\u2019t tend to get polled, so no one has really asked them. Second, because large-scale enfranchisements rarely have the anticipated effect.\nLowering the voting age by two years would be a piecemeal reform that could be seen as gerrymandering. The great advantage of lowering the voting age by 12 years is that it would be far less predictable. It would be comparable to the other great enfranchisements, including working men in the 19th century and women in the 20th. These changes created opportunities for all political parties and required a far more inclusive and imaginative conception of the electorate. In both cases \u2013 contrary to expectations \u2013 the Conservative party discovered how to broaden its appeal. I am not saying that would happen in this case. I am simply saying we don\u2019t know.\nWhy, then, have an arbitrary age threshold at all? Why not make voting a human right \u2013 or even a birthright \u2013 and give the vote to everyone from the first day of their lives to the last? Though some political theorists have argued for this, it falls down on practical grounds, because babies and small children would need someone to exercise that vote for them. Once voting becomes a system of proxies and surrogates, it loses the simplicity and clarity of one person, one vote. I do believe in a very basic competence threshold, which is the ability to express a preference in the first place. Being in full-time education seems a reasonable way of establishing that \u2013 if you can go to school, you can put a cross against a box or press a button on a voting machine. That means you can vote.\nThe right to vote goes along with having a share in the fate of a democratic community and having to live with the consequences of the decisions that are made by those in power. Children will have to live with those consequences longer than anyone. If it is argued that they nonetheless do not share in the life of the community in the same way as adults, because they do not earn, or pay tax, or perform public service, we must remember that we stopped making those prerequisites of enfranchisement a long time ago. Adults can vote regardless of the taxes they do or do not pay, of the public services they do or do not perform, of whether they are net contributors to or net beneficiaries of the public purse. They can vote because we all have things in common that transcend our individual contributions. We have preferences and opinions and hopes and fears. Voting is one way \u2013 not the only way, and by no means always the most effective, but still one of the most important \u2013 to be heard. Children deserve the same.\nThere is clear evidence that children feel more strongly about some questions than older voters. Education ranks highly as a priority for young and old, but environmental concerns are a far greater priority for the young. This may be because younger people \u2013 with a life ahead of them \u2013 have longer time horizons. Or it may be something else: fashion, peer pressure, groupthink. It doesn\u2019t matter. Preferences are preferences, interests are interests, and the fact that they emanate from children does not invalidate them. All preferences should count. It would be better for everyone if they did.\nGiving children the vote would not, contrary to many people\u2019s expectations, be transformative. Mass enfranchisements rarely are. The same kinds of people still end up getting elected, because the incentives for becoming a politician do not change. As the old saying goes, if voting really changed anything, they would abolish it. But voting still matters. I am not arguing for six-year-olds to be in parliament, which would be revolutionary (and, frankly, a little mad). I simply believe that everyone should be able to take part in the electoral process, and to have an opportunity for politicians to ask them what they think and to take account of what they say in constructing their political programmes. Put that way, it is a far less radical idea than it sounds.\nSome things would change. Climate politics would probably rise more rapidly up the political agenda. Time horizons for some political decisions might alter. Politicians would have a wider range of views to consider. I do not believe that anyone involved in this newly expanded democracy would become a better person as a result. Politics would still be a cutthroat business. Children would no more be improved by taking part in elections than adults are. This is not about giving children a civics lesson \u2013 electoral democracy has never been about that. Giving children the vote would not let children control the future \u2013 the adults would still be in charge. But it could invigorate our democracy, improve it, vary it, leave it a little less ossified, a little less predictable, a little less stale.\nIt might also help bridge the generational divide. In some ways, children do inhabit a different planet from the rest of us. We don\u2019t watch the same TV programmes as they do, unless we have no choice. The lives of six-year-olds are deeply mysterious to most adults. That is a large part of why democratic politics should at least be open to their perspective. But at the same time, children don\u2019t live apart from older generations. They don\u2019t migrate to places where they can pursue the lives they want to lead. They are forced to coexist with the grownups. However much they might prefer it otherwise, they have to listen, if only because the grownups still get to call the shots. Children talk to their parents and grandparents, their teachers and guardians. The adults don\u2019t always listen in return, though it would be far better if they did. But the conversations are real, which is the precondition of democratic politics.\nThe political theorist John Wall, in his forthcoming book Give Children the Vote, writes of the enfranchisement of the roughly one-quarter of the population to whom it is routinely denied: \u201cIt is vital to making contemporary societies more democratic. It is the only way to pressure political leaders to respond to the lived experiences of all instead of just some of the people. It is the only way to make the franchise fully just and effective \u2026 It is not the answer to everything. But it must be part of the solution. Things need realigning and this is arguably our best hope for doing so. No politics is ever perfect. But if societies want to be truly democratic, they need to overcome their engrained biases and embrace the whole human community.\u201d\nThe pandemic has given an opportunity to rethink assumptions that we take for granted. Political choices that would have seemed impossible two years ago have become routine.

        "content": "Doctors have been surprised to see young adults developing tics and seizures that usually start in childhood. Social media has been blamed, but the reality is more complicated\nMichelle Wacek was a TikTok fan years ago, back when the video-sharing app was called Musical.ly. \u201cI went on it for a laugh,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd then I got sucked into the vortex.\u201d She took part in lip-syncing challenges, and followed the influencer Evie Meg, who raises awareness about Tourette syndrome among her 14 million followers.\nIn April 2020, Wacek was messing around in the kitchen when her husband accidentally clipped her in the face. The then 25-year-old chef had a panic attack. \u201cIt triggered a PTSD response from a previous abusive relationship I was in,\u201d she says.\nOver the next few weeks, Wacek noticed that she was having tics. \u201cThey were just little noises,\u201d she says. \u201cNothing to write home about.\u201d She would scrunch up her nose, or huff. The tics escalated from sounds into words and phrases. Then the motor tics kicked in. \u201cI started punching walls and throwing myself at things,\u201d she says. By July, Wacek was having seizures. She had to stop work. \u201cBeing a chef with seizures is not safe at all,\u201d she says.\nHer GP referred her to a neurologist, who diagnosed her with functional neurological syndrome (FND). People with FND have a neurological condition that cannot be medically explained, but can be extremely debilitating. \u201cIn a general neurological clinic, around 30% of the conditions we see are not fully explainable,\u201d says Dr Jeremy Stern, a neurologist with the charity Tourettes Action. In Wacek\u2019s case, FND manifested in verbal and motor tics, not dissimilar from how Tourette syndrome appears to lay people, although the two conditions are distinct.\nWacek has up to 20 seizures a day and currently has to use a wheelchair. Like Meg, she is now a TikTok influencer, using her platform to raise awareness of FND. \u201cKnowing that I am going through the same crap as other people out there makes me feel better,\u201d Wacek says. \u201cWithout all these platforms, I would be quite isolated.\u201d\nThis month, Wacek\u2019s Facebook groups and online communities lit up. The source: a Wall Street Journal report about the rise in young women developing sudden-onset tics that doctors thought could be linked to TikTok. The article prompted a swift backlash from many in the Tourette\u2019s and FND community. \u201cI read the article and thought it was a load of crap,\u201d says Wacek. \u201cTikTok is not giving people Tourette\u2019s.\u201d The fact that she followed Meg before developing tics herself, says Wacek, is a \u201ccoincidence\u201d.\nBut there is a rise in young women presenting with unexplained tics that come on suddenly, far later in life than the usual presentation for Tourette syndrome. Some of these young people are social media users, some are not. What on earth is going on?\nThe neurological journal Brain isn\u2019t typically the locus of international controversy. But times are changing. \u201cJournals are more open-access than ever before,\u201d says Dr Seonaid Anderson, a research psychologist and neurodiversity consultant who specialises in Tourette syndrome. \u201cPeople with neurodiverse conditions can access what is being written about them far more freely. Webinars often feature patients in the audience.\u201d\nIn August, Brain published a paper with the incendiary headline: \u201cStop that! It\u2019s not Tourette\u2019s but a new type of mass sociogenic illness\u201d. In it, clinicians from Hannover Medical School in Germany speculated that a mass sociogenic illness (MSI) that resembled Tourette\u2019s but was not Tourette\u2019s, was spreading among German teenagers. A sociogenic illness, explains researcher Dr Kirsten M\u00fcller-Vahl, \u201cis when people who are in close contact develop similar symptoms, but without any underlying cause\u201d.\nA mass MSI outbreak was seen in the UK at a Lancashire school in 2015, where 40 pupils received medical treatment for dizziness thought to be brought on by anxiety after a handful of children fainted during an Armistice Day service in a warm assembly hall. MSI is currently in the news as a possible cause for the mysterious Havana syndrome, which is affecting diplomats at US bases across the world. But experts did not believe MSI could be spread via social media \u2013 until the Hannover team\u2019s research.\nMSI ripples outwards from a \u201cpatient zero\u201d, infecting the people around that person in waves of anxiety-induced illness. \u201cPeople now use social media so intensively that it more or less replaces our normal context,\u201d says M\u00fcller-Vahl. \u201cYou can be in close contact with someone via social media, it can be very emotional, and you can identify with that influencer. We believe that spread can happen solely via social media.\u201d In this case, M\u00fcller-Vahl identifies this patient zero as a German YouTuber, Jan Zimmerman, who has Tourette syndrome and runs a channel with 2.2 million subscribers.\nIn 2019, M\u00fcller-Vahl says, teenagers began to present at her clinic with functional Tourette\u2019s-like symptoms, a subset of FND. Typically, Tourette\u2019s starts during childhood, with six the average age of onset. But the mean onset age of M\u00fcller-Vahl\u2019s patients was 19. Their symptoms also escalated more quickly than typical Tourette\u2019s. In all, since 2019 M\u00fcller-Vahl has seen nearly 50 young people; all of them confirmed that they watched Zimmerman\u2019s channel. She believes FND was spread via social media contagion, in much the same way that a fainting fit ripples through a packed school hall.\nM\u00fcller-Vahl is not accusing young people of faking illness. \u201cI know no expert who feels this is malingering,\u201d she says. But the title of her paper \u2013 Stop That! \u2013 was interpreted that way. \u201cPeople criticised our title because it was a bit provocative,\u201d says M\u00fcller-Vahl, sounding exasperated. \u201cBut we are not saying to the patients: \u2018Stop that.\u2019 It\u2019s addressed to medical doctors. Stop diagnosing this as Tourette\u2019s, when it\u2019s FND.\u201d\nBe that as it may, says Anderson, \u201cIt\u2019s easy for the public to think people are saying that you should stop your tics. We want people to get away from that view, which is linked to the dark days of previous years.\u201d\nThe phenomenon M\u00fcller-Vahl\u2019s team observed \u2013 young people with sudden-onset tics, thought to be FND and possibly linked to social media exposure \u2013 has been observed by clinicians globally. With the exception of M\u00fcller-Vahl\u2019s own study, most of those with the symptoms are female. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen groups of teenage girls from the same school who develop almost identical tics,\u201d says Dr Tammy Hedderly, a paediatric neurologist at Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 NHS trust. Stern has likewise heard of outbreaks in UK schools.\n\u201cThey shout \u2018Baked beans!\u2019 or hit their parents on the head,\u201d says Hedderly. \u201cWhen a 15-year-old girl walks into my clinic shouting \u2018Baked beans!\u2019, my first question is: \u2018Have you been watching this influencer? Because I know all the names of the influencers. So it\u2019s important to recognise that social media does play a role and the scale of the problem is wide, across the UK.\u201d\nIn the US, Dr Caroline Olvera, a neurologist, has also seen an increasing number of young people, mostly girls, presenting with sudden-onset tics. She wrote a research paper based on her study of more than 3,000 videos of TikTok Tourette\u2019s influencers, observing: \u201cDespite our study cohort spanning different countries, 67.9% of the cohort mentioned their TikTok tics were from other content creators, and the majority had the same vocal tic.\u201d\nOlvera\u2019s research has not gone down well in some quarters. \u201cI\u2019m frustrated,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to stop reading a lot of what is written out there.\u201d She\u2019s received \u201clots\u201d of angry emails. \u201cMy colleagues have had a positive response to my research,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s been perceived appropriately by the public. The last thing I would want is for my patients to walk away from this thinking that their disorder is fake or not worthwhile.\u201d\nMuch of the controversy arises from the misapprehension that doctors are accusing young people of faking Tourette\u2019s for attention, or arguing that TikTok is giving people Tourette\u2019s. Neither claim is true. \u201cWhat the media has boiled it down to,\u201d says Olvera, \u201cis that if it\u2019s not Tourette syndrome, it\u2019s fake. But just because it\u2019s not Tourette syndrome doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s fake. This is a real condition. Even though it\u2019s not typical Tourette\u2019s, it\u2019s very disruptive and stressful.\u201d\nMeg Jones, 17, began experiencing tics in February this year. \u201cI was really stressed out,\u201d she says. Her puppy was sick, and Meg was behind at school. \u201cI had teachers phoning me non-stop, asking me where my work was,\u201d she says. \u201cAt one point I broke down.\u201d The tics started with neck jerks and escalated within weeks. Meg would hit her friends and head-butt things. By May, she was having seizures.\nMeg was recently diagnosed provisionally with Tourette\u2019s \u2013 over the phone. \u201cThe call was less than five minutes long,\u201d she says. \u201cThe neurologist didn\u2019t say much. He just said, \u2018I believe you have Tourette\u2019s.\u2019\u201d (A diagnosis of Tourette syndrome requires a person to have had verbal and motor tics for at least one year.) She is on the child and adolescent mental health services (Camhs) waiting list. \u201cIf I was to look at my life and think of all the things I can\u2019t do at this point, and how uncertain the future is,\u201d says Meg, \u201cI would become extremely depressed.\u201d\nAfter she developed tics, Meg started to follow TikTok influencers with Tourette\u2019s. She is a fan of @UncleTics, a New Zealand influencer with 3.2 million followers. \u201cFinding people who are going through the same thing helps a lot,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I also noticed that watching other people tic made me tic.\u201d She picked up specific vocal tics from these TikTok accounts, such as blurting out the word \u201clesbian\u201d.\nIt is widely accepted by experts that tics are \u201csuggestible\u201d, meaning that people with tics often trigger new tics in each other. \u201cWe know that when people with Tourette\u2019s get together in support groups,\u201d says Anderson, \u201cthey may pick up each other\u2019s tics, although it\u2019s usually for only a few hours.\u201d It is not that TikTok is giving people tics; rather, it may be triggering tics in people who are searching social media for information about their condition. \u201cSocial media can\u2019t create tics,\u201d Anderson argues. \u201cWhat it might do is trigger someone who is already susceptible.\u201d\n\u201cThe safety and wellbeing of our community is our priority,\u201d a TikTok spokesperson says. \u201cWe\u2019re consulting with industry experts to better understand this specific experience. We\u2019re proud that people living with Tourette syndrome have found a home on TikTok where they can fight stigma, find community and express themselves authentically.\u201d\nMeg, meanwhile, isn\u2019t consciously imitating the influencers she sees on TikTok. \u201cI\u2019ve had people at my school tell me that I\u2019m an attention seeker,\u201d she says. \u201cBut if they were put in my shoes, they\u2019d know that\u2019s not true \u2026 Imagine straining your neck for hours a day and not being able to move. As much as I find myself hilarious and laugh about it with my friends, I would 1,000% choose not to have this over having the attention, any day.\u201d\nSuggestibility can trigger tics even in the classroom. Chloe (not her real name), 14, received a diagnosis of Tourette syndrome in July. \u201cThe tics started 18 months ago,\u201d says her mother, Jill (also not her real name). \u201cBut she\u2019d been suppressing them, until everything came out in September last year. The stress of the pandemic made it too difficult to hold them in.\u201d Chloe had to take time off school this year. \u201cDuring the time she was off,\u201d says Jill, \u201canother girl in her class developed tics.\u201d Now both girls are in the same classroom, which poses a problem. \u201cThey set each other off,\u201d Jill explains.\nIt should not be surprising that the stress of the pandemic is causing young people to present with tics, which are often exacerbated by stress and anxiety. It should also not be surprising that social media use may worsen tics in people with an underlying predisposition, in the same way that social media is known to correlate with other negative mental health outcomes. Stern advises patients to limit social media exposure for this reason.\nWhat is surprising, and dispiriting, is the extent to which stigma persists around little-known conditions such as FND, and the lack of support available to people with tics. \u201cRegardless of why these tics are happening,\u201d says Jess Thom of the blog Tourette\u2019s Hero, \u201cwhether they are functional (FND) or Tourette\u2019s, the symptoms are real and not the fault of these young people who are in need of support that doesn\u2019t really exist.\u201d\nNHS mental health services are at breaking point due to a post-pandemic backlog. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of families waiting between two and four years to be seen by Camhs,\u201d says Anderson. Chloe is on a two-year waiting list to see a neurologist. Wacek is waiting to see a neurotherapist; in desperation, she called 111 recently, only to speak to a brusque and unsympathetic doctor. \u201cHe said I was doing it to myself,\u201d she recalls. \u201cWhich made me feel worse, which made me have more seizures.\u201d\nIn Wales, there is currently no paediatric neurologist who specialises in Tourette syndrome. \u201cIt\u2019s shocking,\u201d says Helen Reeves, 42, from Pembrokeshire. Her 13-year-old daughter developed sudden-onset tics in August. \u201cYou go to the paediatrician with symptoms and they ask me what I think it might be.\u201d Reeves is campaigning for better provision: a petition she started has more than 7,000 signatures. It is a similar story in much of the UK. \u201cThere are hardly any pathways through to consultants,\u201d says Paul Stevenson, 58, of Berwick-upon-Tweed. His son developed sudden-onset tics last year. \u201cAll these people are going through this traumatic period, and doctors are not fully understanding what is going on.\u201d\nIn the absence of specialist support, young people can only hope their tics become more manageable with time. A couple of weekends ago, Meg went away with friends to Cardiff. It was the first ordinary thing she has managed since her tics came on. \u201cThat was a major thing,\u201d she says. \u201cTo be a normal independent teenager.\u201d Next year, her friends will apply to university. She wants to apply too, but is worried. \u201cWhat if I had a seizure and no one knew what was going on?\u201d says Meg. \u201cThe unknown is scary. But I don\u2019t want to be afraid of my life.\u201d\n This article was amended on 16 November 2021 to attribute the following quote to Seonaid Anderson, instead of Tammy Hedderly: \u201cI\u2019ve heard of families waiting between two and four years to be seen by Camhs.\u201d",

        "content": "What would you like to ask the Swedish star of Marvel movies, Lars von Trier films, Mamma Mia! and many, many more?\nNo one could accuse Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd of sloth. The father of eight (including Alexander, Bill and five other boys and one girl) has one of the most wide-ranging and well-populated filmographies of an actor still working.\nYet until he was 45, his was a largely unfamiliar name to those outside the cinema of his native Sweden. That changed in 1996 when he starred alongside Emily Watson in Breaking the Waves: the film which marked a breakthrough for both actors, as well as its director, Lars von Trier.\nSkarsg\u00e5rd has since collaborated with Von Trier on Dancer in the Dark, Dogville, Melancholia and Nymphomaniac, but quickly spread his wings across a broad range of genres in US cinema, too: before the end of the century he\u2019d also featured in Amistad, Good Will Hunting, Ronin, Deep Blue Sea, Timecode and Kiss Kiss (Bang Bang).\nHe channelled Max von Sydow for a couple of Exorcist films in the early 2000s, then got rolled in cockles for a couple of Pirates of the Caribbean adventures. He was one of Meryl Steep\u2019s old flames in 2008\u2019s Mamma Mia! (and the 2018 followup) and then began his stint as a sometime-nude astrophysicist in assorted Avengers movies, beginning with Kenneth Branagh\u2019s Thor and ending with Joss Whedon\u2019s Age of Ultron.\nOther films included The Railway Man, opposite Colin Firth, David Fincher\u2019s The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, Branagh\u2019s Cinderella and John le Carr\u00e9 adaptation Our Kind of Traitor. More recently he\u2019s been seen in Terry Gilliam\u2019s The Man Who Killed Don Quixote, horrific war movie The Painted Bird, the TV show Chernobyl and Denis Villeneuve\u2019s Dune.\nNext up is Hope, the Norwegian entry for the Oscars earlier this year, in which he plays a man whose wife is diagnosed with a brain tumour.\nAs well as being an enormously respected actor, Skarsg\u00e5rd has earned a considerable reputation for fun-loving, irreverence and loyalty. Although he played a heap of snow in a school play, he grew up wanting to be a diplomat, before early encounters with the opposite sex made acting seem a more attractive option.\nHis friend, Paul Bettany, who named his son after him, has called Skarsg\u00e5rd \u201cthe all-time heavyweight vodka-drinking champion of the world\u201d; sample quote from the man himself includes \u201cI have a very relaxed relationship with my genitals.\u201d\nLast month he went viral for a forensic explanation of why market forces \u2013 rather than Marvel or Netflix \u2013 are destroying cinema.\nStellan Skarsg\u00e5rd dropping that truth pic.twitter.com/NskpAOroqR\nPost your questions for Skarsg\u00e5rd below; comments will close at midday on Wednesday and his responses will be published in Film&Music on 26 November (and online the previous day). Hope is released in the UK on 10 December.",

        "content": "Intensive agriculture\u2019s insatiable thirst for water is turning wetland to wasteland, draining rivers and polluting groundwater\nA wetland without water is a melancholy sight. The fish are dead, the birds have flown and a lifeless silence hangs over the place. \u201cEverything you see around you should be under water,\u201d says Ecologists in Action\u2019s Rafa Gos\u00e1lvez from the lookout in Las Tablas de Daimiel national park. The park has been dry for three years and where there were once aquatic species such as ducks, herons, egrets and freshwater crayfish, as well as tree frogs and the European polecat, now the wildlife has mostly vanished.\nLas Tablas de Daimiel is a unique wetland in the vast, almost treeless plains of Castilla-La Mancha in central Spain. But the park has had the life sucked out of it to slake intensive agriculture\u2019s insatiable thirst.\nSixty-seven per cent of the water used in Spain goes to agriculture, according to the OECD, but this rises to as much as 85-90% in the south-east, says Julia Mart\u00ednez-Fern\u00e1ndez, technical director of the New Water Culture Foundation, which promotes the sustainable use of water.\nLas Tablas\u2019 ecosystem relies on water from rainfall, the Guadiana river and a huge aquifer, but the climate crisis has resulted in Spain\u2019s periods of drought getting longer. The Guadiana is drying up, while agriculture has depleted the aquifer and polluted the groundwater with phosphates and other chemical fertilisers. In 2009, the wetland was so dry that subterranean peat fires broke out.\nThe 3,000 hectares (7,400 acres) of Las Tablas are all that remain of what, according to the World Wildlife Fund, was once a system of 50,000 hectares of wetland in Castilla-La Mancha.\nGos\u00e1lvez says the water needed to irrigate Castilla-La Mancha\u2019s vines, olives, pistachios, onions and melons exceeds available resources and short of a run of several years of heavy rain, the wetland can only be saved by transferring water from the Tagus river \u2013 except the Tagus is overexploited and almost dried up four years ago.\nMuch of the problem dates from the 1970s, when the Spanish government embarked on a plan to turn Murcia and Almer\u00eda in the south-east into Europe\u2019s market garden. The plan had one major flaw: there was no water.\nSpain\u2019s south-east is arid and none of the country\u2019s three major rivers flows near it. The Douro and Tagus both rise in north-central Spain and flow west into the Atlantic at, respectively, Porto and Lisbon, while the Ebro rises in the north-west and empties into the Mediterranean nearly 400km (250 miles) north of Murcia.\nThe solution was to transfer water from the headwaters of the Tagus through almost 300km of pipeline to irrigate the barren south.\nHowever, rather than satisfy demand, the transfer has served to incentivise unsustainable intensive agriculture that has led to the exploitation of groundwater, with disastrous environmental consequences.\nThe spectacle this summer of thousands of dead fish floating in the Mar Menor, a saltwater lagoon in Murcia once known for its crystal-clear waters, was the result of fertiliser polluting the groundwater that drains into the sea. The nitrates trigger vast algae blooms that deprive the fish of oxygen.\n\u201cThe Mar Menor disaster is the result of intensive agriculture which continues to expand in a manner that isn\u2019t sustainable, both in Murcia and in many other parts of Spain,\u201d says Mart\u00ednez-Fern\u00e1ndez.\nNeighbouring Almer\u00eda \u2013 where the greenhouses making up the famous \u201csea of plastic\u201d are visible from space \u2013 produces an estimated 3.5m tonnes of peppers, tomatoes, cucumber and melons a year. Together with Granada, it supplies about 50% of the European market. Every year Almer\u00eda also produces thousands of tonnes of plastic waste, much of which ends up in the sea.\nThe Tagus water transfer is not enough to meet the growing demands of agriculture in Almer\u00eda, however. Over the past 40 years the amount of water that reaches the Tagus headwaters has fallen by about 40% according to estimates, and is continuing to fall. So Almer\u00eda is increasingly reliant on desalinated seawater for irrigation.\nIn an attempt to deal with the problem, in 1985 the Spanish government brought in a new water law to regulate its use. But it was forced to concede that anyone who had a well or access to water had the right to exploit it.\nToday, the government recognises that the situation is unsustainable. Teresa Ribera, minister for ecological transition, is under pressure for Spain to conform to European standards on water quality and quantity that come into force in 2027, and knows this can only be achieved by reducing irrigation.\nIn presenting the country\u2019s five-year water plan, Ribera recognised that water resources are in decline and parts of Spain face desertification.\n\u201cIn this context, water plans can\u2019t continue to support the sort of practices that have led to the overexploitation of aquifers, the contamination of groundwater and the deterioration of our rivers,\u201d she said.\nAlthough agriculture only accounts for about 3% of GDP and 4% of jobs, the farming industry has considerable political clout. When Ribera announced reductions in the amount of water that could be transferred from the Tagus, there was an outcry from farmers.\nLucas Jim\u00e9nez, president of an association of farmers that depend on the transfer, warned Ribera \u201cfaces a battle in the courts and in the streets\u201d.\n\u201cThe problem is that the solution to the water issue will put any government in conflict with numerous sectors such as agriculture, hydroelectricity and property developers,\u201d says Miguel \u00c1ngel S\u00e1nchez, a spokesperson for the Platform in Defence of the Tagus.\n\u201cMadrid knows this can\u2019t go on, but they won\u2019t take the bull by the horns and it\u2019s the regional governments that have authority over water,\u201d says Gos\u00e1lvez.\nHe says the EU\u2019s common agriculture policy is partly to blame for encouraging intensive farming that is both environmentally damaging and wasteful, leading farmers to dump produce to maintain prices.\n\u201cThe EU pays farmers to plant more, leading to overproduction with the result that the market price barely covers the cost of production,\u201d he says.\n\u201cWe need to wake up to reality, there is simply not enough water to meet the demand for irrigation. The farmers are digging their own graves.\u201d\nFind more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",

It\u2019s come slowly and given us enough time to prepare,\u201d Robin Rolfe said.\nThe water was lapping at their property, Torig Park, where it would already have entered if it wasn\u2019t for their levy and the initial layer of sandbagging they had set down.\nThe couple planned to stay at their place, as they did in 2012. They said every flood was different and flood was very different to fire.\n\u201cWhat happens with water is water divides and fire unites. If there\u2019s a big fire here, everybody pulls together but when it\u2019s water it\u2019s a totally different situation,\u201d Warwick Rolfe said.\n\u201cPeople put up banks and it upsets people because it takes the water in different directions and channels the water one way so it can\u2019t spread over the landscape.\u201d\nResidents in low-lying areas were given until 9.30pm on Tuesday to evacuate.\nBarry Griffiths, the zone deputy commander, southern zone for the SES, said flooding around the southern sections of Forbes was a guarantee.\n\u201cThe question mark is around whether or not the water itself will move up through the town centre,\u201d Griffiths said.\nIn 2012, when the water level was 10.55 metres, Griffiths said it went through town. But in 2016, when the water was higher at 10.65, it did not go through the centre.\nSign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter\n\u201cWe\u2019re confident we\u2019re going to get 10.65, but how it gets there, when it gets there, really the flood\u2019s going to make that decision for us,\u201d Griffiths said.\nAccording to Griffiths, \u201cthe biggest concern is the issue of potential flood rescues and people staying in their homes and not heeding to our warnings\u201d.\n\u201cWe know there are a number of people who\u2019ve indicated to us that they\u2019re not going to move.\u201d\nThe Forbes SES unit commander, Robert \u201cRoc\u201d Walshaw, said preparations had been ongoing since Forbes experienced a minor flood in September.\nAs the peak of the flood approached, Walshaw said the river was rising steadily, about 4cm an hour.\nWalshaw said most of the people in the low-lying affected areas had already done the sandbagging to protect their property, which had come off the back of a massive effort that had seen volunteers working \u201cconstantly until six or seven o\u2019clock at night\u201d.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been getting truckloads [of sand] every day, that\u2019s how much we\u2019re going through,\u201d Walshaw said.\nForbes had seen approximately 100 SES volunteers in addition to the same number of community volunteers.\n\u201cThey\u2019re enjoying themselves because they\u2019re doing something for their community.

As thousands of Afghans stormed the city\u2019s international airport, desperate to leave the country, Mirzaee was diverted to a flight to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv \u2013 this time as a passenger.\n\u201cIt was dark when we took off, that\u2019s all I remember,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was a rollercoaster of emotions because everything happened so quickly. I couldn\u2019t believe Kabul had fallen. When I left my house in the morning and said goodbye to my family, I couldn\u2019t have imagined that by evening time, I\u2019d be permanently leaving home.\n\u201cI saw my country crumbling,\u201d she recalls.\nJust months earlier, Mirzaee had made headlines as one of the pilots of a Kam Air Boeing 737 \u2013 the country\u2019s first flight with an all-female crew.\n\u201cIt was a huge accomplishment for Afghanistan and for the male-dominated aviation industry in general,\u201d says Mirzaee. She believed then that change within the country\u2019s conservative society was possible, and that she and the airline would be part of it.\nBut when the Taliban established an all-male government that saw hundreds of women removed from their jobs, Mirzaee says she was robbed of her hopes for the future.\n\u201cAfghan women have done amazingly over the past decades. We\u2019ve used any opportunities given to us. We fought for our rights and scored big achievements. I was hopeful that a window had opened. I was approached by many young women who also dreamed of becoming a pilot,\u201d Mirzaee says.\n\u201cWith the Taliban takeover, it all disappeared. They are the same barbaric group they have been in the past and they want to silence women. If I give up on my passion, they have achieved their goal.\u201d\nMirzaee attended Kabul\u2019s Afghan-Turk Maarif school but finished her final year in Port Colborne in Canada, where she first considered a career in aviation.\nShe stayed in Canada for another year after her studies, working as a cashier and barista to scrape the money together for flying lessons.\n\u201cMy flight instructor told me, \u2018you have control, so fly the plane\u2019 before taking off on my first ever flight. I was nervous, but I also felt free. I figured, if I can get a plane into the sky, I can do anything,\u201d she says.\nBack in Afghanistan, Mirzaee talked to airlines to see if she could continue her training, but they all initially said no. \u201cI kept annoying them,\u201d she laughs.\n\u201cKam Air, one of Afghanistan\u2019s carriers, decided to give me a chance \u2013 and I took it very seriously.\u201d\nShe became Afghanistan\u2019s first female commercial airline pilot in September last year, flying to Turkey, Saudi Arabia and India.\nMirzaee was able to travel to Bulgaria on a pre-existing visa. It has just expired and she has been advised to claim asylum.\nHer mother and sisters were also evacuated from Afghanistan, flying to Albania on the same day an explosions ripped through the crowds outside Kabul airport, killing almost 200 people and injuring hundreds more.\nMost of her friends are now scattered across the globe.\n\u201cWhen I was studying, my mum always told me to come back to Afghanistan and work for my country. I shared her conviction. But today, even though I\u2019d like to go back, I can\u2019t. There is no space for women like me in Afghanistan any more. I lost my job, my home, my crew \u2013 everything.\u201d\nBut she says: \u201cI\u2019m hoping another airline will give me a chance to continue my career. A lot has been taken from me, but I will fight for my passion. That is what makes me, me.\u201d\nSign up for a different view with our Global Dispatch newsletter \u2013 a roundup of our top stories from around the world, recommended reads, and thoughts from our team on key development and human rights issues, delivered to your inbox every two weeks:",

        "content": "The artist discusses her role in an eye-opening new documentary that trails the history of LGBTQ+ comic books and the people behind them\nAmong other things, the story of LGBTQ+ liberation is a story of spaces. For as long as the LGBTQ+ community has sought freedom and equality, it has been essential for this group to have places both concrete and metaphorical where they can safely gather, emote, care for one another and understand their identities.\nThose spaces have not always been so easy to find, and creativity has been essential. No Straight Lines: The Rise of Queer Comics, the Peabody award-winning film-maker Vivian Kleiman\u2019s latest documentary, is about how comics became a site in the struggle for queer people to have room to exist. It tells how a foundational generation of artists, including Howard Cruse, Mary Wings, Jennifer Camper and Rupert Kinnard, fought against censorship of their very existence by creating and distributing their own comics in the 1960s and 70s. It then follows that story down through the generations, integrating the careers of later creators like Alison Bechdel and the Gen Z artists who are again redefining how the LGBTQ+ comics world looks and where it is found.\n\u201cI\u2019m amazed about how much material is in the film,\u201d said Bechdel, whose New York Times bestselling 2006 graphic novel Fun Home was adapted into a Tony Award\u2013winning Broadway musical. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly about this generational transmission and the political changes that have happened over the past 40 years or so. [It\u2019s] a generational story about recent progress.\u201d\nNo Straight Lines starts in the 1950s, when gay and lesbian artists found that censorship made it impossible to tell their stories in the comics section of newspapers. Cruse, whose groundbreaking 80s series Wendell was one of the first to speak to the Aids crisis, explains how prestige venues like newspapers and newsstands self-censored via the Comics Code Authority, explicitly forbidding any mention of homosexuality. According to Cruse, this made the comics world into a \u201cbland\u201d space of cis-het individuals that subscribed to heavily binary, limited ideas regarding gender roles and sexuality.\nSo-called underground comics rode in on the countercultural revolution of the 60s, priming the 70s to be a transformational decade. The pioneering artist Mary Wings explains how the lackluster representation of a lesbian coming out in the 1972 Wimmen\u2019s Comix anthology inspired her to tell a more authentic story in her groundbreaking Come Out Comix. Self-printed and self-distributed by Wings, it was noteworthy for being the first to portray a lesbian protagonist as a fully fleshed out human being, as opposed to just a sexualized object.\nAs Kleiman introduces these foundational stories, she intersperses the words of contemporary comics artists like Meggie Ramm, who explains that \u201cI was just so grateful that these people had come before and had helped me get to the point where I am today where I can make comics about being a queer person and have people acknowledge them and take them seriously.\u201d Throughout, Kleiman structures the film so that it feels like a series of intricate, intimate conversations across the generations, resulting in a rich tapestry of interwoven voices and images. Commenting on this aesthetic, she said: \u201cIn film-making I try to construct a simulated conversation among the different people that I\u2019m including in the film. When it works it\u2019s really quite dynamic.\u201d\nThroughout the interplay of voices, No Straight Lines begins to answer a central question: why have comics become such a powerful site for queer culture? Ineluctably, the documentary finds itself again and again returning to one answer to this question: comics have a remarkable capacity to provide a space for self-definition that many in the LGBTQ+ community do not otherwise possess in their day-to-day life.\n\u201cWhen I got started as a cartoonist in the early 1980s,\u201d said Bechdel, \u201cI was conscious of it as a form that nobody was going to criticize, and that just gave me a great sense of freedom and possibility. It\u2019s just really super accessible, not only in the ways it can be distributed but in the ways it\u2019s assimilated, the ways we read it, the ways we ingest these words and images.\u201d\nNo Straight Lines is a testament to how, with just ink and paper, LGBTQ+ artists can envision profoundly validating bodies, identities and relationships that often have no space in the cis-het world. Kleiman\u2019s cornucopia of images from the strips themselves lets viewers experience first-hand the very idiosyncratic, forceful presences that these artworks conjure in the minds of readers.\nA notable example of the power of these comics is the story of Rupert Kinnard, a Black, disabled artist who began his career telling the story of his protagonist, the Brown Bomber, in the pages of Cornell\u2019s student newspaper. Seemingly without even intending it it, Kinnard discovered that when he made his Brown Bomber come out, it became entwined with his own coming out, elegantly making the case for the substantial impact that queer comics can make in the lives of those who participate in them. As Kinnard narrates his story, Kleiman leads us around the mostly black squares of the strip with which he and his character came out, artfully popping in text and images in conversation with Kinnard\u2019s voice.\nNo Straight Lines is also a story of media. It begins with queer voices on the outside of the mainstream media of the 50s and 60s, then shows how they eventually made their own media through self-printed publications and the rise of LGBTQ+ newspapers, then portrays how the scene had to remake everything all over again as those LGBTQ+ newspapers began to disappear and the web became ascendant. Bechdel\u2019s story is instructive: her long-running Dykes to Watch out for was originally carried in the alt-paper Funny Times and syndicated in queer newspapers, but as it became increasingly difficult to stay afloat financially in that format, she was forced to embrace the graphic novel form. This transition proved to be the beginning of a major new chapter in her career, as the resultant book Fun Home broke through barriers to become a smash success and bring her stories to entirely new audiences.\n\u201cI feel hopeful when I saw the young people that [Kleiman] talked to for this movie,\u201d said Bechdel. \u201cI didn\u2019t know until I saw the show that there\u2019s this whole strand of younger artists. That really does make me hopeful. I feel like I have some kind of connection to these younger people, and that is really pleasant as someone who doesn\u2019t really have that in a familial way.\u201d\nIf the documentary ends on a high note \u2013 with testaments to the community that exists in the queer comics world and the openings it creates for complexity and different ways of being \u2013 the entire film evokes the special way that generations of creators have intermingled in this space, trading inspiration and gratitude. \u201cThe thing that surprised me when I interviewed the young people,\u201d said Kleiman, \u201cwas how grateful they were to the pioneers of queer comics. They were totally recognizing the struggles of the prior generations and including that sensitivity and awareness in their own consciousness.\u201d\nNo Straight Lines: The Rise of Queer Comics is playing at the Laemmle Glendale in Los Angeles now and will be touring festivals globally before a wider release",

        "content": "Forty-five residents at the facility died from coronavirus and five more died from neglect as staff fell ill \nThe first person infected with Covid linked to the St Basil\u2019s aged care home outbreak in which 50 residents died has spoken publicly for the first time, telling a coroner she was cleared to work despite living in a high-risk suburb with relatives experiencing \u201cthroat discomfort\u201d.\nThe former personal care assistant at the home, identified only as \u201cA\u201d to protect her identity, said she was swabbed on 5 July 2020 at a drive-through testing clinic after she finished a shift at St Basil\u2019s.\nShe was tested with her husband, sister-in-law, brother-in-law and sister, as they all lived together in Moreland, an area the Victorian government had identified as high risk for Covid-19. All five were asymptomatic at the time, A told the coroner on Tuesday.\nShe said staff who tested her knew she worked in aged care and told her because she was asymptomatic she could go to work.\nWhile she was not rostered on to work the following two days on 6 and 7 July, she told a registered nurse at St Basil\u2019s, Jagmeet Nagra, on 7 July that two of her family members were starting to experience \u201cthroat discomfort\u201d. None of the five had yet received their test result. At the time, Victoria was experiencing a second wave of the virus leading to delays in test results being returned.\nEarlier on Tuesday, Nagra confirmed to the court that she informed A she could come to work since she and her relatives were not displaying symptoms such as high temperature, runny nose, or cough. Nagra said this advice was also in line with the policy for staff at St Basil\u2019s. Nagra broke down crying towards the end of her evidence after being questioned for almost three hours about infection control procedures at the home.\nAt the time, Victoria department of health and human services guidelines stated only those living in a high-risk area or displaying fever or chills, or acute respiratory infection, should get tested for Covid. People without symptoms should not be tested except in special circumstances, the advice stated, such as if they were a recovered case returning to work in a high-risk setting.\nThe care assistant A next worked at St Basil\u2019s on 8 July, still asymptomatic and without her test result. But she said she received a text message from her husband during her shift which said her sister-in-law\u2019s Covid test was positive.\n\u201cStraight away I packed my bag and came to my manager, put a mask on and explained everything \u2026 she sent me home so I could stay in isolation,\u201d A told the court.\nOn 9 July, A received her test result which confirmed she had the virus. She texted and called the facility manager at St Basil\u2019s, Vicky Kos, to tell her. Kos will give evidence to the inquest in the coming weeks.\n\u201cShe said to me \u2026 you have to now stay in 14 days\u2019 isolation. The department of health will contact you every day,\u201d A said.\nShe disputed a statement from another St Basil\u2019s staff member who said at the end of her shift on 5 July, A told other staff her family members had started to experience sore throats. A denied this and said she never experienced any symptoms \u2013 even after testing positive.\nBy the time A finished her isolation period, the virus had swept through the home leading to all staff being furloughed and replaced by agency staff in an attempt to contain the spread. A did not return to work at the home for about three months for this reason.\nOn Monday, the inquest heard there was an eight-day delay between A\u2019s positive test result being reported to the state health department and the testing of all residents at the home. Guidelines recommended testing occur within four to six hours.\nA specialist emergency physician Dr Ian Norton, who provided the coroner with a report into the home, said this delay was a \u201croot cause\u201d of the virus sweeping through the home.\nChristine Golding, whose mother, Efraxia Tsalanidis, died after contracting the virus at the home, spoke of the \u201cinhumane neglect\u201d her mother experienced prior to her death due to staff being under-resourced and overwhelmed by sick patients. She recounted going to the home with other family members and banging on the doors of the home, desperate for managers to give them information.\nThroughout July and August 2020, 94 residents and 94 staff members were infected. While 45 residents died from Covid-19, a further five died from neglect during the same period as the workforce succumbed to the virus and gaps were revealed in infection control, the court heard.\nOver five weeks the coroner will examine how St Basil\u2019s management and staff and the state and federal governments prepared for Covid in aged care; their responses when it hit; the timeliness of information provided to staff, residents and families; whether the state and federal governments coordinated their response to the outbreak appropriately; and the adequacy of the replacement workforce deployed to St Basil\u2019s, among other issues.\nThe inquest continues.",

        "content": "Analysis: End of furlough has not driven up unemployment, but issues such as low productivity still exist\nAfter a bruising couple of weeks, the government was in need of some good news and that was provided by the latest jobless figures. Fears that the end of the furlough scheme would lead to rising unemployment have proved groundless.\nIt is, of course, early days. There are still only flash estimates of what happened in October once the Treasury\u2019s wage subsidies had come to an end but the signs are promising.\nBut rather than the expected surge in redundancies as firms had to cope without government financial support, there was a 160,000 rise in the number of payrolled employees. In the three months from August to October the number of job vacancies hit a new record of close to 1.2m \u2013 up almost 400,000 on the pre-pandemic level.\nThe Office for National Statistics said in the July to September period \u2013 the months leading up to the scrapping of the furlough \u2013 the number of people moving from job to job was higher than ever before, but this was the result of choice rather than people being forced to move because they had been dismissed.\nRishi Sunak said the figures were tribute to the \u201cextraordinary success\u201d of the furlough and few would dispute that claim. The unemployment rate fell by 0.5 percentage points to 4.3% in the three months to September and is only marginally higher than it was when Covid-19 arrived in early 2020.\nSome of the workers who came off furlough in October may have gone into part-time rather than full-time jobs, but even so the labour market has shown resilience throughout the pandemic.\nAndrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, said on Monday that he wanted to see what was happening to employment post-furlough before deciding whether to support higher interest rates. Nothing in the official data suggests the City is wrong in its belief that borrowing costs will rise from 0.1% to 0.25% next month.\nIndeed, the economy as a whole is now starting to go post-Covid. The inflation figures due out on Wednesday will still show the impact of the virus on global energy prices and on supply chains but in other respects it is as if the past 18 months never happened.\nThere are two sides to that. The good news is that the labour market has emerged relatively unscathed. The bad news is that the problems of February 2020 \u2013 low investment, low productivity, weak underlying growth \u2013 are problems that remain to be tackled in November 2021.",

The hospital is close to Liverpool cathedral, where a Remembrance Sunday event was taking place.\nHinds said there was a shift towards attacks becoming more self-directed. \u201cWe use the term \u2018lone wolf\u2019 a lot, sometimes it\u2019s a bit \u2026 it can be a little misleading because it gives a certain picture of an individual,\u201d he told Sky News on Tuesday.\n\u201cBut it certainly is true that we\u2019ve seen a move over time, a shift from these what we call directed attacks, part of a bigger organisation where people are following instructions, sometimes quite complex in their organisation, and move from that to more self-directed, some self-radicalised individuals or small groups, rarely totally, totally alone.\u201d\nAsked if it was right to lower the terror threat in February, Hinds said the decisions were taken independently. \u201cBut whether we talk about \u2018substantial\u2019 or \u2018severe\u2019, the threat level has been high for a long time now. As long as that is the case, there is of course the risk that a terrible event and atrocities such as this can happen,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s necessary to be alert throughout. I think it\u2019s right that the level has now been raised and these things are kept under constant review.\u201d\nThe shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, said the government needed to launch a judge-led inquiry into \u201clone wolf\u201d individuals to understand how better to prevent attacks.\n\u201cI previously called, after the terrible stabbings that occurred in Forbury Gardens in Reading [Khairi Saadallah was found guilty of three murders and given a whole life sentence] that we needed specifically to be looking at the issue of lone actors,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know the specific conclusions in the case in Liverpool yet as to whether someone was acting alone or in concert, and I\u2019m not for a moment drawing that conclusion too prematurely.\n\u201cBut I do think we need to be looking at the attacks that have taken place. Do we need something like a judge-led inquiry to look at the issue of lone attackers? And we need now, as I say, to get this investigation concluded as swiftly as possible, and then to look at the wider conclusions that perhaps we need to draw.\u201d\nThe man killed in Liverpool was not previously known to MI5, which keeps a list of 3,000 current suspects and just over 20,000 previous suspects, or to specialist counter-terrorism police officers.\nThe dead man, who police believe built the improvised explosive device, is thought not to be British-born and to have had Syrian and Iraqi heritage. His status in the UK is under investigation, as is his time spent at a privately run asylum seeker hostel in Liverpool.\nThe threat level had been at the lower level since 8 February after a \u201csignificant reduction\u201d in the momentum of attacks in Europe, including those seen in Austria and France between September and November 2020.\nAnnouncing on Monday that the attack level would be raised, the home secretary, Priti Patel, said this was because there had been two attacks \u2013 Liverpool and the murder of MP David Amess \u2013 in the space of a month.",

And yet, Timmaraju sees reason for optimism.\n\u201cIt can be the bleakest of times and it can be terribly scary,\u201d she said. \u201cIt can also be an incredible opportunity.\u201d\nEarlier this month, the supreme court took up two separate challenges to a Texas law effectively banning abortions in the second most populous state in the nation. But the more direct threat to Roe comes on 1 December, when the court will consider the constitutionality of a Mississippi law that bans abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy \u2013 about two months earlier than Roe and subsequent decisions allow.\nThese are the first abortion cases to be considered by the expanded, 6-3 conservative majority, which includes three appointees of Donald Trump, who had promised to nominate only \u201cpro-life\u201d justices.\nIf Roe were to be overturned, there are 26 states that are \u201ccertain or likely\u201d to ban the procedure, according to the Guttmacher Institute. The list includes nine states with abortion bans still on the books from before Roe, and 12 states with so-called \u201ctrigger\u201d laws, which would be enacted if Roe is overturned.\n\u201cWith Scotus in mind and with the midterms at play,\u201d Timmaraju said, \u201cwe have a real opportunity to wake up a big majority of the electorate that we know supports reproductive freedom and double down and ramp up that work to meet the moment we\u2019re facing right now, this moment of crisis.\u201d\nTimmaraju, the daughter of immigrants from India, is the first woman of color to lead the organization, which is one of the nation\u2019s oldest and most powerful abortion advocacy groups.\nMost recently, she worked as a senior adviser for the Biden administration on diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility. In 2016, she led efforts to mobilize female voters as a director for Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign. She also led diversity efforts at Comcast Corporation, held leadership roles with Planned Parenthood and served as the national director of the National Council of Asian Pacific Americans.\n\u201cI feel like I\u2019ve been at the intersection of race and gender my whole career,\u201d she said.\nTimmaraju said it was time to \u201craise the alarm\u201d on the \u201cvery organized, concerted effort by the extremist right to whittle away at reproductive rights since the minute Roe became law of the land\u201d.\nExposing these tactics, she believes, will help energize voters, especially those who support abortion rights but may not have realized the extent to which abortion access is under threat, particularly at the state and local level.\nAt the federal level, she called for the immediate passage of the Women\u2019s Health Protection Act, which would effectively codify Roe and counter state-level restrictions on abortion. The House passed the bill in September, but it faces daunting odds in the Senate, where a Republican filibuster awaits.\nNaral has been outspoken in calling on Democrats to eliminate the filibuster, which requires 60 votes to pass most legislation.\nYet it\u2019s unclear the legislation would pass with just a simple majority, as two Democratic senators, Joe Manchin and Bob Casey, have not yet signed on to a Senate version of the bill. Nor have the two pro-choice Republican senators, Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins.\nNevertheless, Chuck Schumer, the Senate majority leader, has promised to bring the measure to the floor for a vote \u2013 a sign, Democrats believe, that abortion could be a potent issue in next year\u2019s election.\nIn her new role, Timmaraju hopes to build on the solidarity between progressive organizations, leveraging their collective power to resist the tide of abortion restrictions and voting rights restrictions, while fighting for LGBTQ rights and climate justice.\n\u201cWe know there\u2019s a throughline of white supremacy throughout,\u201d she said. \u201cThese are not new playbooks.\u201d\nFurthermore, she said that overturning Roe would have a disproportionate impact on people of color, low-income people and people who live in rural areas, all of whom already experience higher barriers to accessing reproductive and maternal health services.\nDespite the myriad political and legal setbacks, she said the reproductive rights movement has made critical gains.\nAbortion is no longer a \u201ctaboo\u201d topic, Timmaraju said, crediting the decades of work by activists and a new generation of female lawmakers who have publicly shared the story of their decision to have an abortion.\n\u201cWe need to not be afraid of talking about it. When we become afraid or we get, you know, uncomfortable with it,\u201d she said, \u201cthat\u2019s when we give all this opportunity for our opponents to push and spread misinformation.\u201d\nTimmaraju said pro-choice advocates must be prepared to forcefully counter attempts by anti-abortion activists to portray the fall of Roe as \u201creasonable\u201d, by pointing to medical advances or the availability of birth control, for example.\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to downplay it,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve got to be very ready to say, absolutely not.\u201d\nWhile the nation awaits a ruling from the supreme court next year, Timmaraju\u2019s message to the movement is to keep the faith.\n\u201cWe may have some short-term losses \u2013 and we\u2019re gonna fight like hell to avoid them,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we also have some really significant long-term gains, the seeds [of which] are being planted now.\u201d",

O\u2019Farrell, who died in 2016 from muscular dystrophy (with which he was diagnosed as a child), had been the lead singer in a cult band called Interference, who never quite made it big back in the late 1980s/early 90s.\nYou could posit all sorts of reasons for his lack of success, such as the fact that record companies were hesitant to sign an act whose front man was in a wheelchair, or that there was just too much competition in the rammed Dublin music scene at a time, when everyone thought they could be the next U2. Or perhaps \u2013 whisper it \u2013 it\u2019s because the music isn\u2019t all that great. O\u2019Farrell certainly had a belter of a voice, and it\u2019s touching to see him performing in his heyday when he was a strikingly handsome fellow with a hideous mullet. But there were scads of bands around at the time who could play and sing just as well, and O\u2019Farrell\u2019s songwriting was, to be generous, rather hit and miss. O\u2019Farrell was also apparently a perfectionist who could never quite finish things, a point illustrated in the footage here of him finessing the same songs over and over again with friends and bandmates in his home studio for a second album he\u2019s never satisfied with.\nNevertheless, he had one huge hit with Gold, a tune he wrote in the 1990s but which he sings beautifully in an affecting scene in the 2007 film Once. That romantic drama starred O\u2019Farrell\u2019s old friend Glen Hansard as a struggling Dublin musician who meets a Czech flower seller (Mark\u00e9ta Irglov\u00e1); the film went on to be a worldwide dark-horse hit, spawning a stage musical and many live performances, not least for O\u2019Farrell, who made it to Radio City Music Hall in Manhattan to perform for a career-high moment.\n Breaking Out is released on 19 November in cinemas.",

Plus, the world\u2019s first \u2018TikTopera\u2019\nGood morning.\nDuring a virtual summit China\u2019s president told Joe Biden that China was prepared to take \u201cdecisive measures\u201d if Taiwan made any moves towards independence that crossed Beijing\u2019s red lines.\nXi Jinping also warned Biden that any support for Taiwanese independence would be \u201clike playing with fire\u201d, according to a Chinese state media account of the summit, adding that \u201cthose who play with fire will get burned\u201d.\nThe language represented stock Chinese nationalist rhetoric, given extra potency by being delivered in person at the most extensive talks to date between the two leaders.\nIn response, Biden said the US remained committed to the \u201cone-China policy\u201d that recognises only one sovereign Chinese state, and that Washington \u201cstrongly opposes unilateral efforts to change the status quo or undermine peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait\u201d.\nWas the rest of the conversation tense? No: in fact, the overall cordial tone of the video conference exchange, with Xi referring to Biden at one point as \u201cmy old friend\u201d, gave an immediate boost to financial markets in Asia.\nWhat did Biden want to achieve? One of his aims in the summit was to establish regular dialogue between US and Chinese officials on a range of issues. It was unclear how far the two leaders had gone to achieve that, however.\nThe conspiracy theorist Alex Jones was found liable on Monday for damages in lawsuits brought by parents of children killed in the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting, over Jones\u2019s claim the massacre was a hoax.\nTwenty first-grade children, aged five and six, and six adults were killed in the shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012. The 20-year-old gunman killed his mother before the shooting and killed himself as police arrived at the school.\nThe shooting was portrayed on Jones\u2019s Infowars show as a hoax involving actors, aimed at increasing gun control. Jones has since acknowledged the shooting did occur.\nFamilies of victims said they had been subjected to harassment and death threats from Jones\u2019s followers because of the hoax conspiracy broadcast on Infowars. They sued Jones and his companies in courts in Connecticut and Texas, for defamation and infliction of emotional distress.\nAlex Jones was, in a rare step, defaulted by Judge Barbara Bellis for his and his companies\u2019 failure to disclose information related to the defamation suit.\nThe default means the judge found in favor of the parents and will hold a hearing on how much damages Jones should pay.\nThe British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell will come face-to-face with prospective jurors for her Manhattan federal court sex trafficking trial on Tuesday, as jury selection begins in earnest.\nFifty potential panelists are expected to appear in the New York courtroom to answer questions.\nThe process is meant to filter out possible jurors who might hold biases that could favor the defense or prosecution. Roughly 600 people completed pre-screening questionnaires earlier this month; of those, prosecutors and defense attorneys agreed that 231 should proceed to jury selection.\nMaxwell, 59, was arrested in July 2020 at a secretive, luxury estate in the small New Hampshire town of Bradford. She was charged with sexual offences, conspiracy and perjury related to the actions of the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein, who killed himself in a New York jail cell while awaiting sex trafficking charges.\nWhat is she accused of? Maxwell \u201cplayed a critical role in helping Epstein to identify, befriend and groom minor victims\u201d and \u201cin some cases, Maxwell participated in the abuse\u201d, Audrey Strauss, then the acting Manhattan US attorney, said after Maxwell\u2019s arrest.\nBiden has signed his hard-fought $1tn infrastructure deal into law before a bipartisan, celebratory crowd on the White House lawn, declaring that the infusion of cash for roads, bridges, ports and more would make life \u201cchange for the better\u201d.\nThe president hopes to use the infrastructure law to build back his popularity, which has taken a hit amid rising inflation and the inability to fully shake the public health and economic risks from Covid-19.\n\u201cMy message to the American people is this: America is moving again and your life is going to change for the better,\u201d he said.\nHowever, the prospects are tougher for further bipartisanship ahead of the 2022 midterm elections as Biden pivots back to more difficult negotiations over his broader $1.85tn social spending package.\nThe $1.2n infrastructure bill cleared the Senate 69-13 with Republican support, but scraped through the House last week with just 13 Republican votes \u2013 who have been called \u201ctraitors\u201d by members of the party.\nThe deadlock over part two of Biden\u2019s agenda, known as Build Back Better, is not helping his approval rating, hovering around the 40% mark despite jobs growth.\nProsecutors and defense attorneys delivered closing statements in the murder trial of Kyle Rittenhouse, the 18-year-old who has been charged with homicide after fatally shooting two men during racial justice protests last August in Kenosha, Wisconsin.\nThe Wyoming Republican party will no longer recognize Liz Cheney as a member of the GOP in a rebuke over her vote to impeach Donald Trump over his role in the 6 January insurrection.

The National Weather Service warned that winds nearing hurricane strength were possible in the region, which has had nearly ceaseless rain for about a week. More than 158,000 customers were without power in western Washington at one point on Monday, the Seattle Times reported and less than halfway into the month it is already the third-wettest November that Seattle has recorded in more than a century.

Before declining, they said they had several online discussions with the museum, agreeing which items would be suitable and how they would be delivered.\n\u201cWe stand by our claim that the Science Museum contacted us for items to be placed in the permanent record,\u201d said Dee. \u201cBut in the end we declined because we were unhappy with the museum\u2019s relationship with Shell and Adani and its treatment of climate protesters.\u201d\nIn particular, the scientists were concerned with a clause in its contract with Shell that prevents the museum from \u201cdamaging the goodwill or reputation\u201d of the oil giant.\n\u201cOne is left to assume the Science Museum is now telling the \u2018truth as best we are allowed\u2019,\u201d said Steve Allen.\nThe scientists\u2019 decision is the latest blow to the institution over its relationship with fossil fuel companies. In October, the leading climate scientist professor Chris Rapley, a former director of the Science Museum, resigned from its advisory board saying he disagreed with its \u201congoing willingness to accept oil and gas company sponsorship\u201d.\nLater that month, two trustees \u2013 Hannah Fry, a professor in the mathematics of cities at University College London, and Jo Foster, the director of the UK charity the Institute for Research in Schools \u2013 resigned from the museum\u2019s board in protest at its deal with Adani.\nFry said the Science Museum was \u201cgiving the false impression that scientists believe the current efforts of fossil fuel companies are sufficient to avoid disaster\u201d.\nThere have also been several protests at the museum, most recently when youth activists occupied it overnight.\nThe Allens said they were initially honoured to be asked for their work \u2013 which has included pivotal studies into the extent and impact of plastic pollution \u2013 in the museum\u2019s archive, but added that when they looked into its relationships with fossil fuel companies they felt they could not go ahead.\n\u201cWe felt that their impartiality has been compromised,\u201d said Steve Allen. He dismissed the Science Museum\u2019s claim that no formal offer to include their work had been made.\n\u201cIt really doesn\u2019t matter what they say, it only matters how their actions are perceived by us in the scientific community, and the public.

The report identified 48 casualties in total.\nThe leaked report described the incident as a \u201cmassacre\u201d, said most of the army officers deployed to the toll gate were \u201cnot fit and proper to serve\u201d, and recommended prosecuting certain policemen for their actions.\n\u201cAt the Lekki toll gate, officers of the Nigerian army shot, injured and killed unarmed helpless and defenceless protesters, without provocation or justification, while they were waving the Nigerian flag and singing the national anthem, and the manner of assault and killing could in context be described as a massacre,\u201d the report said.\nThe contents of the report have not been confirmed by the state government, but a figure involved in the inquiry confirmed to the Guardian that it was submitted to the Lagos government on Monday.\nIt is the clearest admission yet at the official level that security forces killed unarmed protesters, following a year of denials and contradictory theories offered by Nigerian government ministers, the army and the police.\nMany thousands of mostly young Nigerians took to the streets in \u201cEndSars\u201d protests across several cities last year, demonstrating against the infamously brutal Special Anti-Robbery Squad (Sars) unit, and then more widely, against police brutality and bad governance.\nProtests across the country were met with extreme force by security agencies, including at the Lekki toll gate, where protesters livestreamed footage on Instagram showing live rounds being shot and demonstrators with bullet wounds.\nAmnesty International said at least 12 people were killed, including at another protest in Ikeja, Lagos.\nIn the aftermath of the killings, Nigeria\u2019s attorney general, Abubakar Malami, said the livestreams were likely to have been manipulated and said \u201choodlums\u201d wearing army fatigues could have been at the scene. The country\u2019s information minister, Lai Mohammed, described the incident as \u201ca massacre without bodies\u201d.\nThe 300-page report by the judicial inquiry found that the army came to the scene at the request of Lagos\u2019 governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, who also set up the inquiry.\nThe report said incomplete CCTV footage of that night, provided by the Lekki Concession Company, was manipulated before being presented at the inquiry.\nOfficers involved in the atrocities should be prosecuted and state authorities should provide a public apology, the report said.\nAs the demonstrations intensified last year, the government officially disbanded the Sars police unit, and many states initiated judicial inquiries into police abuses. Yet despite the reforms, Sars officers accused of violence have not been held to account but moved into other parts of the police infrastructure.\nSanwo-Olu vowed a \u201cproper response\u201d to the panel\u2019s recommendations, adding that a \u201cwhite paper\u201d would be published within the next two weeks.\n\u201cThis process will help us start the very difficult process of proper reconciliation, restitution, bringing together of anyone \u2026 affected,\u201d Sanwo-Olu said.",

        "content": "Bill set to pass parliament later this week but Labor\u2019s Harriet Shing says heated protests have led MPs and staff to \u2018second guess their security\u2019\nOpponents of the Victorian government\u2019s controversial pandemic powers legislation have called for the bill to be delayed in the upper house, warning that protests outside parliament will grow.\nDebate in the Legislative Council ran into Tuesday night and was expected to continue late into the week, with opponents vowing to scrutinise the bill line by line.\nEleventh-hour discussions with key crossbenchers mean the legislation \u2013 which gives the premier and health minister the power to declare a pandemic and make public health orders \u2013 is likely to pass the upper house after a number of amendments were agreed.\nThe New South Wales premier, Dominic Perrottet, on Tuesday delayed debate until next year on extending his state\u2019s emergency pandemic powers.\nThe three key Victorian crossbench MPs \u2013 Samantha Ratnam of the Greens, Fiona Patten of the Reason party and Andy Meddick of the Animal Justice party \u2013 said the agreed amendments strengthened the bill with \u201cfurther transparency and accountability\u201d.\nThe MPs faced death threats and abuse in the lead-up to the debate over the controversial legislation.\nThe Victorian Labor MP Harriet Shing said protests against the bill had become \u201cpersonal\u201d and had caused parliamentarians and members of staff to \u201csecond guess their security\u201d.\n\u201cIt has caused people ... enormous alarm, not just for themselves, but for their families,\u201d she said. \u201cIt has to stop. It is a tiny, vocal, angry minority that diminishes the efforts of ... those who have contacted our offices to have a view on these matters.\u201d\nBut the Liberal MP Bernie Finn commended the protesters for \u201ctaking a stand for freedom\u201d. Finn attended one of the rallies at the weekend, where he said thousands of people were present.\n\u201cThose people in the streets aren\u2019t going to wear what this premier is trying to pull. You\u2019ve got people prepared to sleep on the streets of this parliament as a vigil, such is their commitment.\n\u201cThe people are marching in the street not because they\u2019re some kind of leftwing or rightwing neo-Nazi or white supremacist, they\u2019re people who have been ignored by Daniel Andrews for far too long ... they\u2019ve been pushed to breaking point.\u201d\nThe Liberal MP David Davis said the rushing through of the bill was a \u201cdirect repudiation\u201d of the bill of rights and the protections of MPs \u201cgoing about their work in a proper way\u201d.\nThe bill was pushed through the lower house in 36 hours last month.\n\u201cThey know they\u2019re trampling on human rights, they know what they\u2019re doing is simply reprehensible and it cannot stand justification in its current form in any way,\u201d Davis said.\nPatten said the pandemic legislation, if passed, would be reviewed within two years, and it was a \u201cdelicate balance\u201d protecting human rights and health.\nThe Liberal Democratic Party MP David Limbrick told the Legislative Council on Tuesday he would oppose the bill and warned if it did pass the protest movement would grow.\n\u201cDo we think that if this passes today, and the legislation is applied, that those 50,000 people or so who marched on Saturday will just shrug their shoulders and say, \u2018Oh, well, we tried\u2019? I doubt it. The giant has awoken.\u201d\nLimbrick said people would forget parts of the pandemic but they would not forget \u201cbeing bullied\u201d.\nThe shadow attorney general, Matt Bach, condemned some \u201cappalling incidents\u201d at the protests but said it was incorrect to claim that \u201conly crazies oppose this bill\u201d, pointing to comments from various legal organisations in the state raising concerns about it.\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nRatnam told parliament it was \u201ccompletely irresponsible\u201d for members of parliament to not condemn the protests where nooses and gallows were displayed. She said the campaign against the bill had \u201cdeliberately and maliciously\u201d taken advantage of people\u2019s genuine fears and anxieties during the pandemic and sought to whip them up to a \u201cgenuinely heightened state of terror, quite disconnected from the reality of what is actually happening in Victoria now\u201d.\n\u201cWhat I have also noticed is that almost every email or phone call or social media message [about the bill] has contained some form of misinformation [or] conspiracy theory, whether it is anti-vax conspiracy or something else, or some form of gross misrepresentation of the legislation we\u2019re debating,\u201d she said.\nThe Liberal MP Gordon Rich-Phillips tried to adjourn debate on the bill and refer the legislation to the scrutiny of acts and regulations committee to conduct a full inquiry with public hearings, reporting back at the end of November. But the motion failed 19 votes to 18.\nThe Law Institute of Victoria released a statement on Tuesday saying it was \u201cpleased\u201d to see the amendments but if its further key recommendations weren\u2019t secured, a sunset clause should be introduced so any new legislation would expire between 18 and 24 months after its commencement.\nThe Victorian Bar said the amendments didn\u2019t go far enough in protecting the rule of law. \u201cThe proposed amendments largely address low-priority issues and not the most fundamental problems with the bill,\u201d it said.\n\u201cThe major issues include the lack of effective parliamentary control over the minister\u2019s pandemic orders and the lack of provision for an independent review of authorised officers\u2019 exercise of power.\u201d\nThe Victorian Equal Opportunity and Human Rights Commission welcomed the amendments. The commissioner, Ro Allen, said the \u201cclarity announced today strengthens the bill and its human rights commitments\u201d.",

        "content": "Absence from shortlists amid the continuing show trial of Rassie Erasmus has left Springboks fans feeling disrespected\nIt was the last straw for many South Africans. So far this year they have battled their way past Covid-19 and the British & Irish Lions, beaten New Zealand on the Gold Coast and, more recently, overturned Wales and Scotland. And how many of their beloved Springboks have been shortlisted for a men\u2019s player or coaching World Rugby award? None, niemand or akukho nanye, depending on whether you prefer to receive your bad news in English, Afrikaans or Xhosa.\nOn its own this would have been a relatively minor issue. France\u2019s Antoine Dupont, England\u2019s Maro Itoje and the Wallabies\u2019 duo of Michael Hooper and Samu Kerevi are all fine players and no one has ever argued that award shortlists are a perfect science. But the context is all: plenty of people in South Africa are already outraged at what they regard as the continuing showtrial of Rassie Erasmus, the Springboks\u2019 director of rugby, in the wake of his infamous Lions tour video rant and detect a recurring theme.\nThere is obviously a danger here of putting two and two together and coming up with a number well in excess of four. The view from north of the equator can also be markedly different from how the world appears from down south, even if South African provincial sides now feature in the new United Rugby Championship. One thing, though, is very clear: many in South Africa feel disrespected, patronised and wronged and are increasingly making those views clear.\nWhich is why the omission of, among others, Siya Kolisi, Damian de Allende, Lukhanyo Am and Eben Etzebeth from the player shortlist prompted such an outcry on social media. The former Springbok captain John Smit was on the World Rugby panel but little good it did Kolisi or his teammates. Incidentally there were no All Blacks shortlisted, either, which really is a moment for the scrapbook.\nThere is certainly a strong argument that Kolisi and the consistently influential De Allende have been unlucky, with Erasmus\u2019s colleague Jacques Nienaber also a conspicuous absentee from the coaching list. Then again, after Saturday\u2019s result in Dublin, maybe Andy Farrell deserved greater recognition for helping to engineer Ireland\u2019s third win over the All Blacks in five meetings. Not that any of the above names would end up victorious: the brilliant Dupont is a shoo-in for player of the year and, if a rising results graph is the main criteria, the England women\u2019s head coach, Simon Middleton, would fully deserve an award for his coaching.\nBut this is meant to be a piece about contrasting perceptions and whether, specifically, South African rugby is getting the thin end of the wedge. There is even a precise date \u2013 15 November 2017 \u2013 when that jaundiced belief became properly entrenched.\nDespite South Africa\u2019s bid to stage the 2023 Rugby World Cup having been recommended as the preferred option, a controversial secret ballot instead ended up awarding the tournament to France, prompting SA Rugby\u2019s president, Mark Alexander, to issue an apology to South Africans for raising their hopes. It just happened to coincide with Erasmus\u2019s return from Munster to pick up the Springbok reins and we all know how that turned out.\nSouth Africa were deserved winners of the Webb Ellis Cup, their pack proving themselves first among equals and their muscular gameplan demolishing England in the 2019 final. Was there any hint of disrespect from the northern hemisphere as Kolisi hoisted the trophy aloft? Not remotely, but the arrival of Covid meant the Boks never had the collective chance to undertake the year-long global lap of honour their achievement clearly merited.\nMaybe that is why this summer\u2019s Lions tour had an increasingly sour edge to it: the more the visitors laid waste to below-strength provincial sides, the less it felt as if they were touring the strongest rugby nation on Earth. The economic and social hardships, the player drain to richer club leagues, the lack of crowds and face-to-face interaction to humanise the experience \u2026 if you are being generous you can begin to see why Erasmus started to act as if the whole rugby world was against him.\nMy personal sense is that he had also studied how New Zealand sought to get at Warren Gatland on the 2017 Lions tour and, once South Africa had gone 1-0 down in a tight Lions series, decided he had little to lose. Had he showcased more of the tight decisions that went against the Lions as well as those that went in South Africa\u2019s favour, his hour-long video might have had genuine validity. As it was, for anyone not wearing green and gold blinkers, the blatant attempt to influence the refereeing of the final two Tests \u2013 which duly worked a treat \u2013 clearly rode roughshod over any notion of protecting the sport\u2019s integrity or respecting the officials.\nThe verdict of the independent panel is due to be made public in the coming days and will inevitably generate further howls of protest regardless of the outcome. If it is legitimate to ask why it has taken four months to reach this point, part of the answer lies in the behind-the-scenes legal wrangling on the South African side. In Johannesburg and Bloemfontein it has long since become less about a video and more about the alleged desire of certain others to diminish Erasmus and tarnish the legacy of their World Cup-winning national hero.\nSo watch this space for the dramatic final reel. Will Erasmus simply receive a fine and a slap on his laptop wrist or something more draconian? Will the Springboks have the last laugh out on the pitch and add England to their pile of scalps? And while we are at it \u2013 shortlists aside \u2013 let us all pray for one more thing: a transparently level playing field and less angry finger-pointing across rugby\u2019s supposed north-south divide.\n This is an extract from our rugby union email, the Breakdown.

        "content": "Avila\u2019s work, illegal in every US state except California, helps her clients \u2018experience genuine arousal, desire and pleasure\u2019\nSomewhere in southern California, Shandra Barrera and Camille Slusher sit with mirrors between their legs, staring at their yonis.\nThey are participants on Sex, Love & Goop, the Gwyneth Paltrow-fronted Netflix series, which aims to help couples \u201cexperience genuine arousal, desire and pleasure\u201d.\nThe mirrors are a tool used by Darshana Avila, one of the show\u2019s sex and intimacy coaches who, in this episode, is helping Barrera with the pain she experiences when she receives penetrative touch.\n\u201cWhat does she need to hear?\u201d Avila asks Barrera about her vagina. \u201cRelax!\u201d Barrera responds, shouting at the mirror in between her legs. Avila suggests chiding herself might not be helping. This is all part of the buildup to the main event, when Avila will penetrate Barrera on screen with her hand, hopefully without causing her pain.\nThat Avila\u2019s job can involve touching clients\u2019 genitals, makes her practice illegal in every US state apart from California. It\u2019s not a service that all of her clients need, but when they do, she works with them to build a healthy relationship based on communication, consent and trust.\n\u201cWe first are laying down a foundation that helps them learn about tracking themselves, because if you don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening in your body or where your boundaries lie, it\u2019s almost impossible to be in a fully consensual exchange,\u201d Avila explains.\nIf those conversations go well, they may lead to a session where Avila helps her clients discover pleasure in its many forms. \u201cSure, it could be ecstatic orgasmic pleasure. But as we saw on the show, it can be the pleasure of Shandra, for instance, receiving penetrative touch without pain.\nSo why is this service not on offer everywhere?\n\u201cIf you look at this very simplistically, we have a legal and cultural bias that says, if you are not a medical practitioner, any context in which you were touching somebody\u2019s genitals is wrong, bad and subject to legal action,\u201d she says, pointing out fears of abuse or non-consensual touch. But in the case of sexological bodywork, she explains: \u201cIt\u2019s assuming that there is an exchange that isn\u2019t actually happening. [My job] is one directional. I am not receiving touch, I have clothing on. I have gloves on my hands,\u201d she says.\nAvila sees a host of clients who come to her for issues ranging from the concise (I can\u2019t orgasm; I have an injury after birth that\u2019s still bothering me) to the ineffable (I don\u2019t feel at home in my body; I love my partner but we don\u2019t bond sexually). \u201cWe start creating this journey together, where I get a sense of where the missing puzzle pieces are and we go about filling them in and connecting them up,\u201d Avila explains over the phone.\n\u201cI\u2019ve learned that we have a major cultural bias against pleasure,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have this really narrow definition, that is: pleasure equals orgasm. But your eroticism isn\u2019t necessarily focused on your genitals,\u201d she says.\nFor Barrera and Slusher \u2013 the ones staring into their vaginas through a mirror \u2013 their discomfort with their pleasure is clearly laid out on the show. Barrera\u2019s comes from her strict religious upbringing in a home where sex wasn\u2019t spoken about and lesbianism wasn\u2019t condoned. Now, pleasure makes her feel shame \u2013 so much so that her body tenses up when she is about to be touched. For Slusher, her own anxieties about her body prevent her from being able to get out of her head and enjoy sex.\nA common misconception that people have about sex, Avila tells me, is that our partners don\u2019t want to hear us say what feels good or bad sexually. We assume it will make them feel inadequate or that it is selfish. In fact, we tend to assume that sex is better when not spoken about very much at all.\n\u201cI give people worksheets, that have lists of words about sensations and emotions, and ideas for ways you can touch. People get afraid they\u2019re going to offend somebody. And they haven\u2019t gotten to practice those skills. But they\u2019re very learnable \u2013 it\u2019s not rocket science,\u201d she reassures.\nThe worksheets include knowing exactly what types of touch are available to you \u2013 from stillness, compression and squeezing to stroking or tickling. It also includes being able to talk about where you like to experience these sensations and how they make your body feel.\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying you\u2019re going to learn everything from a textbook. But there are fundamental things \u2026 that will make a difference,\u201d she says.\nAvila believes that people talking to one another regularly, concisely and openly deepens intimacy, although she understands why people fear it will destroy it. Telling your partner things aren\u2019t working for you is vulnerable, revealing. We struggle to advocate for ourselves even at the best of times \u2013 let alone when we\u2019re naked. So requests need to be made in a way that invites intimacy, instead of taking it off the table.\nMuch of this is intuitive: don\u2019t start the conversation in the middle of sex, make sure it comes at a time when both partners are ready to receive it (so, not when you\u2019re hungry or in the middle of an argument or tired or drunk); use ample praise\u2013 couch requests within the frame of what is going well.\nIf the sex is really bad \u2013 and there are no good things for the requests to be couched in \u2013 Avila suggests focusing on the relationship. \u201cPlace an emphasis on: \u2018I want to be in conversation with you,\u2019\u201d she says, \u201creally emphasize the mutuality of that, even if you\u2019re coming to say something like, \u2018You have never touched me in a way that feels good\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019ve been faking my orgasms for five years.\u2019\u201d\nBeing in the presence of a licensed third party, if that\u2019s available to you, can help.\n\u201cOften when I\u2019m working with couples, I feel like one of the hats I wear is translator and interpreter. Because I can hear what comes out of one person\u2019s mouth, I can hear how it lands with the other person,\u201d she says.\nAre there any questions that come up time and time again?\n\u201c\u2018Am I normal?\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cPeople want to know, desperately, that they are not the only ones. And the answer is, you are totally normal. You are not the only one and you\u2019re also not broken,\u201d she says.\nAvila believes this is the product of the unhealthy culture we live in, one that is dysfunctional, toxic, misogynistic. And that extends to the work that she\u2019s doing not being available everywhere in the US.\nIn another scene from Sex, Love & Goop, Barrera is laying down, covered by a blanket and her partner, Slusher, is watching. \u201cI\u2019m going to stroke your labia,\u201d says Avila. Then, she places her finger at the entrance of Barrera\u2019s vagina, narrating her movements as she goes. She hears Barrera tense. \u201cI\u2019m starting to feel a little bit of pain,\u201d Barrera says. Avila lightens her touch, and tells Barrera to breathe. \u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d she asks. Soon there is relief, as Barrera realizes she is receiving penetrative touch. \u201cI don\u2019t feel any pain, which is crazy,\u201d she says.\n\u201cThere is your love,\u201d says Avila. \u201cAnd here is your body feeling safe enough to receive.\u201d\nI ask Avila how it makes her feel, to know that people like Barrera can\u2019t receive this same sort of service openly in so many US states. \u201cHonestly, it breaks my heart,\u201d she says. \u201cIt makes me deeply sad on a certain level and angry on another that more people are not being given ready access to the qualities of care and support that really nurture them into their wholeness,\u201d she says.\nBut she\u2019s also happy that this work has been spotlighted on a show on Netflix.\n\u201cNow it is seen in a mainstream context,\u201d she says. \u201cI think all of us need therapy to work through what\u2019s happening in our hearts, in our psyches and our mind. Why would we not want that for our bodies and for our sexuality and intimacy, which are such integral parts of what it is to be alive?\u201d",

        "content": "Unemployment rate drops to 4.3% as businesses recruit after removal of Covid restrictions\nThe number of workers on UK company payrolls rose sharply last month despite the end of the government\u2019s furlough scheme, after a record increase in people moving from unemployment into work ahead of its closure.\nThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) said Britain\u2019s employers added 160,000 more workers to their payrolls in October, taking the total to 29.3million in the first month after the removal of the multibillion-pound wage subsidy scheme.\nThe headline unemployment rate fell by more than expected, dropping to 4.3% in the three months to the end of September, from 4.5% in August. However, it still remains above the pre-pandemic level of 4%.\nIt comes after the Bank of England held back from raising interest rates earlier this month while waiting to see what happened in the jobs market after the removal of furlough, confounding financial market expectations for the first rise in borrowing costs since the pandemic began.\nSome analysts said the jobs figures could provide Threadneedle Street with a green light for raising interest rates before Christmas \u2013 if a similar picture is maintained in the next set of official labour market figures on 14 December.\nAndrew Bailey, the Bank\u2019s governor, said on Monday he was \u201cvery uneasy\u201d about rising inflation across the British economy, and came \u201cvery close\u201d to raising rates earlier this month. The Bank will next make a decision on interest rates on 16 December.\n\u201cToday\u2019s release has given the Bank an amber light and the next labour market release will probably give it the green light to raise interest rates from 0.1% to 0.25%,\u201d said Paul Dales, the chief UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics.\nAccording to the latest snapshot, a net increase of 304,000 people moved from unemployment into work in the three months to the end of September, the biggest jump on modern records dating back to 2001.\nTotal job-to-job moves also rose to a record high, largely driven by people quitting their old jobs rather than dismissals; a development branded by some commentators as the \u201cgreat resignation\u201d, as people reassessed their priorities after lockdown and took advantage of the support furlough offered for job switching.\n\u201cIt\u2019s fortunate that the furlough scheme ended at a very strong period of labour demand,\u201d said Grant Fitzner, the chief economist at the ONS. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing unprecedented levels of job switching at the moment.\u201d\nIt comes as employers across the country struggle with chronic staff shortages after the easing of pandemic restrictions, especially in care, warehousing and logistics, with job vacancies across the economy reaching a record high of almost 1.2m. The ONS said it was possible that those made redundant at the end of furlough would not yet be included in the data as they worked out their notice period. However, surveys of employers suggested the numbers made redundant was likely to be small.\nMore than 1m jobs were still furloughed in the final weeks of the scheme, although about half of workers had returned to their jobs on a part-time basis while still receiving wage support from the state.\nSome employment experts warned the rise in employment was driven by part-time jobs and young people taking on zero-hours contracts, while many furloughed staff will have returned to their jobs on fewer hours.\nIn a sign of continuing pressure after the end of furlough, more than 2 million people were claiming unemployment-related benefits in October. Although down from a peak of almost 2.7 million at the height of the pandemic in 2020, it remains significantly higher than the 1.2 million claiming benefits before the pandemic struck.\nIt comes after the government removed a \u00a320 uplift in universal credit from early October in the biggest overnight cut to benefits on record.\nThe chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said the latest figures showed the \u201cextraordinary success of the furlough scheme\u201d and were evidence of the government\u2019s plan for jobs working.\n\u201cWe know how vital keeping people in good jobs is, both for them and for our economy \u2013 which is why it\u2019s fantastic to see the unemployment rate falling for nine months in a row and record numbers of people moving into employment,\u201d he said.\nHowever, experts said average wage growth appears to have lost momentum. Official figures showed average annual growth in total pay packets, including bonuses, fell to 5.8% in September from 7.2% a month earlier.\nAlthough the drop reflected distortions caused by the pandemic gradually dropping out of the official figures, analysts said wage rises would fail to keep pace with higher levels of inflation.\nNye Cominetti, the senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: \u201cWhile unemployment is unlikely to be a problem this winter, pay may well be. The economy needs \u2018goldilocks\u2019 pay growth \u2013 fast enough to protect living standards, but not so fast as to generate excessive inflation.\u201d",

        "content": "Sykes says being diagnosed as autistic at 51 has helped explain struggles during broadcasting career\nThe TV presenter Melanie Sykes has announced she has been diagnosed as autistic at the age of 51.\nIn an email to readers of her magazine the Frank, Sykes opened up about the \u201clife-changing\u201d diagnosis and her relief that things in her life had finally started to \u201cmake sense\u201d.\n\u201cThis week has been truly life-changing, or rather, life-affirming,\u201d she wrote in the email, originally obtained by the Sun. \u201cAs many of you may or may not know, I was diagnosed with autism late Thursday afternoon. And then, finally, so many things made sense.\u201d\nShe said her diagnosis had come as a huge relief and was one she would be celebrating. \u201cI now have a deeper understanding of myself, my life, and the things I have endured.\u201d\nShe described the previously unexplainable struggles she had faced throughout her career, including while working on live TV. \u201cThe sensitivities around working in television have come up,\u201d she said. \u201cI have always struggled with earpieces, what they call talkback, where you hear what the director says. I have often accidentally responded to the director in my ear, live on air, as I cannot juggle the person I am interviewing and the person in my ear at the same time.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cMy memory has always been problematic, and remembering pieces to camera could spin me out, resulting in sleepless nights beforehand. There have been many tears of fear and frustration.\u201d\nIn a video on Instagram, Sykes further explained how the conversation came up when she was making a documentary about the failures of the education system, especially for children who are autistic, so she decided to do the assessments.\n\nAutism is a spectrum disorder, which is defined by having difficulties with social communication and restricted or repetitive behaviours, activities or interests. It is a neurodevelopmental disorder, meaning that these difficulties would have existed since childhood even if someone is diagnosed as an adult.\nAutistic traits appear on a spectrum, meaning that people are affected in different ways and to different degrees. For instance, some autistic people are unable to speak or have very limited verbal communication, while others have sophisticated language skills, but may struggle with taking things literally or find abstract concepts harder to follow.\nAutistic people may have difficulty reading other people\u2019s emotions or intentions, which can make socialising difficult to navigate. They may struggle to make friends or sustain friendships. That doesn\u2019t mean that autistic people lack emotion or do not desire friendships and social acceptance, however.\nChange to routines or unexpected events can be stressful. Autistic people may prefer to stick closely to a known pattern of behaviour, such as eating the same meal each morning, wearing the same clothes. Some autistic people repeat movements such as flapping their hands, rocking or twirling around and find that these behaviours help calm them down when they are feeling anxious.\nAutism is linked to highly focused interests or hobbies. The topic could be something niche like stamp collecting or electricity pylons, or something more mainstream such as environmental activism or fashion. It\u2019s the nature and intensity of the interest that is unusual, not necessarily the topic.\nAutistic people may also have sensory sensitivities, such as finding loud noises overwhelming, finding scratchy materials particularly uncomfortable or having an aversion to certain food textures.\nAn autism diagnosis is made on behavioural criteria and this criteria has broadened over time. This means that autism spectrum disorder is a very diverse group with some needing full-time support and others having specific challenges in certain areas of their lives.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a sense of relief about it and a sense of mourning. Not because I don\u2019t want to be who I am, it\u2019s that I wish I\u2019d known sooner so I could have understood exactly why things were rolling the way they were rolling.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been vulnerable to abusive people, I\u2019ve been vulnerable to people that lie because I only see and take on board what people tell me. I\u2019ve always been a bit funny with jokes, if somebody tells me something with a deadpan delivery I believe them.\u201d\nThis article includes content provided by Instagram.

Appearing on ITV\u2019s Loose Women on Monday, McGuinness discussed how autism had affected her life and relationships, including having to \u201clearn how to behave\u201d.\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been afraid to say it out loud because I know it seems odd and it seems different,\u201d said McGuinness, who is married to the TV presenter Paddy McGuinness. \u201cIf I go to a hotel room I will rearrange the furniture, I\u2019ll take the pictures of the wall.\u201d",

The judge said that although the defendant was in police custody at the time of the actual shooting on 17 April 1984, having being arrested earlier that day, he had allowed the shooter(s) into the building to position themselves to fire their guns, knowing they would do so.\nHe also recruited volunteers to \u201cdeal with\u201d the anti-Gaddafi protesters, directed counter-protesters to stand away from the line of fire and attempted to bring a solider into the embassy that day to instruct people in the firing and dismantling of weapons.\nThe judgment is unlikely to result in any criminal action against Mabrouk, who is in Libya.\nSpencer said Mabrouk\u2019s comment to a police officer putting out barriers before the protest was of \u201ccritical importance\u201d in the case. The defendant had said: \u201cWe have guns here today, there is going to be fighting. We aren\u2019t going to have responsibility for you or the barriers.\u201d\nDuring his judgment, Spencer appeared to be overcome by emotion as he told Murray, who has spoken of his guilt that he could not save Fletcher, that he should feel proud of his conduct on the day of the shooting, including rushing to his friend\u2019s assistance despite danger to himself.\nAfter the judgment, Murray, who was awarded the \u00a31 in nominal damages he had sought, said: \u201cThis has been a battle lasting 37 years. It is a huge weight off my shoulders. My promise to Yvonne Fletcher to find those responsible for the shooting and to get justice has taken a huge step forward after all these years.\u201d\nMabrouk insisted in a letter to the court that he was innocent of any involvement, but did not participate in the proceedings. He was arrested over Fletcher\u2019s murder in 2015, but in 2017, Scotland Yard detectives dropped the investigation, saying key evidence could not be used in court for reasons of national security.",

        "content": "PC, PlayStation 4/5, Xbox One/Series X/S; Frontier DevelopmentsThough there are moments of bloody mayhem, the focus in this beautiful game is on wondrous natural history\nLike its hulking, tourist-gulping attractions, Jurassic World Evolution 2 has both a silly name and DNA that has been stitched together from several different animals to create something improbably beautiful. A bridge between the spiritually bereft Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom and the forthcoming Jurassic World: Dominion, this could so easily have been another cash-grab movie tie-in. Instead it\u2019s a beautiful game predominantly about finding the wonder in the creatures you\u2019re looking after (or chasing around in Jeeps). And where John Hammond failed, this is a park experience I can thoroughly endorse, even if people do get eaten with distressing regularity.\nThanks to the events of the most recent film, in which a plot device dressed as an eight-year-old girl causes dinosaurs to be released into the wild, there has never been a better time to open one\u2019s own Jurassic Park. All of the busy work from the first film (finding a mosquito trapped in amber, sucking out its prehistoric meal of dino blood, and hoping like a kid with a new pack of trading cards that it\u2019s not one you\u2019ve already got) can be dispensed with. Instead we have the faintly Metal Gear Solid V experience of sneaking up on confused dinosaurs, hitting them with a tranquilliser dart and then watching a cargo chopper swoop down and snatch them up and away to begin a happier life in the paddock you\u2019ve just built for them. Later you\u2019ll recruit scientists, who can be sent on longer-range kidnappings to return rarer species.\nWith the help of series heroes Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard), Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) and Owen Grady (someone who certainly knows who Chris Pratt is), you must make sure the dinosaurs are happy, which you do by covering their paddocks in the right kind of shrubs, keeping their doctor\u2019s appointments regular and not accidentally airdropping them into pens with things that want to eat them. The more (and more exotic) dinosaurs you collect, the more visitors will be drawn to marvel at the park\u2019s exhibits, eat in the park\u2019s restaurants, and then be eaten by the park\u2019s exhibits.\nHonestly, though, zooming in on the odd moment of violence and chaos misses the point of JWE2. If this game were a scene from the films, it would not be the soldiers getting picked off and torn apart by raptors in the long grass, nor the final battle with the Indominus Rex from Jurassic World. Rather, it would be Sam Neill\u2019s Dr Alan Grant leaning his whole body against the heaving side of the sickly triceratops, while Laura Dern\u2019s Dr Ellie Sattler examines its tongue and talks to a park ranger about its diet of potentially poisonous herbs. Dr Grant grins like a child, pressed up so close against such a wondrously recreated creature. That\u2019s the feeling you get playing JWE2.\nSelecting a dinosaur zooms the camera in from the top-down, god\u2019s-eye-view to track it as it plods around its enclosure, grazing, drinking from a watering hole or occasionally battling a member of the pack for dominance. Each dinosaur comes with a multimillion year history including detailed accounts of what it ate and where it lived. Even though you\u2019re sat in your living room, Frontier Developments\u2019 magic is in transporting us \u2013 through lifelike animations, through snuffling grunts, through the soppy look in a stegosaurus\u2019s eyes \u2013 to where we all wanted to be in 1993: standing in a real Jurassic Park, watching these impossibly majestic creatures.\nJurassic World Evolution 2 is out now (9 November); \u00a349.99",

Roger spent more than a year in the hospital before he was transferred to a care home.\n\u201cWe just unfortunately accepted the fact that we weren\u2019t going to know what he had until he died,\u201d said Ellis.\nRoger remains in the care home, and his family now believes he is part of a cluster of people suffering from a mysterious progressive neurological illness.\nThe cases, largely concentrated in a sparsely populated area of New Brunswick, have stumped experts. And the mystery has prompted a fierce row between officials who suggest the cases are unrelated, and scientists who have argued that they may all have been triggered by environmental factors or contaminants.\nVictims experience unexplained pains, spasms and behavioural changes, said Dr Alier Marrero, the neurologist who first identified the cluster. Many then showed signs of cognitive decline, muscle wasting, drooling and teeth chattering and frightening hallucinations.\nSo far, 48 cases have been publicly acknowledged, but officials familiar with research into the cluster have told the Guardian that the number of affected people now exceeds 100.\nPublic health officials have been tracking the cases for nearly a year and given little indication they were close to a solution.\nBut in a surprise turn of events, New Brunswick\u2019s health minister, Dorothy Shephard, announced in late October that an epidemiological report had found no significant evidence that any known food, behaviour or environmental exposure could be responsible.\nThe press conference followed a controversial paper presented to the Canadian Association of Neuropathologists that claimed eight deaths attributed to the cluster were \u201cmisdiagnoses\u201d of known diseases, such as Alzheimer\u2019s and cancer.\nNew Brunswick officials started to float the idea that the cluster itself might be a conflation of unrelated cases. But the sudden shift has prompted concern among victims\u2019 families that the province is rushing to declare the case closed.\n\u201cIt was just a display of how incompetent and disorganized the province has been,\u201d said Ellis, who says other families he has spoken with are \u201cdevastated\u201d by the province\u2019s response. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame that my father and so many others have to be involved in this mess.\u201d\nThe episode has also exposed the fractured relationship between the province and federal health authorities, who were asked not to assist in the investigation \u2013 and say they were prevented from testing tissue samples of deceased patients.\nStaff at Canada\u2019s public health agency said they were blindsided by the press conference and the controversial paper \u2013 and cast doubt on the province\u2019s suggestion that there was no link between the cases.\n\u201cIt was unbelievable,\u201d one scientist told the Guardian. \u201cEven a layperson understands that you\u2019re never going to find anything by just looking at the phenomenon itself. You need to have a control group \u2026 It was just rookie epidemiology.\u201d\nResidents first learned of the mysterious cluster nearly a year ago, when a leaked memo from the province\u2019s public health agency asked physicians to be on the lookout for symptoms similar to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) \u2013 a rare, fatal brain disease caused by misformed proteins known as prions.\nBut in late October, a paper presented by Dr Gerard Jansen the Canadian Association of Neuropathologists shocked families by suggesting that eight of the victims had died from unrelated brain diseases.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve asked unequivocally for that study to be pulled and for an apology to be issued,\u201d said Kat Lanteigne, head of the non-profit advocacy group BloodWatch. \u201cEvery single scientist that our organization has ever worked with or reached out to is absolutely mortified.\u201d\nJansen\u2019s paper was also condemned by Canada\u2019s public health agency, which accused him of improperly using private data.\nJansen did not respond to a request for comment, but previously told CBC News that the federal agency doesn\u2019t own the data. He also said that after presenting his findings, colleagues \u201cunanimously concurred with my findings in all eight autopsies and my conclusions [regarding] this cluster\u201d.\nThe Public Health Agency of Canada said that it \u201creserves the right to take corrective action, to ensure that this kind of situation does not recur and, if necessary, to remedy any resulting misinterpretation of facts in the public health context.\u201d\nAnd other scientists have also cast doubt on Jansen\u2019s findings.\n\u201c[Jansen] has deeply, deeply misinterpreted the significance of his findings,\u201d said one federal scientist, who argued that even if the victims suffered known brain diseases, , that would not rule out the impact of environmental factors.\nIncreasingly, experts believe \u03b2-Methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA) \u2013 a neurotoxin found in blue-green algae blooms across the province \u2013 could help explain the varied symptoms.In one study, high concentrations of BMAA were found in lobster. Harvesting lobster is one of New Brunswick\u2019s biggest economic drivers \u2013 promoting speculation that the efforts to rule out the existence of a cluster could be motivated by political decision making.\nFederal scientists would like to test brain tissue from eight people within the cluster who have died for potential environmental toxins. But the province has refused permission for such studies.\nFamilies and scientists have also grown troubled by the New Brunswick government\u2019s apparent efforts to distance itself from Marrero, the neurologist who identified the cluster.\nNew Brunswick\u2019s health minister, Dorothy Shephard, recently told reporters there had been \u201cissues\u201d in the reporting process that allowed the situation to escalate \u201coften without oversight\u201d and omitted that Marrero had worked with federal scientists, as well as neurologists in other provinces, when first identifying the cluster.\nThe provincial health ministry did not respond to a request for comment from the Guardian.\nBut for experts in brain disease, the age range of patients in the cluster, the volume of cases and the geographic location of those suffering suggests more thorough investigation is needed.\n\u201cThese kinds of things just don\u2019t lend themselves easily to explanation that it\u2019s just a random collection of sporadically occurring cases that have been artificially lumped together by an over-enthusiastic neurologist,\u201d said the scientist. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t wash.\u201d\nA second investigation, led by a committee of neurologists from across the province \u2013 but probably not including Marrero \u2013 is expected to release a second report early next year after reviewing the 48 patients, nearly all of whom were treated by Marrero.\n\u201cThey really seem to be discrediting him without using his name,\u201d said Ellis. \u201cThis is unacceptable. Of all people, he has been the one that has been the most communicative during these last few months. His work ethic and his professionalism and empathy are just top notch.\u201d\nEllis says that if it weren\u2019t for the leak of the CJD memo last year, the public would still be in the dark.\n\u201cIt makes me sick to think that they\u2019re trying to set this up to be nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you know what? At the end of the day, if it is nothing, then we still have to figure out how to help people. Because they\u2019re still suffering.\u201d",

        "content": "A few old flaws remain, but Southgate is edging towards a better set-up, even if it means keeping back some flair options\nWithin nine months of his first match as England manager in 1963, Alf Ramsey had seen his side put eight past both Switzerland and Northern Ireland (Bobby Charlton scored three in the first of those games, Jimmy Greaves four in the second, if anyone is minded to complain about Harry Kane and stat-padding). Amid general excitement, Ramsey was unmoved: the capacity to hammer minnows (as Switzerland and Northern Ireland then were), he cautioned, had very little to do with the business of winning tournaments.\nFor a country such as England, qualifying is a curious business. Get through easily and it is treated with a weary sigh, as though getting to the finals was always assured and the draw was kind. Struggle and the sense is, understandably, that if you can\u2019t beat that lot, what hope do you have against the big sides? England made this group look straightforward, and the experience of Portugal and Italy suggests that achievement should not be underestimated. Poland, Hungary and an improving Albania were all potentially awkward opponents.\nThe way the fixtures fell, there were three games in which there could have been pressure: at home to Poland, away to Hungary and at home to Albania. England won all three, the last two of those by an aggregate 9-0. Previous England sides have often struggled to dispatch lesser sides who sit deep against them; under Southgate they have revelled in that \u2013 which is another reason Kane\u2019s remarkable goals return shouldn\u2019t be dismissed.\nWhile the 1-1 draw at home to Hungary was frustrating, the two matches that raise greater concerns were those against Poland. England controlled the early part of the meeting at Wembley, went ahead and then fell back, leading to a Poland equaliser. England did burgle a late winner, although Southgate had not made any substitutions before it arrived and the shape of the game had barely changed. Then, in Poland, England again sat off having taken the lead and on that occasion ended up conceding in injury-time to drop two points.\nOn the one hand, taking four points from the second team in the group is a useful return (and an important one: had those results been reversed, Poland would have been in a position to finish above England with a draw against Hungary on Monday), but on the other, both did highlight the one repeated failing of the Southgate reign, the tendency to drop too deep having taken the lead against decent opposition. It happened against Colombia and Croatia at the 2018 World Cup and it happened against Italy in the Euro 2020 final. The issue feels as much psychological as tactical and long predates Southgate but it is something that has to be resolved if England are ever to win anything.\nThat\u2019s not to say England should be gung-ho, or that there is anything wrong about the basic balance of the side. Southgate has been admirably strong in resisting the temptation to try to shoehorn in more of England\u2019s vast array of attacking talent. More than the 39 goals scored, the most impressive statistic from qualifying is perhaps that they let in only three. As at the Euros, there are sure to be pleas before the World Cup for him to let the players off the leash, to give them their head, but the truth is that no side has won a major tournament playing a columnist\u2019s romantic ideal of football since probably France in 1984.\nIt\u2019s the nature of international football that far too much is read into individual games, and no experiment should be entirely written off on the basis of one match, but it did feel significant that England\u2019s worst performance in qualifying was against Hungary, when Southgate fielded both Phil Foden and Mason Mount in midfield with Jack Grealish and Raheem Sterling on the flanks. The idea that good players will work it out \u2013 which surely was disproved by the Gerrard-Lampard conundrum that blighted a generation \u2013 neglects the fact that England have four very good central midfielders anyway, in Jude Bellingham, Jordan Henderson, Kalvin Phillips and Declan Rice.\nThe most encouraging aspect of the past two international windows for England has been the form of Foden, who felt peripheral at the Euros \u2013 even if there was a sense he was missed in the later stages against Italy. But if Foden plays, that probably means only one of Sterling and Mount, both of whom have been regulars when fit, can be accommodated if the shape is to be the 3-4-3 Southgate used against Albania and San Marino, as well as against Germany and Italy in the summer.\nThat also means no starting berth for Grealish, Jadon Sancho, Emile Smith Rowe or Bukayo Saka (unless he plays at wing-back). But, as Argentina have found over the past decade and a half, having a fleet of gifted forwards is an advantage only if properly deployed; an international side must be thought of like a normal team, with its own dynamic, not as a reward for good domestic performances.\nThe quest for structure and balance may mean that, at times, England struggle to break down opponents who sit deep \u2013 as Hungary did at Wembley. But so long as England get through the group, that doesn\u2019t really matter. As Ramsey understood, tournaments are won not by thrashing lesser sides, but by beating good ones. England are contenders in Qatar and that means the next year has to be spent preparing for games against the elite. That may not be exciting, but it is necessary.",

Moscow denies this.\n\u201cWhen we say that we support the sovereignty and integrity of Ukraine, that is not because we want to be adversarial to Russia, or that we want in some way strategically to encircle or undermine that great country,\u201d Johnson said in a speech to City of London dignitaries at Mansion House on Monday.\nThe US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, warned earlier this year that Nord Stream 2 represented \u201ca Russian geopolitical project intended to divide Europe and weaken European energy security\u201d.\nEurope faces a looming winter gas crisis, which has fuelled fears of a widespread industrial slowdown due to factory shutdowns and potential power outages. It is also expected to drive a cost of living crisis for homes and small businesses.\nGas prices have reached record highs in recent months, ignited by a global surge in demand after the Covid-19 economic slowdown last year, and fuelled by Russia\u2019s reluctance to export extra supplies to Europe to help meet demand despite rocketing market prices.\nSome countries have accused Russia, which is Europe\u2019s largest gas supplier, of withholding extra gas supplies to Europe in order to pressure Germany to approve the gas project. The Kremlin has denied this.\nThe boss of commodities trading giant Trafigura, Jeremy Weir, warned that Europe could face \u201crolling blackouts\u201d this winter due to tight gas supplies and low gas storage levels.\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t got enough gas at the moment quite frankly; we\u2019re not storing for the winter period. So hence there\u2019s a real concern that there\u2019s a potential if we have a cold winter that we could have rolling blackouts in Europe,\u201d Weir told an industry conference.\nWeir warned that there was \u201can issue looming on oil prices on a long-term basis\u201d because of a slowdown in new oil production, and that it was \u201cvery possible\u201d that global oil prices, which have climbed by 60% since the start of the year to more than $80 a barrel, could reach $100 a barrel for the first time since 2014.",

Video showed stun grenades detonating near migrants on the Belarusian side of the border. Poland has claimed the stun grenades were provided by Belarus.\nPoland\u2019s defence ministry said on Tuesday it had \u201crepelled an attack\u201d at the border. \u201cAttack by migrants at the border crossing in Ku\u017anica,\u201d the defence ministry wrote. \u201cThe migrants are very aggressive, they throw stones at Polish officers and soldiers.\u201d\nPoland and Lithuania have declared states of emergency that give police sweeping new powers to summarily expel migrants and ignore requests for asylum. NGOs have complained that Polish authorities have refused to allow aid for migrants into the border area and journalists have been prevented from reporting close to the border.\nBy contrast, Tuesday\u2019s clashes at the border were covered live by state television in Belarus, where Lukashenko has sought to put blame for the border crisis on European governments. Belarusian troops have been accused of cutting through border fencing and pushing migrants into making dangerous attempts to cross the border.\nOn Monday, the local Muslim community of Bohoniki, a village in north-east Poland, held a funeral for Ahmad al-Hasan, 19, from Syria, who was found dead in the Bug river in eastern Poland on 19 October. According to witnesses, Ahmad, who could not swim, was pushed by a Belarusian soldier to enter the water. The funeral was streamed via Skype to the family of the young man.\nAnna Alboth of Grupa Granica, a network of Polish NGOs monitoring the situation on the border, said: \u201cIt was important for all of us to remember him and underline that this was the umpteenth, unnecessary death and if the Polish government had taken a different approach to solving this crisis, Ahmad would still be with us.\u201d\nAt least 12 migrants have died during the crisis, most due to exposure, Grupa Granica said. Doctors say they are receiving more requests from migrants in the Polish \u201csecure zone\u201d to treat dehydration, hypothermia and trauma from armed attacks. NGOs have described racing to reach migrants before the police, as Polish authorities can expel people regardless of their medical condition.\nNGOs have called for a humanitarian corridor into Poland. \u2018\u2019We believe that this is the only way of de-escalating the ensured violence,\u201d wrote Grupa Granica.\n\u201cWe have been receiving more and more disturbing information stating of attempts at forcing migrants to take part in Belarusian provocation and to use violence against the Polish officers \u2026 Considering their current situation and status as hostages of the regime, we can expect that a certain point they may be forced to do so.\u201d\nOn Monday, the Council of Europe\u2019s commissioner for human rights, Dunja Mijatovic, arrived in Poland on a four-day visit.\nOn Tuesday,Piotr Muller, a Polish government spokesman, said: \u201cWe are preparing for a pessimistic outcome \u2013 that this conflict could stretch out for months.\u201d The Polish government was considering launching formal consultations with Nato on how to solve the crisis, he said.\nHundreds of people, mainly from Iraq and Syria, had moved from an improvised campsite in the woods to the Ku\u017anica border crossing on Monday accompanied by Belarusian border guards.\nThey were allowed through Belarusian border checkpoints but were denied entry into Poland. There are many children among the asylum-seekers, who largely come from Iraq and Syria. Reuters reported that one nine-year-old Kurdish boy, a double-amputee hoping to reach Germany for medical treatment, had been trapped in freezing conditions outdoors for eight days.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very cold here ... We came here from Iraq for my son Taman. I want to take my family to a country where our rights will be protected,\u201d the boy\u2019s father told Reuters.\n\u201cAs a family we are in a very difficult position ... We are calling on everybody who can help us ... I want my son Taman to live in a beautiful place.\u201d\nVideo footage on Monday evening had showed Polish and Belarusian soldiers in a tense standoff after an attempted breach of the border fencing. One woman who appeared to have become trapped in razor wire screamed as a voice off-camera warned her not to move or she may injure herself further.\nThe German chancellor, Angela Merkel, spoke to Lukashenko by telephone on Monday evening about \u201cthe need for humanitarian aid for refugees and migrants\u201d. Russia has sought to establish direct contacts between Lukashenko and European governments, many of which have condemned him for his brutal crackdown on opposition.\nOn Tuesday, Germany announced it had temporarily suspended the certification process for the new Russian Nordstream 2 pipeline. While the process was officially suspended over a technical issue, it comes as tensions between Russia and the west have skyrocketed over the migrant crisis and a Russian troop buildup near the Ukraine border.",

These Titanic survivors arrived in the US looking to work as labourers, and under the provisions of the Chinese Exclusion Act they were shipped to other countries immediately after the sinking. Some disappeared without a trace. The only survivor whom the researchers were able to build a coherent narrative around was Fang Lang, who founded a business in the US by changing his name and working as a merchant, shielding himself from the Exclusion Act, which targeted manual labourers.\nWhile this documentary takes a pretty conventional approach, the emotional impact of the exhaustive research is gripping. At one point, a list of Fang Lang\u2019s personal items on the Titanic is uncovered, which includes dozens of neck ties: he was due to attend the wedding of his friend, who perished on this fateful trip. Above all, this film is a window into the open racism against immigrants, the ramifications of which are still deeply felt today.\n The Six is released on 16 November in cinemas.",

According to figures from Our World in Data, some African countries have even lower levels \u2013 in Nigeria the figure is only 2.8%.\nSpeaking at a meeting of the all-party parliamentary group on coronavirus (APPG) on Tuesday, Anna Marriott, health policy adviser for Oxfam and policy adviser to the People\u2019s Vaccine Alliance said the situation was dire. \u201cIf we look at low-income countries as a whole, shockingly, less than 1% of the total vaccine supply has been delivered to those poorest countries, many of which are in Africa,\u201d she said.\n\u201cPharmaceutical corporations have de-prioritised developing countries, including the continent of Africa,\u201d she said, adding that included de-prioritisation of vaccine-sharing schemes such as Covax and efforts on the part of the African Union to purchase vaccine. \u201cRich countries have pushed themselves to the front of the vaccine queue by willingly paying higher than necessary prices,\u201d she said.\nDr Ayoade Alakija, co-chair of the African Union Africa vaccine delivery alliance for Covid-19 said it was crucial to waive Covid vaccine patents to allow countries to manufacture doses themselves. \u201cThe transfer of technology should be mandated. These vaccines are a public global good; it should be mandated of those companies and there should be absolutely no talk of them losing profits in a pandemic, it is inhumane, it is immoral. And quite frankly, it is also quite stupid,\u201d she said.\nOne problem raised by experts, including Eva Kadilli, director of Unicef\u2019s supply division, was that some vaccines donated by rich nations had a short expiry date. That put huge strain on healthcare systems, which had to scramble to use them in time, while the different storage requirement of the jabs meant there could be logistical problems if vaccines arrived at short notice.\nDr Nicaise Ndembi, chief science adviser to the Africa CDC (the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention), said close to 700,000 vaccines had expired, saying this could add to vaccine hesitancy. \u201cIf people are aware that we\u2019re destroying vaccines, they are sure that something is wrong,\u201d he said.",

Haftar, an American citizen, is insisting he is not liable.\nHe has been credited at various times with the support of Egypt and the United Arab Emirates and has been opposed by Turkey, who backed militias defending Tripoli with fighters and arms.\nHaftar announced his candidacy via a televised address from the eastern city of Benghazi, dressed in a suit and tie rather than military fatigues and projecting himself as an anti-corruption champion.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll change Libya\u2019s future if we place its treasures and riches in the hands of those with integrity,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI declare my candidacy for the presidential election, not because I am chasing power but because I want to lead our people towards glory, progress and prosperity.\u201d\nThe 77-year-old, who said elections were the only way out of Libya\u2019s chaos, said in an interview with Jeune Afrique published in February 2018 that Libya was not yet ripe for democracy, raising doubts about how long Libya would remain a democracy if he won.\nHis chances of winning, assuming the elections occur, have been hit by the decision of Saif Al-Islam Gaddafi to announce on Sunday that he was standing, since both men will be hoping in the east to draw from the same pool of voters. Another figure based in the east, the speaker of the parliament, Aguila Saleh, is also standing.\nHaftar\u2019s candidature, with 40 days to nominal polling day, underlines the chaos that surrounds the elections, with disputes raging over the qualifications of those seeking to stand, the constitutional powers of the president and whether free elections are feasible in a country in which as many as 20,000 foreign forces including mercenaries are on the loose. There are already reports of campaign teams being set up by mercenaries in the east.\nBut the international community recommitted themselves to elections last Friday, and it will probably be down to the US to decide whether the elections will heal Libya\u2019s rifts or exacerbate them. As many as 600 people have applied to stand in the parliamentary elections, and their credentials are now being checked.\nSuch is the chaos over the rules that the national electoral commission on its website appeared to announce that Gaddafi\u2019s application to stand had been rejected, only for the post to be deleted moments later. The commission blamed hacking.\nThe performance of the UN Special Mission in Libya has been widely criticised in recent months for failing to show leadership, placing huge pressure on the administration of Libya\u2019s electoral commission, a largely administrative body, to take charge of a politically fraught contest.",

In a letter to the Speaker published on Tuesday, the prime minister said they should be enshrined in the MPs\u2019 code of conduct so that politicians\u2019 work \u201ccontinues to command the confidence of the public\u201d.\nImplementing both proposals, Johnson said, would \u201cform the basis of a viable approach which could command the confidence of parliamentarians and the public\u201d. He added it was \u201ca matter of regret\u201d the changes had not been implemented already, and voiced his support for them being \u201cadopted as a matter of urgency\u201d.\nWhen the text of the government\u2019s amendment was published, however, it included Labour\u2019s 31 January deadline for final proposal to be made by the standards committee; but omitted the promise of an urgent vote to implement them.\nThe shadow leader of the Commons, Thangam Debbonnaire, called this \u201cdirty tricks\u201d.\nEd Davey, the Liberal Democrat leader, who earns \u00a360,000 a year as a consultant to law firm Herbert Smith Freehills, with the money going towards his disabled son, has given up the role.\nThe Lib Dems are expected to vote in favour of Labour\u2019s plan, rather than that put forward by Johnson.\nJohnson\u2019s move represents a significant about-turn for the prime minister, who has for weeks resisted backing calls for tougher action on MPs\u2019 second jobs. His spokesperson said: \u201cWe have changed our approach in recognition of the strength of feeling and the need to ensure that the public continues to have faith in the strength of the rules that guide parliamentarians.\u201d\nJohnson himself previously edited the Spectator magazine while an MP. When elected as the MP for Uxbridge in May 2015, he was still mayor of London, and remained so until May the following year.\nThe announcement is likely to rile some of the more traditional MPs in his party, who have previously argued that maintaining another job outside politics positively influences the contributions they make in parliament.\nOne minister said the idea was \u201cmadness\u201d and Johnson had been forced into supporting it by failing to quickly contain the row over second jobs, which was sparked three weeks ago by a report that found Paterson breached lobbying rules.\nThe minister complained that what Johnson had proposed was \u201cimpossible to police\u201d and said public interest in the second jobs issue was \u201cfading\u201d \u2013 but Downing Street had instead \u201cgiven it a shot of adrenaline and some turbo boosters\u201d. Another senior Tory MP who makes substantial earnings from other work outside parliament said they had \u201cno idea what the hell [Johnson] is doing\u201d.\nA former Tory minister condemned Johnson\u2019s plans as \u201cback of fag packet stuff\u201d. They said: \u201cThere\u2019s no clarity on whether it means giving up work essential to keeping licences or if it means selling the family business. Who is advising No10 that they have to make a wholesale capitulation to Labour?\u201d\nThe prime minister\u2019s announcement followed a humiliating episode that culminated in the government U-turning on its plan to save Paterson from suspension by approving a report that found he committed an \u201cegregious\u201d breach of lobbying rules, which it had initially blocked.\nOn Tuesday Starmer welcomed Johnson\u2019s acquiescence, but urged him to back Labour\u2019s proposals \u201cin full\u201d and claimed the prime minister had only capitulated due to mounting pressure caused by the media attention on Tory MPs\u2019 second jobs.\nSpeaking at a press conference, Starmer said: \u201cIf he is accepting the motion in full, then that\u2019s a significant victory for us in our work to clean up politics, but obviously I need to look at exactly how he\u2019s put it.\u201d\nPointing to Johnson\u2019s own brushes with the parliamentary standards commissioner, Starmer added: \u201cThe role of the leader, the role of prime minister is to defend and uphold the standards, but \u2026 he sets out deliberately to undermine them, there\u2019s no question about that.\u201d\nThe Labour leader stopped short of saying he would enforce a ban on second jobs for all his MPs immediately or call for similar rules applying to members of the House of Lords.\nChris Bryant, who chairs the standards committee, said people should \u201cstop flapping around like demented chickens\u201d and work was already under way to review the MPs\u2019 code of conduct. He told the Guardian: \u201cWe have a due process. It\u2019s cross-party. It has independent lay members on it \u2013 it\u2019s called the standards committee. We will produce a report before the end of this month in which we will address many of these concerns.\u201d",

        "content": "Evangelising ornithologist who once had the distinction of having seen more bird species in Britain than anyone else\nIan Wallace, who has died aged 87, belonged to the generation of ornithologists who did so much to popularise birdwatching after the second world war. He also made major contributions to two of the most widely read ornithological works of his day: A Field Guide to the Birds of Britain and Europe, which he revised in conjunction with James Ferguson-Lees, and the nine-volume Handbook of the Birds of Europe, the Middle East and North Africa, to which he contributed key sections on field characters and behaviour.\nHis other books included Discover Birds (1979), Birdwatching in the Seventies (1981), Watching Birds (1982), Birds of Prey of Britain and Europe (1983) and a history-cum-memoir, Beguiled By Birds (2004), of which one reviewer wrote: \u201cIt makes you want to bring him home, open a bottle, and sit back as he regales you with stories all night.\u201d Among Ian\u2019s many admirers was Dominic Couzens, a fellow birdwatching author, who praised the way he could express the sheer thrill, with \u201cbinoculars up, heart thumping\u201d of finding a rare bird.\nRare birds were Ian\u2019s lifeblood: from 1963 to 1968 he was chairman of the British Birds Rarities Committee, and by the late 1960s he had seen a wider variety of species in Britain than anyone else. He was also a long-time council member of the RSPB and the British Ornithologists\u2019 Union, and a founder member of the Society of Wildlife Artists, with whom he exhibited his own quirkily distinctive artwork.\nAn only child, Ian was born in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, to Scottish parents, William (known as Jackson), who worked in the fishing industry, and his wife, Elizabeth (nee McKenzie). His father was himself a keen birdwatcher and Ian\u2019s earliest memory was of being shown a puffin on Shetland, at the age of four. He attended Loretto school near Edinburgh, where he was a member of its thriving ornithological society, and on leaving did two years of national service with the King\u2019s African Rifles in Kenya, taking every opportunity to study the exotic local birdlife, along with familiar migrants from home.\nReturning to the UK in the mid-50s, he studied economics and law at Clare College, Cambridge, where he was president of the Cambridge Bird Club, and during the following decade he worked in marketing for a number of companies in a range of industries, claiming to have created the character Captain Birdseye for the company of that name.\nIn 1963 he joined Guy Mountfort, Julian Huxley and other ornithological luminaries on a birdwatching expedition to Jordan that was described in Mountfort\u2019s 1965 book Portrait of a Desert.\nIn 1968 he returned to Africa, spending three years working in the marketing department of Nigerian Breweries in Lagos. While there he undertook a birdwatching expedition to Lake Chad, driving more than 3,300 miles in 12 days and carrying plenty of beer to ensure an easy passage from local officials.\nIn the field his willingness to push the boundaries did sometimes get the better of him, and he had several of his sightings rejected by the British Birds Rarities Committee as \u201cnot proven\u201d. Frustrated, he temporarily withdrew from the birding establishment \u2013 \u201cretired hurt\u201d, as one observer noted rather cuttingly.\nBut Ian\u2019s irrepressible character would not allow him to stay on the sidelines for long, and in 1986 he began writing a regular column for a new magazine, Bird Watching. His witty anecdotes and trenchant opinions soon endeared him to a younger generation of birders, many of whom were, until then, unaware of his achievements. They subsequently benefited personally from Ian\u2019s approachability, encouragement and advice, for he was generous of spirit and perpetually enthusiastic about his hobby.\nHe retired in the late 90s and in later years focused on birdwatching in his local patch, an unremarkable corner of rural Staffordshire, where he continued to find unusual specimens while making careful observations of more common ones.\nEvery August he would also attend Birdfair \u2013 the annual gathering known as the \u201cGlastonbury of birdwatching\u201d \u2013 where he was instantly recognisable in his trademark kilt and tam o\u2019shanter. A dazzlingly inventive public speaker, he would reduce audiences to tears of laughter as he wove increasingly absurd flights of fancy into his dispositions, while still making his point.\nIn 1958 he married Karin Bryde-Williams, and they had two daughters, Petra and Kirstie. They divorced in 1984, and in 1996 he married Wendy Stephens, with whom he had another daughter, Helen. Wendy died in 2020, and he is survived by his daughters and a grandson, Thomas.\n Donald Ian Mackenzie Wallace, birdwatcher, born 14 December 1933; died 4 November 2021",

The average person in the UK owns a \u201ctrainer wardrobe\u201d worth \u00a3474, and most workers own at least seven pairs of trainers and wear them for everything from working to running to going to parties. One in four are aspiring sneakerheads, professing to have up to 10 pairs in their collections.\n\u201cThe pandemic has accelerated the trend, with fewer people required to be in a formal office setting every day,\u201d said the Shoeaholics boss, Mark Hoyal-Mitchell. \u201cBut even those who are returning to formal workplaces are increasingly confident to wear styles of shoe that would have been deemed unacceptable just a few years ago.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a finding that will shock few in the fashion industry, which has been banking on its customers\u2019 collective preference for a more comfortable shoe option for years. Once a symbol of athleticism, trainers have become objects of desire that fit neatly into our demand for clothes that offer aesthetic value and comfort simultaneously.\nWithout question, trainers are now respected attire for formal events and red carpet outings, with everyone from the Duchess of Cambridge to Selena Gomez spotted stepping out in trainers for events.\nThis year the Nomadland film-maker Chlo\u00e9 Zhao attended the Oscars in a pair of all-white sneakers by Hermes, while the US vice-president, Kamala Harris, is regularly photographed in her signature black All Stars.\nWhile sports labels once ruled the market (valued at $70bn in 2020), fashion houses such as Balenciaga and Dior are worthy competitors. The last decade has also seen the launch of a number of new-to-market sneaker brands, including Allbirds, the New Zealand/American company that is a favourite with Barack Obama.\nFor brands associated with contemporary workwear \u2013 among them the London-based Me & Em and Arket, which is part of the H&M group \u2013 trainers are a building block on which an entire aesthetic has been built. These brands regularly position their suiting and formal tailoring pieces with trainers \u2013 stark white styles are preferred.\nA resurgence of classic running shoes, popularised in the 80s, is also essential for those looking to be in step with the style zeitgeist this season.",

The government has beefed up its powers to block the takeover of key national assets under the new National Security and Investment Act.\n\u201cThe government\u2019s commitment to our thriving tech sector is unwavering and we welcome foreign investment,\u201d said Dorries. \u201cBut it is right that we fully consider the implications of the transaction.\u201d\nNvidia moved to buy Arm from Japan\u2019s SoftBank last year in a $40bn (\u00a330bn) cash and shares deal. Nvidia\u2019s share price has rocketed since then, now valuing the deal at $54bn.\nThe California-based firm\u2019s offer for Arm came just as the semiconductor industry made headlines when a global shortage began to disrupt the manufacturing of a swathe of consumer goods from mobile phones to cars, making control of companies in the sector a geopolitical issue.\nArm Holdings, which employs 6,500 staff, including 3,000 in the UK, has about 500 users of its designs worldwide including Apple, Samsung, Qualcomm and Nvidia.\n\u201cWe plan on addressing the CMA\u2019s initial views on the impact of the transaction on competition,\u201d said Nvidia. \u201cAnd we will continue to work with the UK government to resolve its concerns.\u201d\nNvidia, which has pledged not to downsize Arm\u2019s UK operations and to keep its open licensing model, said the deal would \u201chelp accelerate Arm and boost competition and innovation, including in the UK\u201d.\nThe CMA now has 24 weeks to conduct its investigation, although this can be extended by up to eight weeks. The European Commission announced an in-depth inquiry at the end of October.\nMargrethe Vestager, the EU\u2019s executive vice-president in charge of competition and digital policy, said analysis had shown that the deal could \u201clead to restricted or degraded access to Arm\u2019s [intellectual property], with distortive effects on many markets where semiconductors were used\u201d.\nDespite the mounting obstacles to the deal, Masayoshi Son, the chief executive of SoftBank, said this month that he expected the takeover to eventually be cleared.\nNeil Campling, the head of TMT research at Mirabaud, said: \u201cIt has been one-way traffic for the UK silicon industry in recent years. Once a bastion of leading players, many UK semiconductor companies have been sold off to foreign owners. So it is about time the UK realised just how important a key technology enabler based in the country is to the global electronics ecosystem.\u201d\nEarlier this year Boris Johnson stepped in to review the purchase of the UK\u2019s largest producer of semiconductors by a Chinese-owned manufacturer, after being criticised for waving the deal through when the Welsh secretary said he was \u201csatisfied\u201d that security risks had been taken into account.",

It is expected to open on 29 November.\nThe Smartshop Pick & Go store uses the same technology as the six UK Amazon Fresh stores, in which cameras and special weight-sensitive shelves detect when an item has been removed so that shoppers can put their items in a bag or basket and walk out without having to pay at a till.\nCustomers can gain entry to the store in future by generating a QR code via Sainsbury\u2019s SmartShop app, which is currently used to scan items with a mobile phone in its supermarkets.\nIt is the first time Amazon has allowed a retailer in the UK to use its technology, according to Bloomberg.

Tourism provides\u00a0low-paid and largely unrewarding jobs to people\u00a0who struggle to afford to\u00a0live in honeypot areas, even when they have grown up there.\nTourism artificially inflates the cost of living and provides revenue for high-stakes investors, not for middle- or lower-income families. Neither does it help community cohesion, the provision of houses for those who can\u2019t even afford one,\u00a0let alone a second, or give space for other spheres of work.\nThe Lake District national park authority is labouring under a misapprehension.

It has also been critical of the suppression of democracy in Hong Kong and repressive measures in Tibet.\nThe US national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said that Biden raised human rights abuses in his summit with Xi.\n\u201cPresident Biden is always going to be Joe Biden. He is going to be direct and straightforward. And he\u2019s not going to sand down the edges of direct messages on hard issues,\u201d Sullivan told a Brookings Institution video conference assessing the summit on Tuesday.\nLeading Democratic and Republican figures have called for a diplomatic boycott that would send a message of disapproval but would not affect US athletes.\nThe Biden administration will inform allies of its boycott but would leave it to them to make their own decisions.\nMichael Mazza, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, argued that the US and its allies should have pushed much earlier for the Winter Olympics to be taken away from China and held elsewhere. He said that simply refusing to send dignitaries and officials would have no impact on China\u2019s human rights abuses.\n\u201cWe\u2019re now faced with suboptimal options. The one the White House settled on may make us feel good about ourselves, but it shouldn\u2019t. A diplomatic boycott will do little to actually help Uyghurs and other victims of abuses,\u201d Mazza said.\nHe argued a better option would be to send a delegation with the mission of highlighting the plight of the Uyghurs and other victims.\n\u201cThey would be talking to the press every day about what they\u2019re seeing in China,\u201d Mazza said. \u201cThere\u2019s a risk here that, if the United States tried to send a delegation like that, China doesn\u2019t let them into the country. And I say make them do that quite publicly.\u201d\nIn his assessment of the summit, Sullivan suggested the two leaders had agreed in principle to authorise discussions by their officials on major global issues, to reduce risks of misunderstanding and miscalculation. One of those issues would be the nuclear arsenals of both countries.\n\u201cPresident Biden did raise with President Xi the need for a strategic stability set of conversations around [nuclear weapons],\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cThat needs to be guided by the leaders and led by senior empowered teams on both sides that cut across security, technology and diplomacy. And the two leaders agreed that we would look to begin to carry forward discussions on strategic stability.\u201d",

Deliveries to Australia and North America were also delayed by problems with global shipping.\nThe company said it expected to spend \u00a325m in the year as a whole as it invested in its supply chain to improve efficiency.\nShares in the company slid just over 4% as it said total sales fell 6.5% to \u00a3394m in the six months to 2 October and pretax profits fell 39% to \u00a330.7m as shoppers reined in spending at supermarkets and cooking at home to spend their money in restaurants, cafes and workplaces. However, half-year profits were just over double those before the pandemic.\nPremier Foods said it had been able to \u201csuccessfully manage and navigate\u201d challenges from widespread supply chain disruption, including a shortage of lorry drivers and cost inflation, and was on track to deliver profit expectations for the year.\nIt said the cake market had been less affected by big changes in consumer behaviour during the first year of the pandemic while the Covid-related costs had reduced.\nAlex Whitehouse, the chief executive of Premier Foods, said price rises for shoppers were likely next yeargiven higher raw ingredient prices on commodities such as sugar, dairy and wheat. However, he said the company was looking for ways to be more efficient and cut costs to offset inflation.\nWhitehouse said the company intended to pay shareholders a full-year dividend for the second time in over a decade. The payment comes as pretax profits were held up by a steady trading performance and significantly reduced interest costs after the firm cut its debts and refinanced the remainder so it was paying lower interest rates.\n\u201cI am particularly pleased with how well the business is successfully navigating the widely reported industry wide-challenges including logistics, labour shortages and input cost inflation to deliver such a strong set of results, which again underlines the robustness of our operating capabilities,\u201d he said.\nAnalysts said sales and profits at Premier were ahead of expectations.\nThe pandemic has helped revive the company which spent years struggling with heavy debts and pension liabilities. Clive Black, an analyst at Shore Capital, said Premier\u2019s debt reduction was \u201cliberating the group from financing costs and so allowing for greater investment in innovation and marketing\u201d which had helped it gain market share.",

It was most likely deliberately detonated as the car pulled up, Akhavan added, although it was possible that the detonator was accidentally triggered.\nThat would tally with the emerging thinking of investigators who increasingly believe that the hospital itself was the intended target, rather than a Remembrance Sunday parade taking place a few minutes away near Liverpool\u2019s Anglican cathedral.\nThe professor added that after seeing the video of Sunday\u2019s incident she thought there was \u201cno chance\u201d it would be TATP, an unstable explosive made easily from household products and has been used in Islamist attacks in the UK, such as at Manchester Arena in 2017.\n\u201cTATP is very sensitive to detonation,\u201d Akhavan said, adding that she thought the device \u2013 thought to have been made by dead suspect Emad Al Swealmeen \u2013 had failed to properly explode.\nInvestigators are also understood be leaning away from the idea TATP was used on Sunday, although a source familiar with the investigation said they believed the device in the back of the car was nevertheless viable \u201cbecause it made a big bang\u201d. But no final forensic conclusion has been reached as inquiries continue.\nDespite efforts to the contrary, it remains relatively easy to find bomb-making manuals online, particularly by searching on the dark web. However, it is not straightforward to make a bomb and the history of terrorism is littered with failures, a concept sometimes dubbed the Four Lions Factor \u2013 a reference to the 2010 black comedy film that features incompetent terrorists plotting an attack.\nOn many occasions deaths have been averted by such failures, including when shoe bomber Richard Reid tried to blow up an American Airlines flight in 2001. Hundreds of central London clubbers also narrowly escaped after two car bombs designed to be detonated by mobile phone failed to explode in 2008.\nThe Home Office regulates the supply of common explosive precursor chemicals \u2013 and businesses that sell and supply those found in household products, such as hydrogen peroxide, must report suspicious transactions, losses and thefts.",

Most of the United Australia party\u2019s videos have been pulled from YouTube for allegedly violating the tech giant\u2019s advertising policy.

Despite claiming the request was \u201ccomplex\u201d and \u201cvoluminous\u201d, the department released just two of 20 relevant documents after being granted two extensions, and still failed to meet the 4 June 2021 deadline.\nCentrelink\u2019s decision to cancel the age pension of an 80-year-old man who lives in a nursing home with advanced dementia was \u201cabsurd and wrong\u201d, a tribunal has found.

        "content": "Analysis: cricketer tells MPs the name was used to refer to people of colour at Yorkshire club despite it being seen as dehumanising\nAzeem Rafiq\u2019s testimony to MPs detailed the overt and devastating racism that he alleged was the norm at Yorkshire county cricket club. The constant use of the p-word, which was dismissed as banter in its internal investigation, sent shockwaves across the country and became the catalyst for political action.\nBut his allegation to the digital, culture, media and sport committee that players of colour were all called Kevin, which he was asked to explain during his hearing, prompted warnings from leading race equality campaigners. They said, regardless of intention, the result was insidious, and had the same effect \u2013 to disenfranchise and alienate people of colour.\nRafiq fought back tears when he detailed the use of \u201cKevin\u201d at Yorkshire, naming former England batters Gary Ballance and Alex Hales.\nHe told the committee: \u201cKevin was something Gary [Ballance] used to describe anyone of colour in a very derogatory manner. It was an open secret in the England dressing room.\n\u201cAnyone who came across Gary would know that was a phrase he would use to describe people of colour.\u201d\nHe went on to allege he understood that Hales named his dog Kevin because it was black.\nShockat Adam Patel, a volunteer for Muslim Engagement and Development, said: \u201cIt\u2019s the othering of an individual. It takes away a person\u2019s real identity and when you do that, it takes away from the humanity of that individual. And though people think it\u2019s banter or a laugh, you begin to dehumanise someone and don\u2019t care for how they are treated.\n\u201cFor the person affected, they are disenfranchised from the local community and it can cause so many issues for that individual and for wider society.\u201d\nRafiq also claimed Jack Brooks, a two-time County Championship winner at Yorkshire, had started the practice of calling the India star Cheteshwar Pujara \u201cSteve\u201d during an overseas stint at the club.\nJabeer Butt, the chief executive of the Race Equality Foundation, said many people in the UK would have their own examples of being called by a different name, against their wishes. \u201cI can recall from my experience in school where there were boys called Mohammed Iqbal and the head of year forced us to change their names to Tom and Jack.\n\u201cThere were three Stevens in our year and two of them were in our class and it was never raised that they had similar names. But it wasn\u2019t acceptable to have two Mohammed Iqbals. As young children, we were nine or 10, it doesn\u2019t cross your mind that calling them Tom and Jack instead of their real names is problematic.\u201d\nBut it was, Butt added, as it was a constant reminder of being \u201cthe other\u201d and not belonging. \u201cIt\u2019s a sign that, while there has been some progress, it\u2019s not changed completely.\u201d\nThe regular use of the p-word in the workplace was now far less commonthan it had been several decades ago, Butt explained. But the use of Kevin or Steve showed there was still significant progress to be made. \u201cRather than it being the case that we\u2019ve moved on to understand that this is racist and derogatory, we have instead replaced it with something else. The effect is still the same.\u201d\nPatel pointed out that the racism scandal currently engulfing cricket was occurring during Islamophobia awareness month. \u201cOne of the things he [Rafiq] said that resonated was that no one came forward within the community to support him. One of the reasons they don\u2019t is because they feel a sense of helplessness because they fear they can\u2019t beat the system and no one will believe us.\n\u201cAnd what makes this so depressing is, because so much of this is going on, people don\u2019t raise their voices.\u201d\nHe said hoped Rafiq\u2019s testimony finally changed that.",

He is set to leave this week with final details being arranged between himself and the league.\nHe will step down after having become the focus of clubs\u2019 fury over the way the Newcastle deal was approved. Clubs complained they had not been properly consulted over a decision to allow the Saudi sovereign wealth fund to buy the club, having been notified of the outcome by email and only after reports had been published in the media.\nHoffman, 61, wrote the emails and the messages were seen by clubs \u2013 particularly those outside the top six \u2013 to have been a \u201cfinal straw\u201d for their trust in the chairman. A highly respected banker who ran Northern Rock after it was nationalised during the financial crisis, Hoffman\u2019s role at the Premier League is in a non-executive capacity. However, his short tenure has not only coincided with Covid but with the aborted breakaway plans of Project Big Picture and the European Super League, plots which incensed many of the same clubs that eventually wanted him out.\nWhile Richard Masters, the league\u2019s chief executive, is still believed to hold the confidence of most club owners, Hoffman became the object of intense ire at an emergency Premier League board meeting last month and pressure was put on him to stand down. Last week club owners met again informally and held a vote of no confidence in Hoffman which the chairman, unknown to him, failed.\nDuring last Thursday\u2019s official board meeting, where clubs came together to \u201cunanimously\u201d reject plans for a World Cup every two years, Hoffman\u2019s future was not mentioned once. But everyone at the meeting knew the writing was on the wall.\nA former Barclays executive, Hoffman has also worked for Visa Europe and once ran the insurer Hastings. He is also chairman of the digital bank Monzo. He took over as chairman of the Premier League in June 2020 but, what with Covid and the botched attempt to form a European Super League, it has been far from plain sailing.",

        "content": "Testimony to parliament puts big names under scrutiny as former spinner says he was singled out as a \u2018troublemaker\u2019\nEnglish cricket has descended into crisis after Azeem Rafiq\u2019s powerful testimony laid bare its institutional failings on racism, bullying and dressing room culture while also alleging a past drugs cover-up by Yorkshire.\nThis was a day that the sport will never forget \u2013 nor should it \u2013 as Rafiq sat in front of the digital, culture, media and sport select committee and outlined his harrowing experiences at Headingley, summed up by six simple words that must now prove a watershed moment: \u201cI lost my career to racism.\u201d\nFor nearly two hours Rafiq fought back the tears, detailing the dressing room he first entered in 2008 \u2013 one in which phrases such as \u201cPaki\u201d, \u201celephant washers\u201d and \u201cyou lot\u201d were commonplace \u2013 through to his release in 2018, just months after his first child was stillborn and allegations of racism were ignored.\nIt was not about individuals, Rafiq insisted, but rather cricket as a whole, with the former England Under-19s captain claiming he had been told similar stories by players at Leicestershire, Nottinghamshire and Middlesex and describing the \u201cinept\u201d handling of his complaints by the Professional Cricketers\u2019 Association.\nCertainly the panel of MPs chaired by Julian Knight looked to broaden the inquiry, subjecting the England and Wales Cricket Board, led by Tom Harrison, to a stiff interrogation that highlighted the governing body\u2019s record on diversity, its conflict as both regulator and promoter and, ultimately, took a dim view of its inaction after Rafiq first blew the whistle last year.\nNevertheless, names such as Matthew Hoggard, Tim Bresnan, Michael Vaughan, Gary Ballance and Andrew Gale emerged, to varying degrees, as alleged perpetrators during Rafiq\u2019s two spells at Yorkshire between 2008 and 2018, with the former off-spinner starting proceedings and speaking freely without fear of legal reprisal under parliamentary privilege.\nThe devastating allegations portrayed a toxic county dressing room that paused only during Jason Gillespie\u2019s spell as head coach from 2012 to 2016. These were later expanded upon further when the DCMS published the witness statement Rafiq had submitted during the recently settled employment tribunal case; a 57-page document that is, frankly, incendiary.\nIn this Rafiq claimed he was regularly called \u201cRaffa the Kaffir\u201d by Hoggard \u2013 the former England seamer personally apologised for this in 2020 when Rafiq first spoke up in the media \u2013 and bullied by Bresnan. Speaking yesterday, Rafiq said he was among a group of players who reported Bresnan to the club over the bullying allegations, only to find himself singled out and painted as a \u201ctroublemaker\u201d.\nRafiq also gave a heartbreaking retelling of Yorkshire\u2019s indifference to the death of his first child, accusing Martyn Moxon, the director of cricket, of having \u201cripped the shreds off me\u201d on his return to the club and claiming that Gale, who had moved from the role of captain to head coach by this stage, showed no sympathy.\nA running theme of both Rafiq\u2019s oral and written submissions was a sense of being treated differently from white players \u2013 something that has been echoed during recent allegations at Essex \u2013 and at one point in his statement he alleged that Ballance, a player whom he claimed used regular racial slurs in the dressing room, was allowed \u201cto miss drug hair sample tests to avoid sanctions\u201d.\n\u201cWhen he failed a recreational drug test and was forced to miss some games, the club informed the public he was missing games because he was struggling with anxiety and mental health issues,\u201d Rafiq added in his statement. A legal representative for Ballance subsequently denied the allegations.\nThe revelations went beyond the Headingley dressing room, with Rafiq alleging during his evidence session that the use of the word \u201cKevin\u201d by Ballance to describe people of colour had bled into the senior England set-up. Alex Hales, he claimed, was rumoured to have named his black dog accordingly. Either way, the link to the national team will prompt further questions in the coming days.\nRafiq also responded to the recent assertion by Joe Root, the England Test captain, that he could not recall any specific instances of racism during his 14 years at the club. Asked about this, the former off-spinner replied: \u201cRooty is a good man, he\u2019s never engaged in racist language.\n\u201c[But] I found [his comments] hurtful. He was Gary\u2019s flatmate. He was involved in social nights out during which I was called a Paki. He might not remember [the incidents of racism] but it shows how normal it was that even a good man like him doesn\u2019t see it for what it is.\u201d\nAsked if anyone had stood up for him during this time, or when as a 15-year-old at Barnsley Cricket Club he had wine poured down his throat despite this going against his Muslim faith, Rafiq replied: \u201cYou had people who were openly racist and you had the bystanders. No one felt it was important.\u201d\nThis agonising watch was followed by evidence from the former Yorkshire chair, Roger Hutton, and his successor in Lord Kamlesh Patel. Both Mark Arthur, chief executive until last week, and Moxon, currently signed off for stress, had declined the invitation to attend and were criticised for this by Knight.\nIn this Hutton tried to explain the club\u2019s handling of Rafiq\u2019s allegations and the resistance that followed internally when, after a 12-month investigation that began in September 2020, the club\u2019s report was produced. For Hutton the blame here lay with both Arthur and Moxon, the board members whom he claimed were unable to \u201caccept the gravity of the situation\u201d, refused to apologise and would not move on the recommendations that the panel put forward.\nHutton claimed he was unable to stand the pair down as the Graves Family Trust, owed more than \u00a315m by the club, had a veto on board members. After this apparent blockade was scrutinised by the MPs, and later bemoaned by Harrison despite previously working under Colin Graves at the ECB, Hutton was asked if Yorkshire was institutionally racist and replied: \u201cI fear it falls into that definition.\u201d\nThis conclusion was further than Harrison was prepared to go, with the ECB chief executive insisting only the handling of Yorkshire\u2019s investigation into Rafiq\u2019s claims could be described as such and stressing the convoluted process by which the governing body, as the sport\u2019s regulator, could not step in sooner.\nBy this stage Harrison, joined by two executives and the ECB board member Alan Dickinson, had already infuriated his interrogators with indirect answers that were riddled with corporate jargon. This contrasted hugely with Rafiq\u2019s earlier testimony, spoken without notes, from the heart and in everyday language, despite having little of the same training.\n\u201cI want to become the voice for the voiceless,\u201d the 30-year-old had said. In a sport in which 30% of the recreational game is made up by the British Asian community, only to see this drop to 4% at professional level, this may prove to be his legacy.",

        "content": "While Rafiq spoke with bravery and honesty about his pain, Tom Harrison offered only evasion and self-preservation\nIt seems that Yorkshire County Cricket Club were right about Azeem Rafiq all along. He really is a natural-born leader. Just not in the way they\u2019d hoped.\nOn Tuesday morning Rafiq sat for an hour and three quarters in the parliamentary committee room of the digital, culture, media and sport select committee. He spoke for most of that time, stopping occasionally to gather himself. In the process he delivered a devastating, fearlessly detailed description of institutional racism shared live and unedited with the British public.\nThe issues are, of course, the thing here. But it was hard not to marvel at Rafiq\u2019s performance. He was electrifying. His evidence was forensic, brutal when required and heart-rendingly honest. Rafiq took a committee designed to take evidence, and a room filled with MPs paid to opine and preach, and simply overwhelmed the whole process with his testimony. So this, then, is what it takes: the strength required to get to this point.\nLooking on it was hard not to think about Rafiq as a young Yorkshire cricketer, so highly rated that he captained Joe Root in the under-15s, and was referred to even in Michael Vaughan\u2019s doomed mea non culpa in the Daily Telegraph as someone who \u201cgot Yorkshire going. He was full of energy and buzz\u201d. Right first time. Rafiq has had to crawl through darkness to get to this point. But he is, in his own unintended way, a true sporting hero.\nThere was a startling point of contrast later in the day as the chief executive of the England and Wales Cricket Board, Tom Harrison, gave evidence and produced a wretched show of prevarication, flannel and non-speak buzzwords. Truth? Meet bluster. Corporate evasion? Meet the real-life consequences of your inactions. Quite how Harrison managed to avoid walking into that room already penitent, pleading forgiveness for the harm that has continued to flourish during his own regulation of the summer sport, is the acme of shamelessness.\nRafiq had appeared promptly at 9.33am, sat in a pressed shirt and looking a little anxious as Julian Knight MP invited him to get things rolling. Which he did, to devastatingly lucid effect.\nStraight away we were into specifics of the abuse he suffered at Yorkshire. \u201cElephant washers\u201d. \u201cYou lot sit over there.\u201d Constant use of the P-word. The term \u201cKevin\u201d was raised, an insult given to any non-white person; and, Rafiq understood, to a black dog owned by the England batsman Alex Hales. Banter. That\u2019s all it is.\nRafiq talked about being held down by another Yorkshire cricketer when he was 15 while playing for his local club and having red wine poured down his throat. Rafiq is Muslim. He had never drunk alcohol before. John Nicolson, an SNP MP, asked if no one intervened. Rafiq explained calmly and tolerantly how it works. \u201cThat\u2019s the institution. You have people who are openly racist. And then you have the bystanders. Lots of people saw it happen. No one felt strong enough to say stop.\u201d\nThere was real pain at the allegations against Martyn Moxon, Yorkshire\u2019s head of cricket, who \u201cliterally ripped the shreds off me\u201d the day after Rafiq returned to work following the death of his stillborn child. He explained how he went through every mechanism, how he wept in front of the inclusivity and diversity board member, but still nothing happened.\nThere were some warm words for Jason Gillespie, and for Joe Root too, even as Rafiq half-buried him by pointing out that, contrary to what Root has seemed to claim, the England captain was present on nights out when all this was flying around. \u201cIt was the norm. That\u2019s probably why some people don\u2019t even remember it.\u201d\nHe pointed out how unhelpful it is to say \u201cthis is a societal problem\u201d, the kind of weary shrug that offers no help at all when you are facing a specific problem. By the end there was a warning, too, against sloganeering solutions, the ECB\u2019s \u201cPR initiatives, telling everyone how great they are\u201d. \u201cWe are sick and tired of these inquiries and commissions. All we\u2019re asking is to be treated fairly. The ECB need to take responsibility in their own house. It is their game.\u201d\nIn the process, walking through the most painful evidence with such grace and clarity, Rafiq provided something else too, a parable of how racism hurts everyone. Imagine another timeline where all this courage, this intelligence, did not have to be wasted on dealing with other people\u2019s bigotry, with managing your own pain. What a waste of talent, what a diversion from happiness.\nAt which point, enter the ECB. To move from Rafiq\u2019s testimony to the blurted responses of the sport\u2019s governing body was to step from the light into a murkier world of self-preservation and double-speak. To watch Harrison attempt to field basic, utterly foreseeable questions was to see an executive embarrassingly ill-equipped to deal with his brief. Here we had a salesman asked to speak to issues of character, culture and morality and simply drawing a blank.\nStraight off Harrison was asked how it was possible the ECB, as keepers of the game, allowed Yorkshire to produce their own report into whether they were racist or not. \u201cYorkshire were very clear they wanted to run this investigation themselves,\u201d he replied. Tom, listen to me. They\u2019re the accused.\nFor a while we entered a world of T-shirt politics, of basic phoniness. There was talk of \u201ca hard listening exercise\u201d (oh yeah?) of \u201cdrilling into the real issues\u201d. Harrison suggested to the committee of MPs that the ECB had responded the instant it became clear there was a problem at Yorkshire. This despite the fact Rafiq first spoke to him about these issues in August 2020. Does that qualify as a half-truth?\nHe promised he would \u201clook into dressing-room culture\u201d. We heard that the word \u201cKevin\u201d would \u201cnow form part of the ECB investigation\u201d. Cut to a shot of Harrison frowning over a notepad with the word \u201cKevin??\u201d underlined twice. Invetigation in progress.\nDisappointingly, none of the MPs present felt like mentioning the \u00a32.1m bonus Harrison will be sharing with his fellow ECB executives for nurturing the game. Again, that shamelessness. In any functioning public sports body there would be serious consideration of Harrison\u2019s position. It is his job, and his duty, to regulate this culture. What we have here is an institutional failure.\nAnd really, no one in that room gets to act surprised. This committee hearing was taking place 24 years on from the first ECB report into institutional racism in cricket, the first list of recommendations, the first stern warnings against complacency, the first questions in parliament. Zoom out a little further and Rafiq\u2019s evidence was given in front of inquisitors apparently unaware that, like the jurors in Twelve Angry Men, it is they who are also on trial here; that this is about culture and power, about the society our representatives oversee.\n\u201cWould you help Yorkshire to get its sponsorship back?\u201d Rafiq was asked, apparently seriously, at one point. He waited just long enough. \u201cIf that\u2019s the mindset I would be very hesitant.\u201d At moments like that you saw the pain. Rafiq cried a few times during his evidence but was able to talk without missing a beat about the online abuse of his wife, his sister, the illness of his father. This has been the price of pushing, and occasionally dragging, everyone present into that room. Only actions, not empty words, will satisfy now.",

I keep saying it, we are decent. We wanted to finish the campaign on a high and I think you saw the way we approached the game was very positive.\u201d\nThat the Danes, who had won nine qualifiers out of nine before visiting Glasgow, were defeated by Scotland was one thing. The cohesion and technical strength of the Scottish performance turned heads. They were comfortable 2-0 winners. Late June, when Scotland were bundled out of Euro 2020 having claimed only a single point in the group phase, felt like a lifetime ago as Hampden Park partied.\n\u201cWe have come a long way in a short space of time and it\u2019s great, so let\u2019s just enjoy it,\u201d Clarke added. \u201cIt has been a good campaign. It was nice to take part in our first tournament. I don\u2019t know if anyone remembers but I did say at the time I felt we would come out of that tournament as a better team and better squad. I think we have proved that. I think we have improved as a team for the fact that we have been together. We got criticised for the tournament but we learned at the tournament and that was important.\u201d\nWhere is it? Qatar, with eight stadiums staging fixtures. The 80,000-seat Lusail Iconic Stadium will host a number of key games including the final.\u00a0\nWhen is it? 21 November to 18 December 2022. Top-flight leagues around the world will schedule a winter break to accommodate it.\nWho has qualified so far?\u00a0So far thirteen of the 32 teams are confirmed: Qatar (as hosts), Germany, Denmark, Brazil, Belgium, England, France, Croatia, Netherlands, Spain, Serbia, Switzerland and Argentina.\u00a0\nWhen are the draws? The draw for the finals themselves is scheduled to take place in Doha on 1 April 2022. The draw for the European play-offs will be held in Zurich on Friday 26 November 2021.\nSeeded\u00a0Portugal, Scotland, Italy, Russia, \nSweden, Wales.\u00a0\nUnseeded\u00a0Turkey, Poland, North Macedonia,\nUkraine, Austria (via Uefa Nations League), Czech Republic (via UNL).\nClarke reserved special praise for John Souttar, who headed in Scotland\u2019s first goal against Denmark. The Hearts centre-back has battled back from three serious achilles injuries, including two in three years, to return to international football. Numerous Championship clubs in England have designs on the 25-year-old, who is out of contract in Edinburgh next summer.\n\u201cJohn Souttar was the story of the night,\u201d said Clarke. \u201cI\u2019m so happy for him. I gave him a big hug when he came off and I could have cried. Two years fighting back from the kind of injuries John had? To come back in the squad, he was made up, to get the chance to play and to play like that \u2013 I\u2019m not talking about the goal, the goal was icing on the cake, because to play like that, I\u2019m so pleased for him.\u201d\nClarke said he has not considered whether it is worthwhile asking for domestic fixture leeway from authorities before the play-offs. The manager does not expect to see his squad collectively again for four months.\n\u201cWe sort of discussed if we could get together but it\u2019s so difficult,\u201d said Clarke. \u201cI\u2019ll wander around, watch all the games, keep an eye on them and keep in touch with them, without interfering too much in their club business. Now they go away, they can concentrate on their clubs and we pick up the reins again in March.\u201d",

But with presages of ill-tidings beginning to come to the fore, automatic qualification for Qatar appears dangerously close to slipping through their fingers.\nA week on from on a Saudi Arabia stalemate that dampened a homecoming more than two years in the making, Australia\u2019s surprise 1-1 draw with China, combined with Japan\u2019s subsequent 1-0 win over Oman in Muscat, saw Graham Arnold\u2019s side drop outside their group\u2019s two automatic qualification slots for the first time.\nMemories of the record-setting 11-game winning streak is now naught but a distant memory, and the Australians inability to dispatch a side they comfortably dealt with 3-0 in September means they are now winless in their last three fixtures. They are also a point behind a Japanese team that, despite ongoing questions surrounding why they can\u2019t turn their collection of fearsome individual talent into consistent team performances, are themselves on a three-game winning run.\nFurther, after missing a chance to overhaul them for top-spot at a sodden Parramatta Stadium, they are five adrift of group leaders Saudi Arabia, who dispatched Vietnam 1-0 in Hanoi in their overnight fixture. Coach Herv\u00e9 Renard\u2019s side would be doing Australia a favour with wins against Oman and Japan during the next international window in January but, in doing so, would all but take one of the two qualification spots in Group B off the table.\n\u201cFrustrating, always, when you go 1-0 up and then you concede and finish with a draw,\u201d Mitch Duke, who headed home Australia\u2019s goal in the 38th minute only to then watch on as Wu Lei dispatched a VAR-adjudicated penalty in the 70th minute, told Network Ten. \u201cIt was an important game that we needed three points [from] and very frustrating to go away with just the one.\u201d\nWith a home fixture against the Blue Samurai still to come in March next year, kickstarting another winning streak that takes them through the end of this phase of qualification would ensure Arnold\u2019s men progression to next year\u2019s showcase regardless of what Japan do in their other games but, undoubtedly, the Socceroos\u2019 quest for a fifth straight World Cup stands upon the edge of a knife. Stray but a little and it will fail.\nMore concerning than prognostications over scenarios, though, is that Wednesday morning\u2019s exploration in bluntness came against one of the weakest sides remaining in Asian qualifying. Coach Li Tie\u2019s side sat second bottom of Group B coming into the meeting \u2013 played at the neutral Sharjah Stadium due to China\u2019s continued quarantine requirements for international arrivals \u2013 and had been thoroughly outplayed by the Socceroos in their previous meeting, also staged on neutral ground, in Doha.\nDuke continued to do Mitch Duke things as he headed his side ahead in the 38th minute, but the Socceroos persistent inability to unlock an embedded defence came back to haunt them; ultimately descending into a layer of cross-spam that only deepened when desperation and urgency increased after China\u2019s equaliser.\nThe signs of this bluntness and an over-reliance on crossing has been hinted at since the Socceroos returned to play in June after their long Covid-enforced absence but, given such omens came during a world record-setting run of wins, there was a certain level of angst in determining just how much of a problem they were and how much attention could be brought to them.\nWhen a side is winning, World Cup qualification looks a sure thing and new stars are emerging amid an overall hopeful and aspirational spirit in the local football scene, it\u2019s difficult to draw much attention to the intricacies of ratios of Xg per shot or successful dribbles in the opponents final third.\nThese issues may have been swept under the carpet but the stalemate in China should now force the Socceroos to confront them. If they do, it would not be unreasonable to envisage wins over Vietnam and Oman in the fixtures preceding Japan\u2019s trip to Australia, combined with three points away to a Saudi side that, by the end of March might have put their cue in the rack. But they\u2019ll need steady hands.",

He brings a calm, consistent and experienced component to the batting lineup and is a proven run-scorer at Test level,\u201d the chairman of selectors, George Bailey, said.\n\u201cHe also has the ability to bat across a range of positions in the batting order.\nKhawaja said he was excited after getting the phone call from Bailey on Tuesday morning, but he tempered that with a touch of realism. \u201cPlaying for Australia is always an honour and being selected in the 15-man squad is obviously an honour too,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI\u2019m excited but it\u2019s still business as usual \u2013 we\u2019re still in the middle of the season \u2013 so you can\u2019t get too far ahead of yourself.\u201d\nHead also started the domestic season in good nick, but has fallen away in recent outings, scoring one half-century in his past six innings.\n\u201cTravis finished last summer strongly, second only to Cameron Green for runs scored, and has again started the season well,\u201d Bailey said. \u201cHe drives the game forward and can put the opposition under pressure with his ability to score quickly.\u201d\nOtherwise, the team to face England\u2019s tourists at the Gabba from 8 December and then in Adelaide for the day-night Test starting on 16 December appears to be settled, with incumbent Test opener Marcus Harris to partner David Warner at the top of the order.\nHarris\u2019s development at Leicestershire convinced selectors to retain him, Bailey said. \u201cHe is a good player who will be looking to build a strong partnership with David Warner at the top of the order.\u201d\nAt the other end of the teamsheet, the pace trio Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Starc will only be displaced in the event of injury or fitness concerns, with Jhye Richardson the most likely to step in if needed.\nRichardson was included along with the uncapped fast bowler Michael Neser and leg-spinner Mitchell Swepson in a squad that was well-balanced, Bailey said, with a \u201cmix of experienced, proven performers and emerging, developing talent\u201d.\nSix players from the T20 World Cup-winning team \u2013 who arrived back in Australia on Tuesday \u2013 feature in the squad and Cummins expects the confidence off the back of Australia\u2019s success in the 20-over format to flow into the red-ball series.\nThe Test vice-captain said: \u201cIt\u2019s a different format but you saw somebody like Davey Warner, player of the tournament, that\u2019s going to have huge confidence for him going into the summer.\n\u201cAs an Australian side, we all probably felt like we\u2019ve underperformed a little bit in the last few years, haven\u2019t won as many games as we\u2019d probably expect.\n\u201cTo get back out and win a title on the world stage \u2026 it can be era-defining for a side.

Fauci said if a lot more Americans take the vaccines, and if the US makes boosters available for everyone, the country could get control of the virus by spring of 2022.\nBut with his forecast Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the chief medical adviser to Joe Biden, was acknowledging what experts now widely believe: that Covid-19 cannot be eliminated and will probably become endemic, meaning it will always be present in the population to some degree, such as the flu or chickenpox.\nBooster doses of the vaccines are vital for reaching the point where falling infection rates allow the disease to be downgraded from the current pandemic public health emergency to the status of endemic, Fauci explained in an interview on Tuesday during the Reuters Total Health conference.\n\u201cTo me, if you want to get to endemic, you have got to get the level of infection so low that it does not have an impact on society, on your life, on your economy,\u201d Fauci said.\n\u201cPeople will still get infected. People might still get hospitalized, but the level would be so low that we don\u2019t think about it all the time and it doesn\u2019t influence what we do.\u201d\nEven to get to that point, many more people need to take the vaccine for the first time and others need to get boosters, he added.\nBooster shots are currently available \u2013 at least six months after completing prior vaccination \u2013 to the immunocompromised, those 65 and older and other people at high risk of severe disease or frequent exposure to the virus through their jobs or living situations.\nSome states and New York City have already expanded booster availability more widely than the federal recommendations.\nAn influential US panel that advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will discuss on Friday expanding eligibility for booster shots to all adults, which could make the shots available as early as this weekend.\n\u201cLook what other countries are doing now about adopting a booster campaign virtually for everybody. I think if we do that \u2026 by the spring we can have pretty good control of this,\u201d Fauci said.\nThere is a wide range of opinion as to what might be considered getting the virus under control, Fauci noted.\n\u201cYou could control it at 50,000 cases a day. To me, that\u2019s not good control, and that\u2019s not endemicity that I would accept.\u201d\nHe disagrees with those who argue that it is time to start learning to live with the virus all around us all the time.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to sit back when we have 70,000 to 85,000 new infections a day and say, \u2018Oh, well, we can\u2019t do any better than that. Let\u2019s live with that.\u2019 Sorry, that\u2019s not where we want to be,\u201d he said.\nThat is why he keeps pushing to get as many people vaccinated as possible.\n\u201cFor me, endemicity means a lot more people get vaccinated, a lot more people get boosted, and although you don\u2019t eliminate or eradicate it, that infection is not dominating your life,\u201d he said.\nThe number of new Covid cases is rising in more than half of US states amid fears of another winter surge. Infections were firmly falling from mid-September to late October but the US is now averaging more than 83,000 cases a day, up 14% from a week ago, NPR reported on Tuesday.\nMinnesota has the worst infection rate in the US over the last week, the Star Tribune reported, and Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota\u2019s center for infectious disease research and policy warned that the \u201cwhole midwest is lighting up\u201d with new coronavirus cases.",

It said the campaign was designed to falsely imply it was suing Stolz as retribution for him blowing the whistle.\nThe federal court earlier this year considered whether it needed to restrain Stolz using an injunction to prevent his comments from interfering in the administration of justice and causing contempt of court.\nStolz\u2019s lawyers had argued the public commentary had not interfered with the administration of justice.\nBut Justice David Yates on Wednesday ordered Stolz be restrained.\n\u201cAs to injunctive relief, I\u2019m satisfied, based on Mr Stolz\u2019s past conduct, that [ClubsNSW] has demonstrated a real threat that Mr Stolz will, unless restrained, continue to engage in that conduct or conduct of a similar kind,\u201d he said.\nThe order proposed by the court would restrain Stolz from saying anything about the conduct of ClubsNSW in the case that is calculated to \u201cintimidate, harass, or otherwise bring improper pressure on the respondent\u201d.\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nClubsNSW had sought for an order \u201crestraining public statements, including to the media, about the applicant\u2019s purpose in maintaining the proceeding against the respondents and its conduct in the proceeding\u201d.\nThe court said that was too broad.\nYates said the orders would not stop the applicant from speaking publicly about the case.\nBut he said Stolz would now need to \u201ctread carefully\u201d.\n\u201cFor its compliance, the injunction the applicant seeks does no more than call for the exercise of the judgment which must be exercised in any event if, for example, one wishes to take the step of commenting publicly on the course of litigation or on the conduct of a party in, or in respect of, that litigation,\u201d he said. \u201cIf this is the path that Mr Stolz chooses to take, there is no restraint on him doing so.\u201d\n\u201cBut, if he wishes to continue on that path, he must tread carefully.\u201d\nThe court had previously heard that Stolz had retweeted a tweet suggesting a conflict of interest in the court\u2019s consideration of the injunction. That was described by ClubsNSW as \u201cdeeply irresponsible\u201d and Stolz\u2019s lawyers apologised to the court for the conduct and said the tweet was without any foundation.\nStolz has also had communications with independent MP Andrew Wilkie\u2019s office about a ClubsNSW report on the handling of money laundering laws by registered clubs.\nWilkie subsequently raised the matter in parliament and attempted to table a document given to him by Stolz.\nClubsNSW attempts to obtain the Wilkie correspondence has prompted an intervention from parliament\u2019s powerful privileges committee, which found the federal court case may breach the privilege attached to communications between an MP and their constituents.\nStolz did not press a claim for privilege over the documents.",

Hunt was happy to talk up the scheme as a way to force companies to cut emissions.\nThis mechanism is worth a close look at because energy, industry and emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, on Wednesday preemptively attacked Labor, should the opposition make the foolhardy move of implementing government policy, introducing a backdoor carbon price in the process.\n\u2018\u2018The safeguard mechanism was never meant to be a tool to force businesses to reduce their emissions \u2013 which is a carbon tax by stealth,\u2019\u2019 Taylor was reported in today\u2019s Australian Financial Review as saying.\nFirst up, it\u2019s shape-shifted many times, making it less likely to safeguard anything.\nThe scheme was originally designed explicitly to prevent emissions rising from big polluters thereby undoing the work of the billions of dollars being forked out by taxpayers via the Emissions Reduction Fund.\nEmitters such as miners, oil and gas companies, and manufacturers were covered by this mechanism, with a facility pollution threshold set at 100,000 tonnes a year of carbon dioxide-equivalent (CO2-e).\nA limit, also known as a baseline, was applied to such facilities. If owners exceeded that cap, they were supposed to buy carbon credits to offset those extra emissions or pay a penalty.\nSounds almost like a cap and trade market that identifies a carbon price.\nHowever, as Guardian Australia has reported here and here, polluters have largely dodged paying a penalty, and big polluters\u2019 emissions have kept rising.\nChange the baseline and you can neuter the mechanism.\nAs noted by an adviser to The Australia Institute and former industry department staffer, Polly Hemming, the initial baselines were set according to historical emissions.\nNow, though, instead of absolute tonnes of CO2-e, updated methods have baselines set according to emissions intensity, such as how much pollution resulted per tonne of coal dug up at a mine.\nThese baselines now increase or fall in proportion to expected production, she says.\nTennant Reed, who runs climate, energy and environment policy for the Australian Industry Group, last year summed up progress so far: \u201cIf it never has to do something to actually reduce emissions it will have been a waste of time for everyone involved,\u201d he says.\nQuite possibly.\nThe Morrison government set aside almost $280m in its 2021 budget to implement recommended changes after a review by Grant King, previously the head of the Business Council of Australia (BCA), (remember this organisation, we\u2019ll come back to them.)\nThese included the creation of rewards if emissions intensity fell below existing baselines. Large emitters would get \u201cSafeguard Mechanism Credits\u201d (SMC) that they could then trade if pollution sank below agreed limits. \n \u201cThis government legislated the stick of the safeguard mechanism,\u201d Hemming says. \u201cNow they\u2019re trying to paint it orange and pretend it\u2019s a carrot.\u201d\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nHemming argues the new type of credit won\u2019t be treated as the equivalent of existing Australian Carbon Credit Units, setting up the prospect of a two-tiered market.\n\u201cWe are throwing so much public money at \u2018incentivising\u2019 emissions reduction by big polluters,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not working and it\u2019s punishing the businesses who genuinely have invested in serious abatement.\u201d\n The only upside is that the SMC could form the basis of a cap and trade market that Labor could adopt if it wins office. This prospect may be why Taylor is on the attack. (His Labor counterpart was approached for comment.)\nThe BCA does, sort of.\nThe same group that famously attacked Labor\u2019s 2019 election pledge of cutting 2005-level emissions 45% as \u201ceconomy wrecking\u201d now thinks 46-50% is doable.\nThe Morrison government is adamant it won\u2019t be taking a target higher than 26-28% to the next elections. That\u2019s despite signing up to the Glasgow Cop26 pact that requests nations lift that 2030 goal by next year. Labor is yet to decide on a near-term target.\nThe Safeguard Mechanism, the business lobby group now says, is just the tonic \u201cto deliver a strong carbon investment signal\u201d.\nIt calls for lowering the eligibility threshold so that entities emitting 25,000t CO2-e a year will be captured. Those baselines should be lowered \u201cpredictably and gradually over time\u201d, with various exclusions, such as firms exposed to international rivals who may not face similar carbon restrictions.\nBut while it backs the application of the mechanism, the group\u2019s first choice is a climate policy that most economists favour but major political parties won\u2019t go near, noting: \u201can explicit, economy-wide carbon pricing mechanism is the Business Council\u2019s preferred option\u201d.\nAnd so, we come full circle.",

I think that\u2019s a good motto for us to follow not just in this area, but right across the spectrum of economic policy in this country. We\u2019ve got a bit used to governments telling us what to do over the last couple of years. I think we have to break that habit.\u201d\nBut what does \u201ccan-do capitalism\u201d mean? Will \u201cno sweat neoliberalism\u201d be next?\nThe meaning of \u201ccan do\u201d really depends on what part of the world you\u2019re in. In America, it tends to mean you have a confident and optimistic approach to challenges. In the UK, it\u2019s someone who you can count on to take on a task, no matter the challenges. In Queensland, it brings to mind one-term LNP premier Campbell Newman. And in Morrison\u2019s world, it is the latest slogan to describe how to do nothing while appearing to offer solutions.\nIn all likelihood, can-do capitalism will have a short life as a campaign soundbite, as it is merely an extension of \u201ctechnology not taxes\u201d \u2013 the other three-word slogan the government dreamed up to sell its climate policy.\nNeither are true. The government has committed at least $20bn to encouraging the market to step in and solve Australia\u2019s emissions reduction issue, money which will come from taxes. The government\u2019s own plan to support industry involves legislating funds through the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, which Tony Abbott attempted to abolish in 2015.\nBut even relying on the free market to step in and solve a challenge for a government involves an interventionist approach \u2013 something the Coalition, the party of \u201csmall government\u201d and champion of free enterprise, regularly engages in.\nIn just one example, Australia \u2013 recently named the \u201ccolossal fossil\u201d of the Glasgow climate talks by climate activists \u2013 continues to subsidise fossil fuels.\nA report released by the Australia Institute earlier this year found that federal and state subsidies for coal, oil and gas projects came to more than $10bn in spending and tax breaks for fossil fuel industries. And that is before the \u201cgas led recovery\u201d intervention the government is planning, to expand the use of gas in the Australian electricity market. Under the government\u2019s own \u201cmodelling\u201d, the Australian fossil fuel gas industry is expected to be 13% higher than 2020 by 2050.\nIn fact, there are a lot of \u201cdon\u2019t dos\u201d in the government\u2019s \u201ccan do\u201d gas plan, including setting up new gas supply targets for states and territories with \u201cuse it or lose it\u201d requirements on gas licences, to get more projects going more quickly.\nThe Coalition has a solid track record in imposing \u201cdon\u2019t do\u201d regulation on some people when it suits them, such as the Indue cashless welfare program, which limits where welfare recipients can shop, and what they can purchase with their social security funds.\nIt also has many \u201cdon\u2019t dos\u201d for the national broadcaster, with its latest \u2013 a Senate inquiry into the ABC\u2019s complaint process \u2013 receiving a strong rebuke from ABC chair Ita Buttrose.\nJohn Roskam, an executive director of the Institute of Public Affairs, has accused the Coalition government of drifting towards a European-style Social Democratic Party, in terms of \u201cthe level of government regulation of the labour market the Liberals accept\u201d.\nNow, after failing to provide certainty for investors in the renewables market, while continuing to subsidise the fossil fuel industry, Morrison has palmed off the responsibility for Australia meeting its climate responsibilities to the private sector.\n\u201cThe world\u2019s companies are going to solve this problem because they\u2019re the ones who make electric cars,\u201d he told Nine newspapers. \u201cThey\u2019re the ones who make hydrogen and use it and create energy.

Guardian Australia understands Debt Negotiators was not named in that research.\nUp to 1.9 million Australians paid debt management firms for help in 2020, according to a report released by the Consumer Action Law Centre (Calc) in December that described the sector as \u201cdebt vultures\u201d.\nCalc chief executive Gerard Brody said it was \u201cgreat to see Asic take this action\u201d.\n\u201cPeople have also complained about this business to our centre,\u201d he said.\nHe expressed concern about Asic\u2019s allegations that Debt Negotiators threatened to contact relatives of clients.\n \nEmail:\u00a0sign up for our\u00a0daily morning and afternoon email newsletters\nApp:\u00a0download our free app\u00a0and never miss the biggest stories\nSocial:\u00a0follow us on YouTube,\u00a0TikTok,\u00a0Instagram,\u00a0Facebook\u00a0or\u00a0Twitter\nPodcast:\u00a0listen to our daily episodes on\u00a0Apple Podcasts,\u00a0Spotify\u00a0or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app\n\u201cThe conduct in the claim is horrific,\u201d he said.\nIn its December report, Calc said the sector was largely unregulated and called for protections similar to those in the UK, where advice must be in the client\u2019s best interests and tailored to their circumstances.\nFees charged in advance should also be banned, Calc said.\nFrom 1 July this year debt management companies have been required to hold a credit license and be a member of the Australian Financial Complaints Authority scheme \u2013 changes Calc said did not go far enough.\nDebt Negotiators meets both obligations, according to its website.",

But insiders said on Tuesday \u201cit was still possible\u201d investigators would not find any ideological trigger for the attack.\nEarlier the security minister, Damian Hinds, told Sky News that while counter-terrorism police were discovering \u201cmore by the hour\u201d about Swealmeen, it \u201ccould be weeks\u201d before the full picture of \u201chow this came about and what the motivation was\u201d became apparent.\nIt is understood that Swealmeen, who had been in the UK for about seven years, had an asylum claim rejected in December 2020. When a previous claim was rejected, several years earlier, he suffered mental ill-health and was sectioned, according to a friend in the city, Malcolm Hitchcott.\nInvestigators also do not believe the explosive used on Sunday was TATP, an unstable compound that can be made from consumer products, and which has been used by a number of Islamist attackers, most notably in the 7 July 2005 attacks on London\u2019s transport system.\nNevertheless, there remain concerns that there have been two attacks in a month, with Sunday\u2019s incident coming soon after the killing of Sir David Amess, a Conservative MP, at his constituency surgery in Essex.\nOne source with knowledge of the thinking of counter-terrorism chiefs said there was real concern that the two violent incidents could embolden those thinking of attempting a fresh atrocity.\nSuch concerns helped underpin the decision on Monday to lift the terror threat level to severe, meaning a fresh attempt at an atrocity is deemed highly likely.\nThe source pointed to a similar effect in 2017 when the first attack in March of that year on parliament was followed a series of others in quick succession, three with a jihadist motive and one with an extreme far-right motive.\nA counter-terrorism source told the Guardian: \u201cThere have been two terror incidents in the last four weeks, and we\u2019ve seen how that can encourage or embolden other extremists.\u201d\nThe second part of the concern among senior counter-terrorism officers is that any spurring on of violent extremists would come as more people are out and about in the run-up to Christmas, for the first time since the pandemic struck.\n\u201cWe\u2019re heading into our first proper Christmas since the start of the pandemic and our towns and cities are going to be incredibly busy, so the cooperation from the public in fighting the threat is going to be vital,\u201d the counter-terrorism source added.\nOfficers specialising in fighting violent extremism are going to exhort the public to report concerns about potential attack plots and say that of 10,000 calls to a counter-terrorism hotline every year, a fifth yield useful intelligence and potentially save lives.\nPolice forces are putting on extra patrols, and arrangements for protective security \u2013 that is, making it harder for terrorists to attack \u2013 are being reviewed, including for hospitals.",

        "content": "Ridley Scott\u2019s House of Gucci stars Lady Gaga in a tale of fashion and murder. But is true crime \u2013 once the soul of cinema, from thrillers and horrors to westerns \u2013 now outgrowing the big screen?\nWhat took you so long, House of Gucci? This story was destined to become a movie from the moment the bullet left fashion heir Maurizio Gucci dead outside his Milan office in March 1995 \u2013 shot, a witness said, by a hitman with a \u201cbeautiful, clean hand\u201d. The film by Ridley Scott now finally arrives dripping with star power, and Lady Gaga as Gucci\u2019s ex-wife Patrizia Reggiani. But the story alone was enough: a glittering tickbox of money, revenge and a villainess kept company in jail by an illicit pet ferret called Bambi.\nTrue crime gold. So why, now that the film is actually here, does the Gucci case feel a strange fit for a movie after all? Put it down to timing. The film\u2019s development began in entertainment prehistory: 2006. Back then, a lavish movie was still the grand prize for any news story, and true crime \u2013 that trashbag genre \u2013 would simply be glad of the association. Now though, film and true crime have the air of an estranged couple. Had Maurizio Gucci been gunned down on Via Palestro last week, Netflix would already have the rights and the podcast would be on Spotify.\nSuch is how true crime conquered the world. The vast success of the 2014 podcast Serial remains the origin story, but the peak never seems to come. The genre has become bigger than the movies \u2013 made that way by an interlocking partnership with pods and streaming.\n\u201cWhen I started studying true crime, nobody took it seriously,\u201d says New York writer Jean Murley, who in 2008 published The Rise of True Crime: 20th Century Murder and American Popular Culture. \u201cNow it feels like the dominant form of pop culture storytelling. And I\u2019m glad. I think it has a lot to tell us about ourselves.\u201d It just probably wouldn\u2019t tell us in a film. \u201cTrue crime movies were definitely bigger in the past,\u201d says Murley. \u201cMedia changes. We change.\u201d\nYet the movies were there first. Consider the classics: Fritz Lang\u2019s trailblazing M sprang out of real child murders; Psycho saw Hitchcock repurpose the grim Ed Gein case. Beyond individual milestones, the very stuff of film storytelling \u2013 gangster movies, horror, thrillers, westerns \u2013 all grew out of true crime. It is less a sub-genre than the soul of cinema.\nThe big-screen genre became a sliding scale, from sober documentary to the starry and scandalous. House of Gucci is the latter, of course \u2013 a bloody soap.Of course Jared Leto is involved, and already a meme in his velvet suit at the London premiere. The red carpet hijinks feel old-fangled too. At the higher end, true crime now carries itself differently. Stories may still focus on the wealthy and notorious \u2013 but only with a certain gravity of purpose.\nTake The People v OJ Simpson, 2016\u2019s acclaimed longform dramatisation. Stylistically, it had everything a series gives and a movie cannot. The breathing space of its running time, the episodic structure, room for breadcrumb-trail detail \u2013 all this came with streaming and TV, which are perfect for true crime. But there was also a question of tone. After Serial, a bar had been set, whatever the medium. If a project was going to reopen a famous old wound such as, say, the killing of Nicole Brown Simpson, it would also have to widen the lens, humanise the victim, contextualise everything. The mere crime could not be the only story.\nFor podcasts, the whole point has been the quotidian. Terrible murders, everyday victims. The lesson of movies such as M or Psycho \u2013 that monsters are among us so FFS roll the window up \u2013 now comes instead from Park Predators and Wine & Crime. The gulf is only made more pronounced by the low-tech of it all, millions of dollars away from the aggressive gloss of a Ridley Scott movie.\nStill, plenty of true crime podcasts indulge in cinematic scene-setting. This American Life \u2013 the series from which Serial span-off \u2013 says it makes \u201cmovies for radio\u201d. But the filmic touches feel less like homage than a cannibalising for parts.\nEven a Hollywood crime story now becomes a podcast. Film-maker Vanessa Hope is the granddaughter of movie producer Walter Wanger and actor Joan Bennett, once a leading femme fatale. In 1951, suspecting an affair, Wanger shot his wife\u2019s agent, Jennings Lang, in a Beverly Hills parking lot. This year, Hope told the story in a 10-part podcast, Love Is a Crime, with Jon Hamm and Zooey Deschanel playing her grandparents. To Hope, it made perfect sense that the project was not a movie. \u201cHollywood has always made money from a gun and a girl. The gun is glorified and the girl \u2013 the woman \u2013 is silent.\u201d The very nature of film, she says, is wrong for the job. \u201cA two-hour movie always reduces the full arc of people\u2019s lives \u2013 and the person most reduced is the victim.\u201d\nA similar ripple of change has reached Britain. Last September, huge audiences watched Des, ITV\u2019s three-part drama about the 1983 arrest of Scottish serial killer Dennis Nilsen. Co-writer Luke Neal had been inspired by The People v OJ Simpson. \u201cYou start out thinking you\u2019re watching to find out how OJ got away with it. And the brilliance is, he ends up a minor character. What keeps you there is the human cost.\u201d\nIn Des, Neal created the same dynamic. \u201cWe watch these stories because we want to know who this person is who takes other people\u2019s lives. In fact, he doesn\u2019t matter. What does is the people whose lives he took. The problem with true crime is it wants to compete with fiction, so you end up with countless Ted Bundy movies. But real killers have no glamour. The truth isn\u2019t Jamie Dornan in a sexy game of cat and mouse.\u201d\nLongform true crime upped the ante elsewhere too. Another landmark was The Jinx, Andrew Jarecki\u2019s 2015 portrait of the US real estate heir and now convicted murderer Robert Durst. The finale featured a muttered confession, seemingly recorded by accident. How could a movie match that? (And who now remembers All Good Things, the Durst-inspired movie released by Jarecki five years earlier, starring a vague Ryan Gosling?)\nThe impulse to crack cases on air has been wired into the true crime podcast. That the results often end in a shrug is not a dealbreaker. Loose threads are simply picked up online. But for a Hollywood movie, uncertainty is death. The exception that proved the rule was David Fincher\u2019s doubt-shrouded Zodiac, a box-office hit that inspired not a single rip-off. (Fincher then took his serial killer habit to Netflix with the sleekly titillating series Mindhunter.)\nBut true crime as live investigation is not the only new remit. Genre fans have always skewed female. Podcasts have only intensified that, and the result is a landscape of work made by women for women about \u2013 and this can seem an odd dynamic \u2013 women being murdered. There is an explanation. Social psychologist Amanda Vicary is a true crime fan with a professional interest. \u201cMy research,\u201d she says, \u201cshows that women like true crime when it gives them information about techniques to escape a killer.\u201d If horror movies give our fear centres a harmless work-out, modern true crime has a bleakly practical purpose. \u201cWomen listen,\u201d Vicary adds, \u201cto find out what to do if they\u2019re thrown in the trunk of a car.\u201d\nOf course, House of Gucci centres on a woman too. The Black Widow trope is as old as it is statistically improbable and commercially alluring. If the story overlaps with Killer Women With Piers Morgan, it is not the first film to draw a prestige male director to a real story of a woman accused. This year\u2019s other major true crime-ish movie was Stillwater, with Tom McCarthy fictionalising the case of Amanda Knox, who was acquitted after four years in an Italian jail for murder. Knox herself went public with her distress.\nHouse of Gucci has also drawn criticism from family members on various grounds: 1) violation of privacy; 2) Al Pacino\u2019s rendering of patriarch Aldo Gucci (\u201cfat, short, ugly\u201d). But it would be a mistake to think the old hulk of movie true crime was the only problem. The whole genre still lives on ethical thin ice. The success may not be helping. This September, a giddy podcast-ish hubbub greeted the disappearance of American \u201cvanlifer\u201d Gabby Petito. It only grew louder when she was found to have been killed. Big True Crime was already at work. \u201cWhen you turn on Hulu,\u201d her mother, Nichole Schmidt, tweeted this month, \u201cand your daughter\u2019s story is the recommended show.\u201d\nEven lovers of the genre are also troubled by a fixation with one kind of victim. \u201cTrue crime has never reflected the reality of murder,\u201d Jean Murley says. \u201cIt\u2019s almost a fantasy genre. Who gets killed in America? Disproportionately, it is young men of colour. But the quintessential true crime victim is a young, pretty, white woman. It\u2019s very ritualised.\u201d Murley will consider this and other matters in an updated version of her book. There is a lot to say about true crime in the 21st century.\nDes writer Neal is optimistic \u2013 cautiously. \u201cI do think true crime is changing,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s good. It needs to. Because actually, life is not cheap.\u201d\n House of Gucci is released in UK cinemas on 26 November.",

It is expected to pass later this week with amendments.\nAghion had not been aware of the specifics of the debate in parliament when commenting about his broader concerns regarding Nazi imagery.\nOn Tuesday, Lovell, a member for Northern Victoria region, said that while she was not comparing members of the Andrews government to the Nazi regime: \u201cI do think that we should consider the legislation that enabled the events in Germany to occur.\n\u201cWe cannot go down this path, and we should not go down this path,\u201d she said. \u201cWe should never let a bad episode of history repeat itself.\n\u201cWe must learn from history, and we must also recognise that whilst the current government assure us that this is not how they intend to use these powers, and we accept that none of us know who may inherit these powers in the future or how a future government may use these powers.\u201d\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nLovell also described the pandemic bill as the worst law she had seen in her 19 years in parliament, and said a Herald Sun cartoon that depicted Andrews driving a tank towards a protester, evoking the Tiananmen Square massacre, encapsulated how the government dealt with people who disagreed with it.\nThe Victorian opposition leader, Matthew Guy, made clear on Wednesday that he opposed any depiction of the Victorian government as Nazis, though he did not specifically comment on Lovell\u2019s speech.\nBut Guy made clear he would not condemn any Liberal MPs who attended the protest, nor rebuke any of them for how they debated the pandemic laws, provided they did so respectfully and without invoking hysteria.\nGuy attended Zionism Victoria\u2019s annual assembly on Tuesday night, only hours after Lovell made her comments, and said it was made clear to him during the meeting that Nazi imagery should not be used in any way in political debate. The federal treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, has also condemned the depiction of Andrews as Hitler.\n \nEmail:\u00a0sign up for our\u00a0daily morning and afternoon email newsletters\nApp:\u00a0download our free app\u00a0and never miss the biggest stories\nSocial:\u00a0follow us on YouTube,\u00a0TikTok,\u00a0Instagram,\u00a0Facebook\u00a0or\u00a0Twitter\nPodcast:\u00a0listen to our daily episodes on\u00a0Apple Podcasts,\u00a0Spotify\u00a0or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app\nAghion, who is a commercial lawyer recently appointed to senior counsel, also said that comments made by Christopher Blanden QC, the outgoing Victorian Bar president, about the pandemic law were inappropriate.\nBlanden told the Age last month: \u201cStasi police would have been more than happy with the range of powers if they were given it.\u201d\nBlanden completed his term as president of the bar association, of which Aghion is a member, earlier this month. Aghion said Blanden\u2019s analogy was wrong.\n\u201cThere can be a debate about the merits of the legislation, but Victoria is not remotely a Nazi dictatorship.\u201d",

There is also the option to be paid partially in bitcoin and traditional dollars.\n\u201cWe are giving the players the freedom to decide what is best for their unique situation,\u201d Nelkovski said. \u201cThe entire process is very similar to the traditional payments process with one added variable which is how much of their salary they would like to keep in bitcoin.\u201d\nNelkovski said the deal did not need to be ratified by Baseball Australia, which has been supportive of the move. BA, the game\u2019s national governing body, was contacted for comment.\nA new position of chief bitcoin officer has been created by the club \u2013 filled by Patrick O\u2019Sullivan \u2013 to facilitate the new operation and the shift of \u201cthe corporate treasury\u201d from dollars to cryptocurrency.\n\u201cThis is not a one-off purchase to hedge against future uncertainties or inflationary pressures,\u201d said O\u2019Sullivan. \u201cThe Perth Heat are embracing the reality that the future of money and corporate treasuries will live on the bitcoin blockchain.\u201d\nIn a team statement, the Heat claimed it was the first professional sports club in the world to \u201cfully embrace bitcoin and the Lightning Network for payment acceptance and payroll for staff and players\u201d.\nSeveral American sports stars are known to have elected to exchange a portion or all of their salary to bitcoin, but those payments were initiated by the players themselves, rather than from the top down.\nThe Heat are one of Australian baseball\u2019s most successful clubs and have won four ABL championships since the formation of the league in 2010.\nNelkovski said he believed the sponsorship deal would enable the organisation to reach new levels of success both on and off the field.\n\u201cWe firmly believe that the mindset that bitcoin imparts on network participants will be felt by our players, coaches, staff, and our loyal fanbase,\u201d Nelkovski said.\nThe 2021-22 ABL season, which was initially scheduled to start on Thursday this week, was last month cancelled for the second straight year to due disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.",

I did not sign it,\u201d Joyce told the ABC on Monday.\nBut McCormack said on Wednesday any agreement the Australian government signed involved the National party, which governs in coalition with the Liberal party.\n\u201cI\u2019m not distancing myself from anything in that regard,\u201d the former Nationals leader told the ABC.\n\u201cThose questions have to be put to the current leader\u201d.\nAsked whether it had been inappropriate for Joyce to distance the Nationals from what was clearly a government decision, McCormack said: \u201cWe\u2019re in full agreement with the government and the government\u2019s position is the government\u2019s position we took to Glasgow\u201d.\nAhead of the Glasgow summit, Scott Morrison secured agreement from the Nationals to adopt a new emissions reduction target of net zero by 2050. The prime minister also sought agreement for an increase in the Abbott-era 2030 target, but that sortie was vetoed by Joyce.\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nThe Morrison government supported language in the final Glasgow communique pointing to a review of the 2030 target before the next United Nations-led climate summit in Egypt.\nBut in a statement issued in Australia shortly after Glasgow wrapped, ministers Marise Payne and Angus Taylor suggested the Coalition had no plans to ratchet up ambition. The statement said Australia\u2019s 2030 target was \u201cfixed\u201d.\nJoyce has made it clear this week the Nationals will not support any increase in the 2030 target.\nOn Tuesday, he said: \u201cThe Nationals have clearly stated that they aren\u2019t changing the 2030 target\u201d.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been honest and upfront about that \u2026 we\u2019ve told you the truth about what our position is.\u201d\nA number of Liberals had hoped Morrison would go to the looming election seeking a mandate from voters for a higher 2030 emissions reduction target, but the prime minister has ruled that out.\nSome Liberals are now urging Morrison to go to the election with a new emissions reduction target for 2035.\nMcCormack left that idea open on Wednesday. He said setting a 2035 target would be \u201ca matter for the cabinet going forward\u201d.\n\u201cWe\u2019re meeting and beating our 2030 targets,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s see as we get closer to 2030 as to how well we\u2019re doing\u201d.\n\u201cOf course, politics is ever evolving and we\u2019re making sure that we do the responsible thing by lowering emissions but at the same time protecting the economy\u201d.\nJoyce has also not directly answered questions about whether the Nationals would accept a higher emissions reduction target for 2035. He has given the impression Nationals would oppose an increase, but he has not been definitive.\nAsked earlier this week about the renewed 2035 push by Liberals, including Jason Falinski and Dave Sharma, Joyce said they were \u201cgreat people\u201d who represented an affluent metropolitan constituency.\nWhile avoiding a direct answer on 2035, Joyce contended the view of voters in Sydney was different to the \u201cview you get in Singleton or Muswellbrook\u201d. Joyce said Liberals and Nationals needed to represent their respective constituencies.",

If we can\u2019t, if they can\u2019t be in agreement, then obviously the famous article 16 is a very real option,\u201d he told BBC Good Morning Ulster.\nFrost also criticised the EU\u2019s threat to retaliate with sanctions that include tariffs or the termination of the UK\u2019s entire trade deal as unhelpful.\n\u201cI don\u2019t see why it would help \u2026 for the response to that from the European Union to be sanctions, retaliation and making trade more difficult,\u201d he said.\nHe repeatedly said article 16 was a \u201cperfectly legitimate option\u201d and rejected arguments that pulling the plug on the protocol would be a hammer blow to businesses that see the special arrangement for Northern Ireland as a unique \u201cbest of both worlds\u201d opportunity to access Great Britain as well as the EU\u2019s single market.\nBusiness leaders also met Frost on Tuesday and reported that it was \u201cthe most positive\u201d meeting they had had with him since the row over the protocol broke out.\nOne of the dozen who had dinner with him in Belfast said: \u201cWe felt we were being talked with, not at, for the first time. You could even say it was congenial. We all went in there thinking this is the precursor to pulling article 16 but he doubled down on wanting a deal.\u201d\nFears have risen in recent weeks that the UK\u2019s ultimate goal was to remove all checks on goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland to meet demands made by the DUP, which is campaigning for the protocol to be scrapped.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t see any need and I think it is one of the pieces of common ground in this whole negotiation that nobody wants to see infrastructure or checks at the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, and there\u2019s absolutely no need for that. And our proposals in the command paper don\u2019t require it,\u201d he told BBC Good Morning Ulster.\nFrost said the UK was not seeking to scrap the protocol altogether.\n\u201cThere will always have to be some sort of treaty arrangement between the UK and the EU covering Northern Ireland. But it\u2019s got to be an arrangement that everybody can get behind.\u201d\nAsked why should people in Northern Ireland should trust him to represent their interests when his position appeared to be biased towards one side of the community, he said: \u201cI think this government always will have the best interests of everybody in Northern Ireland.\u201d",

        "content": "The team have the lowest attendance in the NFL, and it\u2019s no surprise given the product on and off the field\nThe ageless Tom Brady was in town on Sunday, and it was a nice day to watch football even at a dull stadium stuck in the suburbs. The Washington Football Team were 9.5-point underdogs against Tampa Bay, but, still, only 52,128 of 82,000 tickets were sold for a game between Brady\u2019s Bucs and the WFT, the lowest paid NFL attendance over the weekend.\nBrady had a bad day, and the Football Team somehow put together a 19-play, 10\u00bd-minute touchdown drive to seal a shock 29-19 victory, but the lousy turnout was not a surprise. Washington are dead last in the NFL in average home attendance this season, selling an average of 51,291 tickets to their five home games. So Sunday was actually an improvement at the gate.\nThey have somehow managed to draw fewer fans than the winless Detroit Lions, who are averaging 52,016 per home game. Washington, fourth in average attendance in 2011 and 20th in 2019, are the only team in the NFL selling fewer than 80% of their tickets (Washington home games average 62.6% capacity, the next lowest rate in the league is the Lions\u2019 80.7%). To make matters worse, many of the fans who do buy tickets come to root for the other team.\nThere are lots of reasons as to why this is, only a few of which have to do with football. Washington are 3-6, tied for last with the New York Giants for last place in the NFC East, with virtually no chance to win a division title. The quarterback, Taylor Heinicke, replaced injured veteran, Ryan Fitzpatrick, who\u2019d been signed as a free agent to bide a year.\nEven the victory over Tampa Bay was smudged with the news that defensive end Chase Young, the NFL defensive rookie of the year last season, tore his right anterior cruciate ligament against the Bucs and will miss the rest of the season. \u201cYou have to rally the troops, basically,\u201d head coach Ron Rivera said at a news conference. \u201cThat\u2019s just the way it is.\u201d\nMaybe Rivera will be able to rally his troops, but resuscitating interest in the team is proving to be a bigger challenge. The Dallas Cowboys may still be the most hated team in the NFL, but Washington, beset by one controversy after another, have to be the hardest team in the NFL for their own fans to like. Many have tuned out.\nThe latest mess only happened in October, when the House Oversight and Reform Commission asked the NFL to provide information collected in an investigation into the WFT\u2019s toxic workplace culture. The NFL answered Congress\u2019s questions but did not submit documents requested. The NFL had fined the WFT $10m in July for \u201cbullying and intimidation.\u201d\nAlong with accepting the fine, the franchise said Dan Snyder, the owner of the team for more than two decades, would take a lesser role in the organization. His wife, Tanya, would take over running the franchise, but many fans were disappointed that Dan Snyder, a widely disliked character, had not been kicked out for good \u2013 so the franchise, established in 1932, could launch another restart.\n\u201cThe last really great season they had was in 1991,\u201d Andy Pollin, a longtime Washington sports-radio talk-show host, tells the Guardian. \u201cMostly since 1999 when Dan Snyder bought the team, they\u2019ve been a disaster. His mismanagement of the team has just been a head-scratcher.\u201d\nWashington are even entwined in other team\u2019s problems. Las Vegas coach Jon Gruden resigned last month after an investigation found that he had made racist, homophobic and misogynistic comments in emails, some to Bruce Allen, Washington\u2019s much-reviled former general manager. (Gruden has sued the NFL, claiming the league forced him out of his job.)\nThe Fox affiliate in Washington carried a story last week in which it quoted a former fan, Shaun Taylor, as saying, \u201cThis has been happening for a long time. So yeah, I\u2019m done. I just don\u2019t watch the games anymore.\u201d Fans are gravitating to the exciting Lamar Jackson and the Baltimore Ravens, a playoff contender who play only 32 miles up the road.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re new to the area, which team are you going to gravitate to?\u201d Pollin says.\nThe Football Team can\u2019t even get the easy stuff right. Last month the team announced there would be a ceremony during a home game to retire the No 21 jersey worn by Sean Taylor, the Washington defensive back who was murdered in November 2007 by home intruders. The announcement was made just days before the game against the Chiefs, and the lack of notice for the ceremony was blamed for another disappointing crowd \u2013 this time just 51,322.\n\u201cWe thought that saving the news for a game-week reveal was the best way to focus the message on Sean and his legacy,\u201d Jason Wright, the team president, wrote in a letter to fans. \u201cWe didn\u2019t realize that so many of you wanted to make a trip to FedEx Field to be present for this moment \u2013 a true lack of understanding of what you, the lifeblood of this franchise, needed to mourn our collective loss and celebrate Sean\u2019s legacy.\u201d\nBeing that this was Dan Snyder\u2019s team, Washington were ripped not just for appearing to have scheduled the Taylor event to distract from the off-field strife, but also for renaming a road for Taylor at the stadium \u2026 that was lined with Porta-Potties. On and on it goes. The team is in Year 2 of finding a nickname that will replace its old racist one.\n\u201cRiverboat Ron\u201d Rivera provided a touching storyline last season, his first with Washington, by leading the team to the NFC East title as he battled squamous cell carcinoma. The Football Team topped a woeful division by winning seven of 16 games, but Washington tested Tampa Bay in a playoff game, trailing by just five points late in the fourth quarter.\nPollin is a third-generation Washingtonian who grew up rooting for the team partly because they were the only pro franchise in town for years when he was a kid. The NHL\u2019s Washington Capitals, MLB\u2019s Nationals and WNBA\u2019s Mystics have each won championships in the last three years.\nPollin describes the abandonment of the football team as a \u201cslow drip.\u201d There are many long-time Dallas Cowboys fans among Black DC residents because Washington were the last NFL team to integrate, in 1962. Later came the Snyder era, which only seems to have gotten worse. \u201cNow, a 10-win season would be cause for a parade,\u201d he says.\nAs a result, he says of the chaos, \u201cThe shock factor is just not there with anything that happens with this team.\u201d",

Berry makes it look good; she faces off with the real deal and she herself looks like a perfectly plausible deal.

Then her own mother (Adriane Lenox), insists that Jackie starts looking after Manny (Danny Boyd Jr), her young son from a previous relationship. Moreover, a big-time MMA manager (Shamier Anderson) contacts Jackie, looking to set her up in a new fight for cynical reasons of his own. All these things combine to inspire in Jackie a new purpose, and she approaches a trainer, Bobbi (Sheila Atim) who works with grizzled veteran Pops (Stephen McKinley Henderson) \u2013 they of course see in Jackie a glimmer of the right stuff, and the only way is up.\nAll the constituent scenes in this film, scripted by newcomer Michelle Rosenfarb, are very broad, Bobbi\u2019s character is a little underwritten and the ending itself is broadly predictable, but Berry brings commitment and focus to the drama.

According to the tech startup Voyager Labs, that information could help police figure out if you have committed or plan to commit a crime.\nVoyager Labs is one of dozens of US companies that have popped up in recent years with technology that purports to harness social media to help solve and predict crime.\nPulling information from every part of an individual\u2019s various social media profiles, Voyager helps police investigate and surveil people by reconstructing their entire digital lives \u2013 public and private. By relying on artificial intelligence, the company claims, its software can decipher the meaning and significance of online human behavior, and can determine whether subjects have already committed a crime, may commit a crime or adhere to certain ideologies.\nBut new documents, obtained through public information requests by the Brennan Center, a non-profit organization, and shared with the Guardian, show that the assumptions the software relies on to draw those conclusions may run afoul of first amendment protections. In one case, Voyager indicated that it considered using an Instagram name that showed Arab pride or tweeting about Islam to be signs of a potential inclination toward extremism.\nThe documents also reveal Voyager promotes a variety of ethically questionable strategies to access user information, including enabling police to use fake personas to gain access to groups or private social media profiles.\nVoyager, a nine-year-old startup registered as Bionic 8 Analytics with offices in Israel, Washington, New York and elsewhere, is a small fish in a big pond that includes companies like Palantir and Media Sonar. The Los Angeles police department trialed Voyager software in 2019, the Brennan Center documents show, and engaged in a lengthy back-and-forth with the company about a permanent contract. \nBut experts say Voyager\u2019s products are emblematic of a broader ecosystem of tech players answering law enforcement\u2019s calls for advanced tools to expand their policing capabilities.\nFor police, the appeal of such tools is clear: use technology to automatically and quickly see connections that might take officers much longer to uncover, or to detect unnoticed behaviors or leads that a human might not pick up on because of lack of sophistication or capacity. With immense pressure on departments to keep crime rates low and prevent attacks, using technology to be able to make fast and efficient law enforcement decisions is an attractive value proposition. New and existing documents show the LAPD alone has worked or considered working with companies such as PredPol, MediaSonar, Geofeedia, Dataminr, and now Voyager.\nBut for the public, social media-informed policing can be a privacy nightmare that effectively criminalizes casual and at times protected behavior, experts who have reviewed the documents for the Guardian say.\nAs the Guardian previously reported, police departments are often unwilling to relinquish the use of those tools even in the face of public outcry and in spite of little proof it helps to reduce crime.\nExperts also point out that companies like Voyager often use buzzwords such as \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d and \u201calgorithms\u201d to explain how they analyze and process information but provide little evidence that it works.\nA Voyager spokesperson, Lital Carter Rosenne, said the company\u2019s software was used by a wide range of clients to enable searches through databases but said that Voyager did not build those databases on its own or supply Voyager staffers to run its software.\n\u201cThese are our clients\u2019 responsibilities and decisions, in which Voyager has no involvement at all,\u201d Rosenne said in an email. \u201cAs a company, we follow the laws of all the countries in which we do business. We also have confidence that those with whom we do business are law-abiding public and private organizations.\u201d\n\u201cVoyager is a software company,\u201d Rosenne said in answer to questions about how the technology works. \u201cOur products are search and analytics engines that employ artificial intelligence and machine learning with explainability.\u201d\nVoyager did not respond to the detailed questions about who it has contracts with or how its software draws conclusions on a person\u2019s support for specific ideologies.\nLAPD declined to respond to a request for comment.\nThe way Voyager and companies like it work is not complicated, the documents show. Voyager software hoovers up all the public information available on a person or topic \u2013 including posts, connections and even emojis \u2013 analyzes and indexes it and then, in some cases, cross-references it with non-public information.\nInternal documents show the technology creates a topography of a person\u2019s entire social media existence, specifically looking at users\u2019 posts as well as their connections, and how strong each of those relationships are.\nThe software visualizes how a person\u2019s direct connections are connected to each other, where all of those connections work, and any \u201cindirect connections\u201d (people with at least four mutual friends). Voyager also detects any indirect connections between a subject and other people the customer has previously searched for.\nVoyager\u2019s data collection is far reaching. If a person tracked by Voyager software deletes a friend or a post from their own profile, it remains archived in their Voyager profile. The system catalogues not only a subject\u2019s contacts, but also any content or media those contacts posted, including status updates, pictures and geotags. And it draws in second- and third-degree friendships to \u201cunearth previously unknown middlemen or instances of improper association\u201d.\nMeredith Broussard, a New York University data journalism professor and author of Artificial Unintelligence: How Computers Misunderstand the World, said it appeared Voyager\u2019s algorithms were making assessments about people based on their online activity and networks, using a process that resembled online ad targeting.\nAd targeting systems place people in \u201caffinity groups\u201d, determining who is most likely to be interested in buying a new car, for example, based on their friends and connections, Broussard explained: \u201cSo instead of grouping people into buckets like \u2018pet owners\u2019, what Voyager seems to be doing is putting people into \u2018buckets\u2019 of likely criminals.\u201d\nIn the advertising context, many consumers have come to accept this kind of targeting, she said, but the stakes are much higher when it comes to policing.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a \u2018guilt by association\u2019 system,\u201d she said, adding that this kind of algorithm was not particularly sophisticated.\nVoyager software applies a similar process to Facebook groups, pages and events \u2013 both public and closed \u2013 cataloging recently published content and mapping out the most active users. Documents show the company also allows users to search for posts about specific topics, pulling up all mentions of that term, as well as the location tagged in those posts.\nThe company claims all of this information on individuals, groups and pages allows its software to conduct real-time \u201csentiment analysis\u201d and find new leads when investigating \u201cideological solidarity\u201d. In proposals to the LAPD, the company claimed its artificial intelligence platform was unmatched in its ability to analyze \u201chuman behavior indicators\u201d.\nVoyager claims its AI can provide insights such as an individual or group\u2019s \u201csocial whereabouts\u201d, can uncover hidden relationships and can perform a \u201csentiment analysis\u201d to determine where someone stands ideologically on various topics, including extremism.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t just connect existing dots,\u201d a Voyager promotional document read. \u201cWe create new dots. What seem like random and inconsequential interactions, behaviors or interests, suddenly become clear and comprehensible.\u201d\nA service the company calls VoyagerDiscover presents social profiles of people who \u201cmost fully identify with a stance or any given topic\u201d. The company says the system takes into account personal involvement, emotional involvement, knowledge and calls to action, according to documents. Unlike other companies, Voyager claims it doesn\u2019t need extra time to study and process online behavior and instead can make this type of judgment \u201con the fly\u201d.\n\u201cThis ability moves the discussion from those who are most engaged online to those most engaged in their hearts,\u201d the documents read.\nIn one redacted case study Voyager presented to LAPD when it was pursuing a contract with the agency, the company examined the ways in which it would have analyzed the social media profile of Adam Alsahli, who was killed last year while attempting to attack the Corpus Christi naval base in Texas.\nThe company wrote that its software used artificial intelligence to examine whether subjects have ties to Islamic fundamentalism, and color coded these profiles as green, orange or red (orange and red seemingly indicating a proclivity toward extremism). \u201cThis provides a flag or indication for further vetting or investigation, before an incident has occurred, as part of an effort to put in place a \u2018trip wire\u2019 to indicate emerging threats,\u201d the company wrote.\nIn Alsahli\u2019s case, Voyager said, the company concluded his social media activity reflected \u201cIslamic fundamentalism and extremism\u201d and suggested investigators could further reviews Alsahli\u2019s accounts to \u201cdetermine the strength and nature of his direct and indirect connections to other Persons of Interest\u201d.\nBut the documents show that many aspects of what Voyager pointed out as tripwires or signals of fundamentalism could also qualify as free speech or other protected activity. Voyager, for instance, said 29 of Alsahli\u2019s 31 Facebook posts were pictures with Islamic themes and that one of Alsahli\u2019s Instagram account handles, which was redacted in the documents, reflected \u201chis pride in and identification with his Arab heritage\u201d.\nWhen examining the list of accounts he followed and who followed him, Voyager said that \u201cmost are in Arabic\u201d \u2013 one of the 100 languages the company said it can automatically translate \u2013 and \u201cgenerally appear\u201d to be accounts posting religious content. On his Twitter account, Voyager wrote, Alsahli mostly tweeted about Islam.\nThe documents also implicated Alsahli\u2019s connections, writing that three Facebook users he shared posts with could \u201chave had other interactions with him outside social media, or been connecting in the same Islamist circles and forums\u201d.\nParts of the documents were redacted. However, the only visible mention of content that could be seen as explicitly tying Alsahli to fundamentalism consisted of tweets Voyager said he had posted in support of mujahideen.\nJulie Mao, the deputy director of Just Futures, a legal support group for immigrants, said she worried the color-coded risk algorithm and Voyager\u2019s choice to study this particular case showed potential bias.\n\u201cIt\u2019s always easy in hindsight to pick out someone who was violent and say \u2018hey, tech works based on them,\u2019\u201d Mao said. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly opaque how Voyager arrived to this threat level (was it something more than expressing religious devotion?) and how many individuals receive similar threat levels based on innocuous conduct. So even by its own logic, it\u2019s a flawed example of accuracy and could lead to over-policing and harassment.\u201d\nIt\u2019s \u201cbasically a stop and frisk tool for police\u201d, Mao said.\nVoyager\u2019s claims that it used \u201ccutting-edge AI-based technologies\u201d such as \u201cmachine learning\u201d, \u201ccognitive computing\u201d, and \u201ccombinatorial and statistical algorithms\u201d were, in effect, just \u201cword salad\u201d, said Cathy O\u2019Neil, a data scientist and CEO of Orcaa, a firm that audits algorithms. \u201cThey\u2019re saying, \u2018We use big math.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t actually say anything about what they\u2019re doing.\u201d\nIn fact, O\u2019Neil said, companies like Voyager generally provided little evidence demonstrating their algorithms had the capabilities they claim. And often, she said, police departments did not require or ask for this kind of data, and companies would be unable to provide evidence if it were requested \u2013 because their claims are frequently hyperbolic and unfounded.\nThe problem with this kind of marketing, O\u2019Neil added, was that it could provide cover for biased policing practices: \u201cIf they successfully get people to trust their algorithm, with zero evidence that it works, then it can be weaponized.\u201d\nMelina Abdullah, a Black Lives Matter LA co-founder, said she was disturbed to learn about the conclusions Voyager\u2019s software had made about the online activity of Muslim users.\n\u201cAs a Black Muslim, I\u2019m concerned. I always know that my last name alone flags me differently than other folks, that I\u2019m seen with heightened scrutiny, that there are assumptions made about \u2018extremism\u2019 because I\u2019m Muslim,\u201d she said, adding that the records left her with many unanswered questions: \u201cWho have they been flagging and what are the justifications? \u2026 It sounds like everybody\u2019s vulnerable to this.\u201d\nRelying on publicly available information, Voyager\u2019s software cobbles together a fairly comprehensive and invasive picture of a person\u2019s private life, the experts said. But the company supplements that data with non-public information it gains access to through two primary channels: warrants or subpoenas and what the company calls an \u201cactive persona\u201d.\nIn the first case, Voyager tech sifts through vast swaths of data law enforcement gets through various types of warrants. Such information can include subjects\u2019 private messages, their location information or the keywords they have searched for. Voyager catalogs and analyzes these often vast troves of user data \u2013 an undertaking LAPD officers wrote in emails they would appreciate help with \u2013 and cross-references it with social and geographic maps drawn up from public information.\nFor its Facebook-specific warrant service, Voyager software analyzes private messages to identify profiles subjects are communicating most frequently with. It then shows a subject\u2019s public posts alongside these private messages to provide \u201cvaluable\u201d context. \u201cIn numerous cases, its effectiveness has prompted our clients to request additional PDF warrant returns\u201d from tech companies, the documents read. Voyager said it planned to roll out the same warrant-indexing capabilities for Instagram and Snap, which would include image processing capabilities.\nJohn Hamasaki, a criminal defense lawyer and member of San Francisco\u2019s police commission, said he had already had concerns about how judges grant law enforcement access to people\u2019s private online accounts, especially Black and Latino defendants accused of being in gangs: \u201cThe degree to which private information is being seized, purportedly lawfully under search warrants, is just way over-broad.\u201d\nIf police were additionally using software and algorithms to analyze the private data, it compounded the potential privacy and civil liberties violations, he said: \u201cAnd what conclusions are they drawing from it, and what spin is an expert giving to it? Because \u2018gang experts\u2019 are notorious for coming to a conclusion that supports the prosecution.\u201d\nThere is less detail about the second means through which Voyager software accesses non-public information: its premium service called \u201cactive persona\u201d. The documents indicate customers can use what Voyager calls \u201cavatars\u201d to \u201ccollect and analyze information that is otherwise inaccessible\u201d on select networks. Using the active persona feature, the company said, its software was able to access and analyze information from encrypted messaging app Telegram. A 2019 product roadmap also shows plans to roll out the \u201cactive persona\u201d mechanism for WhatsApp groups, \u201cmeaning the user will have to provide the system with an avatar with access to the group from which he wishes to collect\u201d. A timeline Voyager provided to the LAPD shows the company also had plans to introduce a feature that enabled \u201cInstagram private profile collection\u201d.\nExperts say the \u201cactive persona\u201d feature appears to be another name for fake profiles and an LAPD officer described the function in an email with Voyager as the ability to \u201clog in with fake accounts that are already friended with the target subject and pulling data\u201d. While police departments across the country have increasingly used fake social media profiles to conduct investigations, the practice may violate Facebook and other platforms\u2019 community standards.\nFacebook rules require people to use \u201cthe name they go by in everyday life\u201d. The company removes or temporarily restricts accounts that \u201ccompromise the security of other accounts\u201d or try to impersonate others. In 2018 police in Memphis, Tennessee, used a fake account under the name Bob Smith to befriend and gather information on activists. In response, Facebook deactivated the account and others like it and told the police department it needed to \u201ccease all activities on Facebook that involve the use of fake accounts or impersonation of others.\u201d Facebook said everyone, including law enforcement, was required to use their real names on their profiles.\n\u201cAs stated in our terms of services, misrepresentations and impersonations are not allowed on our services and we take action when we find violating activity, \u201d a Facebook spokesperson, Sally Aldous, said in a statement.\nThe feature also posed privacy and ethical questions, experts said. \u201cI worry about how low the threshold is for tech companies explicitly enabling police surveillance,\u201d said Chris Gilliard, a professor at Macomb Community College and a research fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School\u2019s Shorenstein Center.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a long history of law enforcement spying on activists \u2013 who are engaging in entirely legal activities \u2013 in efforts to intimidate people or disrupt movements. Because of this, the bar for when companies aid police surveillance should be really high.\u201d",

        "content": "While the T20 World Cup was on, Cop 26 took the global centre stage in Glasgow. We look at how Super 12 nations are affected\nThe men\u2019s T20 World Cup and Cop26 drew to a close at about the same time. Australia flew home victorious after an eight-wicket thrashing of New Zealand in the final in Dubai, a tournament nicely summed up by our man in the desert Simon Burnton; delegates left Glasgow less triumphant. Here we assess how those Super 12 countries are coping in the climate emergency.\nAfghanistan The average Afghan produces only 0.2 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year, but the country is on the forefront of the climate crisis. Temperatures are rising twice as fast as the global average, and with horrible inevitability the population is hit by extreme weather event after extreme weather event \u2013 droughts, especially in northern Afghanistan, floods, and avalanches. Springs are becoming drier, autumns wetter. Crop loss caused by drought means that the country is missing 40% of the wheat it needs this year and the United Nations reported that 22m Afghans will suffer from \u201cacute food insecurity\u201d this winter. The Taliban takeover has meant a loss of international aid. Afghanistan had no official seat at Cop26.\nAustralia Under the current government, Australia is seen as a climate dissident, the biggest exporter of fossil gas in the world and the second biggest of thermal coal, with a foot on the brake of the march to net zero. And yet, due to its geography, it is vulnerable to increasing temperatures, day and night. In 2019 there were 43 \u201cextremely warm days,\u201d triple the number before 2000, this in term increases the length of the bush fire season. The horrendous fires of 2019-20 affected cricket with youth and Big Bash matches postponed, and players complaining of toxic air over the SCG. Rising sea temperatures are threatening the Great Barrier Reef while reduced rainfall threatens crops and river flow.\nBangladesh Densely populated and low-lying, Bangladesh was ranked the seventh most climate-vulnerable country between 2000 and 2019 by the Global Climate Risk Index. Nearly 170m people live on the delta of two of the world\u2019s biggest rivers, the Ganges and Brahmaputra. Rising sea levels increase salinisation, polluting local wells and reducing supplies of drinking water, as well as damaging crops and soil. It is estimated that by 2050 one in seven Bangladeshis will have been displaced because of rising sea levels.\nEngland and Scotland The UK has become 0.9 degrees warmer and six per cent wetter over the last 30 years. All of the top 10 hottest years have been since 2002 and infrastructure struggles once the temperature rises, with roads melting, rail lines buckling \u2013 twice, in recent years, Lord\u2019s has allowed members to remove their jackets because of the heat. Increased flooding has cost cricket dearly both in terms of finance \u2013 the storms of December 2015 caused more than \u00a33.5m worth of damage across 57 cricket clubs \u2013 and in terms of games postponed and cancelled, both in the recreational and professional game.\nIndia Cricket\u2019s big beast is on the frontline of the climate crisis, hit by erratic monsoons \u2013 with less rain but at a higher intensity \u2013 flooding, landslides and heatwaves. This summer, the Lancet Planetary Health journal estimated that there are 740,000 excess deaths a year in India due to extreme temperatures related to climate change. Nor is cricket immune: pollution stopped play in the 2017 Delhi Test between India and Sri Lanka when players were sick on the pitch and IPL matches have been switched because of lack of water.\nNamibia An extremely climate-vulnerable country, one of the driest south of the Sahara desert. Rainfall is increasingly unpredictable, with knock-on effects for agriculture and livestock particularly for the poorest people. Higher temperatures and extreme heat are expected to increase evaporation and therefore aridity, as well as the incidence of disease, while rising sea levels will affect numbers of fish. Even if temperature increases globally were able to be kept to 1.5 degrees over the pre-industrial baseline, Namibia\u2019s temperature is projected to increase by two degrees.\nNew Zealand The majority of New Zealanders live on the coast and many on flood plains. Rising sea levels and increases in extreme rainfall will increase the risk of flooding and the potential for salt water to enter the freshwater systems. Of New Zealand\u2019s 50,000 species, half are found nowhere else in the world and changing climate conditions puts them increasingly at risk, with 70 native plants likely to be at risk of extinction by 2100. Changing ocean chemistry is already affecting marine life.\nPakistan Ranked the eighth most climate-vulnerable country between 2000 and 2019, Pakistan is threatened in all directions: from extreme heat, from the melting of the Himalayan glaciers, from more intense monsoons \u2013 nine inches of rain fell in a day in Karachi last August. Deforestation \u2013 from 33% of the country in 1947 to 4% today \u2013 mostly driven by illegal logging, has left a country with little protection against flooding and storms.\nSouth Africa The Cape Town drought of 2015-18 saw the temporary cancellation of club and school cricket as the population\u2019s water was rationed and the country counted down to Day Zero. A year later the dams were 80% full, but the threat of water shortage hangs heavy over a country where temperatures are increasing and rainfall is decreasing.\nSri Lanka Nearly half of Sri Lanka\u2019s population live in low-lying costal areas, making them extremely vulnerable to sea-level rise. The rise in the number of days of extreme heat threatens particularly the poor, and those labourers working without protection from the sun. Increasing temperatures are likely to affect rice yields and add to food insecurity.\nWest Indies The prime minister of Barbados, Mia Motley QC, has been lauded for the most powerful speech at Cop26. \u201cThe pandemic has shown us that national solutions to global problems do not work,\u201d she told the delegates. \u201cWhat must we say to our people living on the front line in the Caribbean, in Africa, in Latin America, in the Pacific, when both ambition and regrettably some of the needed faces are not present? What excuse should we give for failure? In the words of that Caribbean icon Eddy Grant, will they mourn us on the front line?\u201d\n This is an extract from the Guardian\u2019s weekly cricket email, The Spin.

But then the 73 year old lifts her chin just enough as if to say, I\u2019m still here. And she sings Over the Rainbow in a growl to rival Tom Waits.\nA decade ago there was a stage show inspired by a film, Yo Soy As\u00ed, about the closing of a drag cabaret in Barcelona, and the ageing performers there. That show was Gardenia, created by directors Frank Van Laecke and Alain Platel of Belgian dance-theatre collective Les Ballets C de la B, with a group of its own ageing gay and trans performers. Now Gardenia returns with eight of the original cast (the ninth, Andrea De Laet, died in 2016).\nThese performers must have some stories to tell, but this is not that show. Gardenia is a much more impressionistic view of that final night backstage, wigs on the dressing table, a rail of sparkly dresses. At the opening, they wear suits \u2013 a different kind of drag. There\u2019s a dissonance between the arrival of Rudy Suwyns, looking like a disgruntled chair of the Rotary Club, and being told \u201cshe\u2019s the queen of blowjobs!\u201d We see constant dressing and undressing, identities in flux, floral dresses nestling under men\u2019s jackets (and a fabulous Liza Minnelli look).\nThe performers and performance are slow-moving. The mood is sparse, fragments of voices in the air like theatre ghosts. It feels frail, in a way \u2013 what\u2019s holding it together is unclear \u2013 but there is time just to witness these bodies, these humans, if you can get into its zone. Then the light joviality suddenly evaporates to leave pain and fear, a whiff of the characters\u2019 inner struggles.\nThere are some moments of real theatrical grace: a lip sync to Caetano Veloso\u2019s Cucurrucuc\u00fa Paloma (as seen in Almod\u00f3var\u2019s Talk to Her); Ravel\u2019s Bolero underlining a slow crescendo of dressing up; the final moving number not so much a big finish as an inevitable slipping away. This, incidentally, is to be 64-year-old director Platel\u2019s final show. It\u2019s a piece about fragility and endurance, and how even the brightest lights must fade.\nAt Sadler\u2019s Wells, London on 17 November",

        "content": "Dominant at home with Al Sadd, the new Barcelona coach also improved players but fell short in the Asian Champions League\nXavi Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s time as head coach of Al Sadd in Qatar can be described as utter dominance and entertainment at home coupled with disappointment abroad. At the moment, Barcelona would probably take that. This has been a marriage arranged for some time, with the Spanish club waiting for their former player, who is on record as saying that he was looking for experience before making the big move back home. On Saturday he will be in charge of the club for the first time.\nWhether 30 months in Doha is adequate preparation for Barcelona is debatable given the differences: the leagues, the clubs, the countries, the owners, the fans, the media, the pressure \u2013 pretty much everything. Even in the middle of a genuine title race, Qatar offers a relatively laidback football environment. Coaches can come and go quickly but this owes more to the whims of owners rather than any overwhelming groundswell of discontent from media or fans.\nIn Xavi\u2019s case, media and fans have been largely happy with his presence as a player from 2015, when he helped lift Al Sadd\u2019s attendances towards five figures at times, and then, from May 2019, as coach. Since then the 41-year-old has won everything there is to win in Qatar but then that is expected at a club with close to 60 trophies in the cabinet. There were a number of cups lifted (the plethora of knockout competitions is partly down to a short 22-game season) and the 2020-21 league won by 13 points.\nThe football was good, especially after the first year or so, with a commitment to playing out from the back and attacking at every opportunity \u2013 last season\u2019s goal difference of +63 is testament to that. This season has been just as impressive. The first eight games were won and their 3-3 draw with their biggest rivals Al Duhail at the beginning of November, watched by representatives from Barcelona, marked the first points dropped. It also took the unbeaten league run to 36 games, stretching back to March 2020.\nIt is impressive but then Al Sadd have most of the stars in the Qatar Stars League. A fair amount of the Qatar team that won the Asian Cup in 2019 is there, stalwarts such as that year\u2019s Asian Player of the Year, Akram Afif, Hassan al-Haydos, R\u00f3-R\u00f3, Abdelkarim Hassan and Tarek Salman. Encouragingly for Barcelona, these players have noticeably improved under Xavi.\nThe imports made a difference. The long-serving South Korea internationals Nam Tae-hee (now at Al Duhail) and Jung Woo-young are underrated, though Baghdad Bounedjah, who has averaged more than a goal a game since arriving in 2015, obviously is not. The Algerian striker is the focal point of the attack but there are goals from elsewhere such as Andr\u00e9 Ayew, who arrived from Swansea in July. The crucial signings came in the summer of 2020 however and took Al Sadd to the next level. Even with the goals of Bounedjah, Santi Cazorla has been the best attacker in the country and the Brazilian defensive midfielder Guilherme the linchpin, holding it all together.\nWhereas the domestic record has been perfect, his record overseas is not so stellar. Xavi has made little impact on the AFC Champions League, a tournament that Al Sadd won in 2011 with a team nowhere near as strong.\nIn September 2020 Al Sadd reached the second round but were defeated 1-0 by Persepolis (if Xavi really wanted to prepare for the Camp Nou then taking over this Iranian club with big crowds, bigger media pressure and plenty of politics and skulduggery behind the scenes would have been perfect). The well-organised Tehran team, despite a budget many times smaller, gave Al Sadd little time or space, sat back when needed and were deserved winners. Al Sadd were poor and this led to the first serious criticisms of the coach. With Cazorla and Guilherme just getting settled, however, there was confidence that the 2021 tournament would be more fruitful.\nIt was worse. Only three of the six games were won, two against Al Wehdat, the Jordanian team making their Champions League debut, and the other against Foolad of Iran. Al Sadd needed a draw against Saudi Arabia\u2019s Al Nassr in the final game to progress but lost to the Riyadh club for the second time in the group stage. Al Nassr are no minnows, with plenty of cash, but despite rumours of problems inside the dressing room and mixed performances at home, they were too good, or just too clever, leaving Xavi complaining about referees and playing surfaces \u2013 a classic combination used by coaches throughout the ages.\nAsian fortunes could well have been different at the third time of asking but we will never know because now it is all about Europe. Whatever happens, Xavi will be missed in Qatar but if he brings Pep Guardiola levels of success back to Barcelona then Al Sadd will be happy to have been the start of that journey.",

What I\u2019ve been able to do and hopefully what we\u2019ll all be able to do moving forward will be more powerful than any runs and wickets or Ashes and World Cups.\u201d\nRafiq also revealed he had received death threats since claiming that \u201cinstitutional racism\u201d at Yorkshire left him close to taking his own life. \u201cWe\u2019ve had threats throughout, different types, but it comes with the territory,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a lot of people in denial and it\u2019s sad but hopefully we can get through it.\u201d\nHe also believes \u201chundreds and thousands\u201d of cricketers could follow his lead by sharing experiences of racism in the game and warned Yorkshire cannot move forward until Andrew Gale and Martyn Moxon have left the club.\nHe told Sky Sports News: \u201cI think you\u2019re going to get it into the hundreds and thousands, possibly. I do feel it\u2019s going to be a little bit of \u2018floodgates\u2019 and a lot of victims of abuse are going to come forward.\u201d\nRafiq, who battled tears on several occasions during Tuesday\u2019s testimony as he outlined how he fought depression and thoughts of suicide, said he felt an element of \u201cclosure\u201d after his appearance, but the same may not be true for those he has accused. He now wants more departures at Yorkshire, following that of former chair Roger Hutton, whose showing at the DCMS committee was described by Rafiq as \u201cvery weak\u201d, and chief executive Mark Arthur.\nRafiq specifically believes Gale, who is currently suspended as head coach pending investigation over a historic tweet, and director of cricket Moxon, who is signed off work with a stress-related illness, are in untenable positions. Both featured heavily in his allegations, with Gale accused of constant racial abuse and Moxon of systematic bullying, including on Rafiq\u2019s first day back after the stillbirth of his son.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Martyn and Andrew can [continue],\u201d said Rafiq. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible for Yorkshire to move forward with them in there, with them knowing full well what role they played in that institution.\u201d\nNeither man took up the chance to give their own evidence in Westminster, with Rafiq concluding: \u201cThey had an opportunity yesterday to come down here under parliamentary privilege to get their side of the story across and they didn\u2019t.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Sayeeda Warsi, the first British Muslim cabinet minister and now serving in the House of Lords, has called on the England and Wales Cricket Board to lead a period of change. Apparently unimpressed by the select committee appearance of an ECB delegation, led by the chief executive Tom Harrison, she told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cWhat was disappointing for me yesterday was the way in which the ECB felt they could step aside in the past because the clubs accused of racism wanted to mark their own homework.\n\u201cSo it is time for the ECB to be involved with a full inquiry which includes a truth and reconciliation process that allows anonymity because that is what players want. What happened to Azeem was the tip of the iceberg in Yorkshire and what we are seeing happening in Yorkshire is the tip of the iceberg as to what is happening in English cricket. I have spoken, as has Azeem and others, to many young and talented players \u2013 players who have now given up cricket because of what they have faced in other counties and clubs up and down the country and this is an endemic issue.\u201d\n'I was told that no matter what you do, you will not play first team no matter how well you do.'Former Essex cricketer Zoheb Sharif was let go in 2004. Despite his good performance, Zoheb believes the reason for his release was down to his race. pic.twitter.com/jYUlQaJZFT\nThe former Essex player Zoheb Sharif revisited his own recent allegations of racism at Essex, calling on the club, and others, to act decisively. He told Good Morning Britain: \u201cIt is really sad that it still goes on and hopefully now with Azeem talking, and a few others talking, we can put an end to this once and for all. I don\u2019t think Essex have formally launched an investigation yet. I spoke a little bit to the chairman at Essex. I hope they are [taking it seriously], especially with Azeem\u2019s case. It is not just me, there are others at Essex who have come out, too.\u201d\nEssex\u2019s chief executive, John Stephenson, has acknowledged Sharif\u2019s claims, declaring himself \u201cshocked and saddened\u201d and outlining a \u201czero tolerance policy towards racism\u201d at the club.",

He made this view clear to Mr Chishti yesterday.\u201d\nChishti, 50, is accused of beating Spottiswoode while having sex with her on a work trip to Brazil in 2017. She also told the US House of Representatives\u2019s judiciary committee that Chishti had told her \u201che should have had sex with me when I was 13 years old\u201d.\nThe committee released images on Wednesday allegedly showing neck injuries sustained by Spottiswoode.\nAfiniti, which also employs Princess Beatrice, said Chishti \u201cstrongly disputes all accusations against him\u201d and said her claims were \u201cerroneous\u201d.\n\u201cWe take any allegations of this nature extremely seriously,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cAfiniti has investigated Ms Spottiswoode\u2019s claims with independent counsel and concluded that the arbitral decision she references was erroneous. Afiniti\u2019s CEO and chair Zia Chishti strongly disputes all accusations against him.\u201d\nCameron joined Afiniti, which provides call centre technology to companies including Virgin Media and Sky, in 2019 as chair of its advisory board, providing strategic guidance to the company\u2019s management and board members. At the time of his appointment, he said he would help \u201ctransform the future of customer service and interpersonal communications\u201d.\nSpottiswoode, who joined the company in 2016, told the committee her contract included an arbitration agreement with a \u201cstrong confidentiality clause\u201d that had prevented her from speaking out about the alleged assaults.\nShe was giving testimony to a hearing into how forced arbitration clauses have been used to prevent survivors of sexual harassment and sexual violence from pursuing cases through the courts.\nJerry Nadler, the chair of the judiciary committee, is preparing legislation that would ban the use of forced arbitration in cases of alleged sexual violence and harassment.\nSpottiswoode, a Columbia University law student and friend of Chishti\u2019s daughter, told members of Congress that Chishti pressured her into having sex in order to keep her job.\nShe accused him of \u201cnot [being] willing to treat me like an employee\u201d. She added: \u201cInstead, over the next 18 months he oscillated between pressuring me for sex and punishing me. When I rebuffed him he humiliated me in front of co-workers and then ignored me completely, causing me to fear for my job.\u201d\nShe said on the work trip to Brazil she \u201cbegan to worry that, in addition to wanting sex, Chishti wanted to hurt me and punish me for rejecting him\u201d.\n\u201cI felt completely trapped and hopeless. I was 23 and very far from home,\u201d she told the committee. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to lose my job, I didn\u2019t want him to get any angrier, I did not feel that anyone would protect me and I was too tired to argue with him any more. I went to his room where he beat me while having sex with me.\n\u201cI told him he was hurting me, he said: \u2018Good\u2019. He told me he should have had sex with me when we first met, when I was 13 years old.\u201d\nSpottiswoode said her body was \u201ccovered with scratches, cuts and contusions\u201d. \u201cI had bruises around my neck that looked like I had been strangled, a large bump on my head, and a black eye. A nurse at the hospital said I had the symptoms of a concussion.\u201d\nCameron\u2019s career since leaving Downing Street in 2016 has been tarnished by his role lobbying on behalf of collapsed bank Greensill. He was told by MPs on the Treasury select committee that his persistent lobbying to have Greensill included in a government-backed Covid-19 loans scheme had \u201cdemeaned\u201d the position of the prime minister and left his \u201creputation in tatters\u201d.\nThe former PM was forced to deny that his text message and WhatsApp lobbying campaign on behalf of Greensill was driven by fears that an \u201copportunity to make a large amount of money was at risk\u201d.",

        "content": "Labour leader criticises prime minister in Commons for refusing to apologise over lobbying row\nKeir Starmer has labelled Boris Johnson \u201ca coward, not a leader\u201d in refusing to apologise for seeking to overturn Commons rules to save Owen Paterson from punishment, as the pair had a particularly bad-tempered Commons clash over Tory sleaze.\nIn a noisy prime minister\u2019s questions, Lindsay Hoyle, the Speaker, cut Johnson off a number of times as the prime minister sought to avoid answering Starmer\u2019s questions by asking about the Labour leader\u2019s additional work as a lawyer.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think this has done this house any good today,\u201d Hoyle said after Johnson and Starmer ended their exchanges, adding that the Commons needed to \u201cgain respect\u201d from the watching public.\nAfter PMQs was over, following a point of order raised by Tory MP Michael Fabricant, Hoyle also ruled that Starmer should not have called Johnson a coward, and asked he withdraw it. Starmer then said: \u201cI withdraw it \u2013 but he\u2019s not a leader.\u201d\nAhead of a debate later on Wednesday about Johnson\u2019s hastily announced plans to ban MPs from having paid political consultancies, or working too many hours in second jobs, Starmer focused his questions on the subject, and what he said was a wider issue of Johnson\u2019s untrustworthiness.\nNoting that a series of other government figures had apologised for the abortive attempt to save Paterson, the Tory MP who has now resigned, from punishment for breaking lobbying rules by replacing the entire disciplinary system, Starmer said Johnson had not yet done so.\n\u201cSo will he do the decent thing and just say sorry for trying to give the green light to corruption?\u201d he asked.\nThe prime minister declined to apologise, saying: \u201cAs I have said before, it certainly was a mistake to conflate the case of an individual member, no matter how sad, with the point of principle at stake.\u201d\nStarmer replied: \u201cThat\u2019s not an apology. Everybody else has apologised for him, but he won\u2019t apologise for himself. A coward, not a leader.\n\u201cWeeks defending corruption. Yesterday, a screeching, last-minute U-turn to avoid defeat on Labour\u2019s plan to ban MPs from dodgy second contracts. But waving one white flag won\u2019t be enough to restore trust. There are plenty of opposition days to come, and we won\u2019t let the prime minister water down the proposals or pretend it\u2019s job done.\u201d\nSeveral times, Johnson tried to ask Starmer about his outside work as a lawyer he has previously declared while being an MP, including for the law firm Mishcon de Reya.\nThree times, Hoyle interrupted to tell Johnson it was up to him to answer questions, not ask them. On the final occasion, Hoyle appeared notably angry, saying: \u201cPrime minister, sit down. I\u2019m not going to be challenged. You may be the prime minister of this county, but in this house I\u2019m in charge.\u201d\nStarmer returned to the attack, having used earlier questions to ask Johnson if a new rail plan, to be unveiled on Thursday, would ditch previous commitments on having HS2 go to Leeds, and building a new, high-speed Manchester-Leeds rail line.\n\u201cHe has been investigated by every organisation he\u2019s ever been elected to. That\u2019s the difference,\u201d Starmer said. \u201cThe prime minister somehow expects us to believe that he\u2019s the man to clean up Westminster. He led his troops through the sewers to cover up corruption, and he can\u2019t even say sorry.\n\u201cAt the same time his government is engulfed in sleaze. They are rowing back on the promises they made to the north. And it\u2019s working people who are paying the price. Is it any wonder that people are beginning to think that the joke isn\u2019t funny any more?\u201d\nJohnson replied by saying Starmer \u201cseeks to criticise this government while refusing to explain his own position\u201d, adding, \u201cbut his own mish-conduct is absolutely clear to everybody,\u201d a pun on Mishcon de Reya.\nHoyle, believing Johnson had said \u201cmisconduct\u201d, intervened to object: \u201cWe cannot accuse anybody of misconduct.\u201d Johnson clarified what he had said, bringing the lament from Hoyle about the tone of PMQs.",

He said of children who migrate to France without parents or guardians: \u201cThey\u2019re thieves, they\u2019re murderers, they\u2019re rapists, that\u2019s all they are. We must send them back.\u201d\nIf found guilty, he faces a sentence of up to a year in prison and a \u20ac45,000 fine.\nZemmour was not present on Wednesday at the court. His lawyer, Olivier Pardo, said the charges were unfounded and Zemmour\u2019s opponents were seeking to stir up a \u201ctrial by public opinion\u201d.\n\u201cHe\u2019s wanted for \u2018racial hate\u2019 but as far as I know an unaccompanied minor is neither a race, nor a nation, nor an ethnicity,\u201d Pardo told RMC radio. He said Zemmour would not attend the trial because he did not want the court to become a \u201cpolitical arena\u201d.\nSeveral anti-racism and rights groups, including SOS Racisme, filed a complaint against Zemmour. They are joined as civil plaintiffs by numerous local councils in charge of handling child welfare and care for unaccompanied minors.\nThe council for the Seine-Saint-Denis department, north of Paris, said: \u201cWe won\u2019t let these comments be trivialised\u201d. The council complained about the targeting of \u201cforeign non-accompanied minors who come to seek protection in France, as well as all those who work to help them\u201d.\nGerminal Peiro, the Socialist head of the Dordogne department, told France Inter radio: \u201cWe\u2019re responsible for these children and we\u2019re here to defend their interests \u2026 This man made xenophobic and racist comments which are unacceptable in French democracy.\u201d\nZemmour was previously convicted of incitement to racial hatred after justifying discrimination against Black and Arab people in 2010, and of incitement to religious hatred for anti-Islam comments in 2016. He has been tried in several other cases where he was acquitted.\nA Paris court in February acquitted Zemmour on a charge of contesting crimes against humanity \u2013 which is illegal in France \u2013 for arguing in a 2019 television debate that Philippe P\u00e9tain, the head of Vichy\u2019s collaborationist government during the second world war, saved France\u2019s Jews from the Holocaust.\nIn its verdict, the court said Zemmour\u2019s comments negated P\u00e9tain\u2019s role in the extermination. But in acquitting Zemmour, the court said he had spoken in the heat of the moment.\nYet Zemmour in recent weeks has repeated similar comments, and lawyers contesting his acquittal plan to cite that point as evidence when their appeal is heard in January.\nThe verdict in Wednesday\u2019s case is expected to be delivered at a later date.",

When they arrived, they said they had been told by the hospital that suicide had been attempted by someone in the house and it wasn\u2019t \u2018allowed\u2019 in Pakistan.\u201d\nShe said the police threatened her father, saying: \u201c\u2018Either your daughter is going to jail or you are.\u2019 My dad finally gave in and bribed them 10,000 rupees [\u00a342.00].\u201d\nThe police took the bribe and didn\u2019t pursue the case.\nLegislation criminalising suicide has been on the statute books since the days of British rule. Section 325 of the Pakistan penal code makes an attempt punishable by a year\u2019s imprisonment, a fine, or both.\nSuicide was decriminalised in England, Wales and Northern Ireland in the 60s (having never been criminalised in Scotland) but remains a crime in 20 countries around the world.\nThe World Health Organization estimated that in 2019 there were 19,331 suicides in Pakistan, with a rate of 8.9% per 100,000. The WHO also estimates that, globally, for one death there are between 10 and 20 attempts. Based on these numbers, there may be between 130,000 and 260,000 suicide attempts annually in the country.\nHowever, there are no official statistics, and many doctors and academics say the criminalisation of suicide makes it difficult to get a clear picture of its prevalence and of wider incidences of mental health issues.\nThere is also no data on the number of criminal convictions, although it is suspected to be very few. The police, as well as hospital workers, mostly use the little-known law to extort money from survivors and their families.\nNow, however, a bill to repeal section 325 and decriminalise suicide has been passed by the senate and is due to be debated in the National Assembly. If passed it will be presented to the president for assent and become law.\nThe bill faces some opposition, mainly from the interior ministry, responsible for the police, which claims the current law acts as a deterrent. But Taha Sabri, founder of Taskeen, a mental health organisation in Pakistan, says: \u201cWe suspect suicide is a huge cash cow for the police. There is opposition to getting it decriminalised because they would lose a significant revenue source.\u201d\nAnyone who attempts suicide is supposed to be referred to a designated medico-legal centre, says Dr Murad Moosa Khan, professor emeritus of psychiatry at Aga Khan University and former president of the International Association for Suicide Prevention. These centres are for medical cases with criminal implications \u2013 for example, a traffic collision, assault or rape.\nOften doctors in hospital emergency departments will declare attempts accidental out of compassion, according to Sabri. They cannot always do this, however, and so a medico-legal officer gets involved who is duty-bound to report any case to the police.\nThe police visit the survivor\u2019s house, notifying them that a case must be registered because the law is suspected to have been broken.\nThe stigma is such that any mention of mental illness within a family may deter potential marriage suitors and lead to the whole family being ostracised, says Khan. \u201cIn order not to have the case registered, that\u2019s where the element of bribery comes in. I have a lot of anecdotal evidence that this is happening.\u201d\nIt is almost always the poor who are the most vulnerable to extortion, he adds. Those with money can go to private facilities for treatment where staff will be discreet.\nDr Summaiya Syed is head of the medico-legal department at Jinnah postgraduate medical centre in Karachi, one of the country\u2019s largest hospitals.\n\u201cI have seen how suicide attempts are downplayed and made to appear \u2018accidental\u2019, or how an attempt can lead to harassment with the obvious motive of making some easy cash,\u201d she says. \u201cSomething has to be done regarding decriminalisation.\u201d\nPeople who attempt suicide need support, she adds. \u201cInstead of answering their cry for help, we are punishing them. Rather than sending them to a psychologist, we are sending them to the wolves. Why are we doing this?\u201d\nSyed believes the system is \u201ca mess\u201d. \u201cThe key thing at play is social taboo,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat prompts people to not report suicide? It\u2019s better to make it look like an accident \u2026 People are ostracised and shunned \u2026 If you don\u2019t change the thinking of the people, you don\u2019t change the systems.\u201d\nIf section 325 is repealed, it will allow healthcare professionals to report attempted suicide without risking prosecution for their patients. It may also allow survivors to seek mental health support, says Sabri.\nAttitudes are beginning to change, and the discussions in parliament reflect this. Tabri says: \u201cIt is the first time suicide has been spoken about on such a level \u2026 There\u2019s a lot of hope for the future if parties can pass this law.\u201d\nFarooqui is now married and is open about what happened with her husband and close friends. Her extended family were never told, she says. \u201cThey would have mocked me \u2026 and questioned my upbringing or called me insane. Suicide attempts shouldn\u2019t be criminalised. The person attempting should be given help and comfort, rather than [the police] making them feel more horrible.\u201d\n*Name has been changed to protect identity\n In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

        "content": "Soho theatre, LondonThe standup\u2019s rich and playful show about the menopause combines ingenious silliness with campaigning ferocity\nA handful of times in the opening stages of Bridget Christie\u2019s new show, she stumbles over or forgets her lines. The critic sharpens his pen: is Christie under-rehearsed or \u2013 perish the thought! \u2013 might her supreme comic powers be on the wane? But not for the last time tonight, the comedian is a step ahead of the crowd. This show is about life as \u201ca 50-year-old menopausal woman\u201d, and hesitation, forgetfulness \u2013 and hot flushes \u2013 are all part of its carefully worked-out modus operandi.\nEven aside from its underexposure as a topic for public conversation \u2013 a point she makes most emphatically \u2013 could there be a topic better suited to Christie\u2019s style of comedy than the menopause? Once again, this is a show that perfectly marries blustery campaigning material with blithering clown comedy \u2013 the indignities, the scattiness and the sudden, ahem, \u201cpower surges\u201d of that midlife experience all perfect fodder for an act whose comedy already worked to scatty, surging rhythms.\nWhich isn\u2019t to say Christie is cruising along in her comfort zone. Far from it: one routine after another finds her making us laugh in surprising ways, and the climactic section \u2013 about a flasher \u2013 is a mini-masterpiece, flowering from inauspicious beginnings into a routine that calls back to jokes, motifs and arguments from the whole preceding hour.\nBefore that, there\u2019s just so much to enjoy. One section on the invisibility of women over 50 rejoices in the comedy of cartoon fury while still lending weight to the original complaint \u2013 a classic Christie trick. Another compares the bad-faith comedy of Dave Chappelle and Ricky Gervais to Christie\u2019s mother\u2019s experience of giving birth to Bridget \u2013 not an analogy you can imagine any other comedian making, and all the funnier for it.\nThere\u2019s also a tart aside about Fleabag, and a sublime setpiece about Christie\u2019s current failure to remember the most basic words. She dramatises this fraying connection between her brain and the tip of her tongue as a frenetic dialogue between herself and her alarmed kids, a device deployed again in tirades about Tupperware and an incident in a Homebase car park \u2013 both hilariously overblown, with Christie waggling about, arms everywhere, like an inflatable tube man. That she\u2019s behaving like this while mothering just multiplies the comedy.\nEven the show\u2019s relative weaknesses reveal themselves to be part of the larger plan. The Charles II bit feels like recycling from a previous show \u2013 but that does serve Christie\u2019s point about crumbling menopause memory. A gag about Boris Johnson\u2019s lying feels a bit obvious, but she keeps reapplying it, to different iterations of male entitlement, with a greater comic (and ideological) yield each time. Then there\u2019s the stunt with which she opens the set, which doesn\u2019t really fly \u2013 until you realise that its lack of impact is integral to the joke Christie keeps telling, ever more amusingly, for the first 10 minutes of the show.\nShe is, in short, wise to us, even when we think otherwise \u2013 and it\u2019s a keen pleasure to be in the company of an act in such control over her rich, playful material. And all in the service not only of great silliness and self-mockery, but of Christie\u2019s liberating public-information agenda. The menopause needn\u2019t be anything to fear, it may even be liberating \u2013 and, on the evidence of Who Am I? it in no way hinders the creation of joyous, fervent and complex comedy shows.\nBridget Christie is at Folkestone Quarterhouse on 2 December; then Leicester Square theatre, London, 14-18 December.",

We are working collaboratively with our wholesale partner Morrisons to restore in-store product availability as quickly as possible.\u201d\nHe said that sales at shops converted to the Morrisons Daily format were seeing a \u201cstepchange in performance\u201d, with customers spending more and visiting more often.

And therefore, of course, it is a very big problem for us if the British government is going to change that. We find that unacceptable and it\u2019s a breach of our agreement,\u201d he said.\nThe charge opens a new front for the UK government, which is already embroiled in a rancorous dispute with France over fishing rights, against a wider backdrop of post-Brexit tensions with the EU.\nDogger Bank, a large shallow sandbank about 90 miles north-east of the Humber estuary, has been fished by Danish boats for centuries and is among the country\u2019s most important fishing grounds, according to the Danish government.\nUnder the Brexit trade and cooperation agreement struck between the EU and the UK last Christmas Eve, EU fishers can continue to access UK waters as before until 30 June 2026, a transition to delay the blow of reduced fishing rights in future.\nThe deal also commits both sides to \u201cpromoting the long-term sustainability\u201d of the 70 common fish in the shared waters.\nPrehn said Danish fishers \u201care already in a very difficult situation due to Brexit so this would be even more difficult for them and we can\u2019t really accept that\u201d.\nWhile he said it was premature to discuss potential retaliation, he revealed his disappointment over how relations between the UK and Denmark had deteriorated since Brexit.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really difficult to make an agreement and just one year after we have these problems with one part; that is not really acceptable, that is not how we usually make agreements. With the UK we used to have a very good relationship,\u201d Prehn said.\nHe was speaking from Brussels as the UK and EU embark on the final sprint of negotiations to set catch limits for fishing in 2022, ahead of a 10 December deadline.\nDenmark and the UK entered the then European Economic Community together in 1973, but arrived too late to influence the first version of the common fisheries policy, leaving a lingering sense of resentment for British officials.\nBetween 2013 and 2020, Danish fishers landed catches worth 27m DKK (\u00a33.05m) a year from bottom trawling in Dogger Bank, mostly sand eel, which is used on fish farms but is also an important source of food for puffins, kittiwakes and seals.\nGermany and the Netherlands also have fishing interests in Dogger Bank, which environmentalists say has been overworked by trawls and dredges, causing a drastic decline in fish.\nBottom trawling involves dragging weighted nets across the sea floor.\nEnvironmentalists have welcomed the government\u2019s decision to protect Dogger Bank, but said the UK needed to show the same efforts when it came to protecting fish targeted by British fishers.\n\u201cThe UK is proposing a brave and good deal on the Dogger Bank,\u201d said Irene Kingma, a Dutch marine biologist. \u201cIt\u2019s also very easy \u2026 when it\u2019s not your fisheries that you\u2019re impacting.\u201d\n\u201cThe UK is being very progressive on all environmental issues as long as it\u2019s not interfering with their own fishing interest,\u201d she added. \u201cThey are good at [protecting] Dogger Bank, because its flatfish are fished by the Dutch, and they are good at the industrial fisheries [sandeel] because that\u2019s fished by the Danish. But they are very much not willing to move on cod when it\u2019s the Scottish fishing boats.\u201d\nThe UK government rejects the claim it is in breach of the TCA, arguing it allows both sides to decide on regulatory measures. A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: \u201cThe UK is a global leader in the fight to protect our seas. As an independent coastal state the UK can decide on the regulatory measures which apply to fishing in our waters, which includes taking measures to follow scientific advice and protect our marine environment.\u201d",

Led by Bayern Munich\u2019s brilliant Alphonso Davies and Jonathan David, a Ligue 1 champion with Lille last season, the green shoots of potential have been poking through this year. At the summer\u2019s not-exactly-known-for-its-competitiveness Concacaf Gold Cup (won by either Mexico or USA! USA!!

There will be no revision.\nBut the request at Cop26 to improve those targets next year included an important clause.\nThose targets should \u201calign with the Paris Agreement temperature goal\u201d of keeping global warming to well below 2C and \u201cpursue efforts\u201d towards a 1.5C limit.\nIn an attempt to push back against criticism over their reluctance to set a new 2030 target, both prime minister Scott Morrison and emissions reduction minister Angus Taylor have instead held up projections of the country\u2019s emissions.\nDuring his speech to the summit, Morrison said \u2013 without qualification \u2013 that Australia\u2019s emissions in 2030 would be 35% below 2005 levels.\nSo if Australia did actually reduce emissions by this amount, would that align with the Paris temperature goals?\nAfter the conference, Taylor told the ABC that \u201cwhat really counts here\u201d was getting to the overall global outcome.\n\u201cWe absolutely support the Paris agreement goals which is to come in below 2 degrees,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cAnd seek, make best efforts to get to 1.5 degrees. I mean, that is how Paris is framed.\u201d\nDoes the government\u2019s projection of a 35% emissions reduction \u201csupport the Paris agreement goals\u201d as Taylor claims?\n\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d says Bill Hare, the chief executive of Climate Analytics \u2013 a respected group of analysts that helps produce the global Climate Action Tracker.\nHare said: \u201cAustralia would need to make 60% or more reductions by 2030 to be in line with the Paris agreement and to be consistent with what the European Union and the UK are doing.\n\u201cIf all other countries followed a similar level of emissions reduction to Australia compared to their economic circumstances, then the world would warm by about 3C.\n\u201cThe IPCC has been very clear that, on the objective science, by the time you get to 2.5C and 3C warming, we are facing catastrophic consequences for natural and human systems.\u201d\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\n\n Hare says the Great Barrier Reef would be \u201cwell and truly dead\u201d with warming of 3C, with food and water supplies around the world \u201cin a lot of trouble\u201d.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge mess. There\u2019s every reason to avoid that,\u201d says Hare.\nMorrison\u2019s assessment of a 35% reduction in emissions is far rosier.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re going to achieve and that\u2019s what actually matters. What matters is what you actually achieve,\u201d he said.\nDespite running a campaign ahead of Glasgow that was nominally supportive of a target to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, the climate science denialism of many of News Corp Australia\u2019s key commentators continues.\nOn Monday, Andrew Bolt screamed the \u201cglobal warming scare is based on lies.\u201d\nOn Sunday, longtime denialist Piers Akerman raised a furry old chestnut of the climate science denial movement and gave it new life in his column.\nBecause the greenhouse gas CO2 is a small percentage of the atmosphere, we apparently shouldn\u2019t worry about it.\nAkerman wrote: \u201cActivists ignore the science which shows that CO2, which is demonised, makes up 0.04 per cent by volume of the atmosphere and 95 per cent of it comes from natural sources, such as volcanoes and the oceans.\u201d\nAkerman is playing a lame and dishonest trick on his readers that is undone with any high school understanding of the greenhouse effect.\nMost of the atmosphere is made up of gases that don\u2019t contribute to the greenhouse effect (nitrogen, oxygen and a bit of argon) and aren\u2019t relevant here.\nNatural sources of CO2 are also irrelevant. The problem comes when you take CO2 that has been locked away for tens of millions of years in the form of coal, oil and gas, and then burn it \u2013 adding that CO2 to the atmosphere.\nWhat are relevant are the changes to the amount of greenhouse gases which actually make up less than 1% of the atmosphere.\nBut even then, percentages are much less relevant because the gases don\u2019t warm the planet at the same rate (for example, methane is more potent than carbon dioxide, but it doesn\u2019t stay in the atmosphere for as long).\nThe amount of CO2 in the atmosphere has gone up by about 20% in the last 20 years. We are now at about 420 ppm (parts per million) \u2013 levels not seen on Earth for at least four million years.\nIf Akerman thinks a tiny percentage of something means it\u2019s not relevant, then consider that raising your blood alcohol level from zero to 500ppm means you can\u2019t legally drive a car.",

        "content": "Six months after Fair Work Act amendments, union says the move to permanent roles remains \u2018abysmal across the sector\u2019\nAustralian universities have converted as few as 1% of their casual staff to permanent roles six months after the labour laws changed, leaving \u201cshocking\u201d levels of insecurity in an industry already hard hit by Covid-triggered job losses.\nEarlier this week, staff at the University of Newcastle conducted a 12-hour digital \u201csit-in\u201d to protest after having just five of 2,300 casual staff converted to full-time work.\nThe National Tertiary Education Union (NTEU) described the conversion rate as \u201cabysmal across the sector\u201d.\nIn March, the federal government amended the Fair Work Act to mandate that casual staff who meet two criteria be offered full-time or permanent part-time positions. To be eligible, they must have been employed for at least 12 months and had worked a regular pattern of hours for at least the six previous of those months.\nSince many university staff are on short-term rolling contracts with semester or summer breaks, few have been eligible to make the conversion from casual roles.\nFor instance, out of 11,300 staff at the University of Melbourne, just 112 have been offered permanent roles, according to the NTEU. Within the law school and the school of engineering, there were no conversions at all.\nFor Jessica Marian, a casual employee at the university and an NTEU delegate, the initial rejection was made worse because she was among dozens who received a form letter that omitted the reason for the refusal. It read:\n\u201cThe university has assessed the hours that you have worked for us over the last 12 months and has determined that you meet the eligibility criteria for conversion, \u2026 However  the university has determined that this is reasonable grounds (in accordance with the legislation) not to offer to convert your role to a permanent position.\u201d\n\u201cI felt like just a loser,\u201d said Marian, a part-time teacher of English literature and an administrator at the university. \u201cIt was just shocking, and I was upset.\u201d\nFour hours later, \u201cthe follow-up letter was just as heartless\u201d, telling her she was not even eligible for conversion, she said: \u201cIt\u2019s not just what\u2019s legal \u2013 it\u2019s about what\u2019s conscionable about the treatment of casuals.\u201d\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nAccording to Alison Barnes, NTEU national president, well over 50% of undergraduate teaching is done by people with no employment security, nor sick or holiday pay.\n\u201cUniversities have really run on the backs of poorly paid, insecure workers for decades,\u201d she said.\nDetails of the poor conversion rates come as eight university vice chancellors are scheduled to join a Commonwealth Economic Development of Australia (CEDA) panel on Thursday in Sydney.\n\u201cAustralia\u2019s higher education sector is vital to the nation\u2019s future workforce needs and economic prosperity,\u201d CEDA said. \u201cThere is not a sector, industry or business which is not impacted by, and dependent on, the success of universities.\u201d\nStuart Andrews, executive director of Australian Higher Education Industrial Association representing 32 universities, including Melbourne university, said casual staff were \u201can integral and very important component of any university workforce\u201d.\n\u201cMany have intermittent or short-term employment, they don\u2019t have an ongoing regular pattern of hours, and don\u2019t fit the profile for permanent jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cThe vast majority of the university casual staff workforce therefore don\u2019t qualify for conversion to permanency under the Fair Work Act.\u201d\n \nEmail:\u00a0sign up for our\u00a0daily morning and afternoon email newsletters\nApp:\u00a0download our free app\u00a0and never miss the biggest stories\nSocial:\u00a0follow us on YouTube,\u00a0TikTok,\u00a0Instagram,\u00a0Facebook\u00a0or\u00a0Twitter\nPodcast:\u00a0listen to our daily episodes on\u00a0Apple Podcasts,\u00a0Spotify\u00a0or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app\nThe issue, which Andrews described as \u201cnot surprising\u201d given many teachers are PhD students who work while studying or have permanent jobs elsewhere, will be \u201cfurther explored\u201d during bargaining talks between unions and university across the country.\nACTU secretary Sally McManus said the low conversion rate demonstrates \u201cthe Morrison government\u2019s proposed solution for rampant casualisation was laughable from the start\u201d.\n\u201cThe new casual conversion laws allow bosses almost limitless discretion in denying long-term casual workers the right to convert to permanent roles,\u201d she said.\nThe ACTU is preparing details from its union members on conversion rates in other sectors of the economy.",

        "content": "Making Australia\u2019s freestanding homes greener is mainly a matter of time and money, but for apartment dwellers the process is more complex\nWith the federal government dragging its feet on legislating to reduce carbon emissions, many Australians are decreasing their individual carbon footprints, changing their lifestyles and even their homes to become more sustainable.\nInstalling solar panels, solar hot water systems and rain tanks is relatively straightforward on detached houses, but the increasing number of apartment dwellers is posing new challenges for sustainable living.\nPeter Newman, professor of sustainability at Curtin University, says making apartment buildings sustainable is now \u201can issue of how, rather than why \u2026 It\u2019s something we have to do. It\u2019s no longer a choice.\u201d\nIndividual apartment dwellers could use more energy-efficient appliances and heat-reflecting window films to reduce their environmental footprint, Newman says, but the biggest changes would come from modifying the building to add solar power or insulation.\n\u201cBoth those things need the strata title group to work on it as a shared decision by the whole community rather than just individuals. They are fundamental to being more sustainable and they depend on the group working together.\u201d\nNewman says the time has come for apartment owners to think of the big picture. \u201cThey have to see that their money is being put to use not just for them but \u2026 the whole planet.\u201d\nIn Western Australia, a group of unit owners are retrofitting solar panels to their 21-year-old apartment complex and setting up a renewable energy trading system.\nOwner David Beard, together with fellow owner Henry Christie, has convinced the body corporate to install solar panels on the four-storey building in West Perth.\nChristie had wanted to install solar for years, but said he put it into the too-hard basket until Beard joined his campaign. Together they looked at power bills for running joint equipment such as lifts and pool pumps and calculated likely solar savings.\nBeard says that with 14 apartments and two commercial offices in the complex, he had to convince the owners of the benefits: \u201cI think there was a fair degree of \u2018We should be doing this to be environmentally friendly\u2019, but the economics still had to stack up.\u201d\nThe owners had a lump sum ready to spend on the project, diverting their reserve fund from a new lift to install 30KW of solar. \u201cWe worked out that the savings to individuals and to the strata company itself would help get the reserve fund back up to the amount required by law \u2026 it was going to pay for itself within five years,\u201d Beard says.\nUsing a blockchain system developed by energy trading software company Powerledger, the strata receives 10% of the generated power to run common property, while owners are allocated a share of the solar power according to their strata investment, and can trade unused power with each other.\nBeard says the project took about 12 months to research and set up, despite pandemic-related delays. Now that permission has been granted to switch from individual meters to a single shared meter, the panels should be installed next month. His advice: \u201cDo your homework and think of all the things people might object to \u2026 We were fortunate that we had the money in our strata already so there was no initial bill \u2026 The fact that we had the money made it painless.\u201d\nSome councils, including the City of Melbourne and Waverley in Sydney, now offer rebate and incentive schemes to retrofit apartment blocks with solar panels. Researching and learning about schemes that are available in your area could be a good way to kick-start conversations with fellow members of the owners\u2019 corporation.\nHowever, the path to a more sustainable apartment complex is not always straightforward. Mark Skrzypek has been trying for years to create a rooftop garden for his small apartment complex in Melbourne\u2019s South Yarra neighbourhood.  He says the green roof was the final flourish in a campaign to make the complex more community minded and environmentally friendly.\n\u201cWe\u2019d done everything we could. We\u2019d redone the gardens. We\u2019d made them more communal and enticing. We put in a worm farm out the back \u2026 We ran workshops and taught everyone how to use them.\u201d\nSkrzypek\u2019s three-storey, art deco, double-brick apartment building has 12 units and a sensational river view from the unused roof. Over the past six years he has worked with several other owners to research how to add a green roof, and convince every owner to go ahead with the project.\nThe process has been complicated. \u201cIt\u2019s all those things about weight and weight bearing: the weight of soil and the types of plants that will survive,\u201d Skrzypek says. \u201cWe have mirrored walls from neighbouring buildings and it\u2019s astronomically hot up here.\u201d\nInspired by a similar project at 38 Westbury Street in East St Kilda, Skrzypek conceived of the South Yarra project as a true green roof, with grass and plantings to reduce the heat-island effect.\nHe says the engineering involved meant the project was not cheap. \u201cIt\u2019s a hell of a lot of money \u2013 in excess of $100,000 \u2013 and we\u2019re aware that we\u2019re playing with other people\u2019s money so you want it to be right and you want it to be a success \u2026 There were lots of meetings, lots of talk over several AGMs about what it would mean to their tenants and their investment.\u201d\nWith owners reluctant to raise a levy, Skrzypek says they made a long-term plan to save the funds. However, pandemic lockdowns and inflated building costs have added complications. \u201cParticularly with the second lockdown, prices went through the roof. I think it went up by 30%. We realised we no longer had the money to do it.\u201d\nInstead, the original concept has been traded for shared garden boxes, but even that has been complicated. \u201cNo one is an expert in the field so we found it fraught with surprises,\u201d Skrzypek says. Lockdown delays allowing, he is hoping for a garden by Christmas.\nDespite all the hurdles, he says he would do it again. \u201cWe all want to be more connected with nature \u2026 I think this is the way forward for cities.\u201d",

        "content": "In the powerful new documentary Simple As Water, the lives of families escaping war to be stranded across the globe are shared\nI was a refugee as a child, towed along by family as we escaped war in Sri Lanka. My memory of the whole ordeal is vague. There were stops that lasted weeks and months, as we were left in limbo in Hong Kong, Tokyo and Vancouver, before finding a home in Toronto.\nYou meet a lot of people throughout such journeys, fellow migrants you live with for a time at refugee camps or shared apartments. They come in and out, leaving behind disjointed and scattered stories, memories of transit without a beginning or end. Simple As Water, a mosaic-like HBO documentary about Syrian refugees, affectively evokes that sensation.\nMegan Mylan\u2019s film gently breathes in the scope of the Syrian refugee crisis by moving from family to family who are landed or stranded temporarily in places like Greece, Turkey and the United States. Like a collection of short stories, the film spends a little bit of time with each family, focusing on the protective bond between parents and their children, capturing fragments of their lives before moving on to the next.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a cohesive or linear experience,\u201d Mylan tells the Guardian on a Zoom call from her New York apartment. \u201cIt\u2019s constant upheaval and repositioning. I wanted the film structure to echo the reality of the people in it and not give a tidiness that wasn\u2019t true to that experience.\u201d\nMylan is the Oscar-winning film-maker behind Smile Pinki and Lost Boys of Sudan. The latter film, which she co-directed with Jon Shenk, was a story about young refugees making the journey to the US and acclimatizing to their new home. That experience documenting a migration story didn\u2019t immediately compel Mylan to make a film about the Syrian refugee crisis. She considered for a time that she may have exhausted everything she could say on the matter.\nBut she followed the news attentively: the headlines and footage of migrants crossing barbed wire or riding on smuggler boats from Turkey to Greece. She was latching onto images of parents cradling their children during these perilous journeys. Mylan has a child who was three years old as the crisis was unfolding. \u201cAs a newish mother, it was so primal,\u201d she says. \u201cThe way I was experiencing the world was all through his eyes; both its joys and its injustices. And I just kept thinking, what would I do in that situation?\u201d\nAnd like so many people in the western world, Mylan stood to attention when she saw devastating photos of Alan Kurdi, the three-year-old Syrian boy whose lifeless body washed ashore in Turkey, after the inflatable boat his family boarded to get to Greece capsized. \u201cI remember that morning I had also taught my son to close the Velcro ties on his shoes. And that little boy had socks and little Velcro closures. Someone put those socks and shoes on him. His father had survived. I just kept thinking of that pain of having not been able to protect. It felt like a valid point of entry that I hadn\u2019t seen.\u201d\nSimple As Water gathers a diverse set of parents, or parental figures, and the people they look after, like Yasmin who lives in a portside refugee encampment in Athens with her four kids while coping with the \u201cKafkaesque\u201d bureaucracy of transit. Her husband, Safwan, escaped separately to Germany, spending years in touch with his family strictly through iPhone. Samra works as a field hand in Turkey while her 12-year-old son steps up to become the man of the house, taking care of his four siblings. Omar works as an appliance delivery man in Pennsylvania trying to secure a future for his kid brother, an amputee named Abdulrahman. You might have seen the latter on CNN as an 11-year-old, recalling the rocket blast in Syria that claimed his leg.\nDiaa\u2019s story stands apart from the rest. The elderly mother remains in Syria, after half the population fled. She affectionately takes care of a grown, developmentally delayed son, while worrying over another son who \u2013 as we learn through drips of information \u2013 has been disappeared. Her life, captured with an anonymous crew in Syria, is a different kind of purgatory. Living under the assumption that her son was abducted by Isis, she scans Facebook pages and makes WhatsApp calls, trying to learn his fate.\nThere are details to this story that I only learn from Mylan. The missing son was a citizen journalist. Most would assume he was abducted by Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime, which was the more common narrative at the time. But witnesses saw him and his girlfriend taken from their cars by men who they thought appeared more like Isis.\nWe don\u2019t hear these things in the film because the film-makers never compel their subjects to explain or narrate for the audience. They opted instead for an unobtrusive fly-on-the-wall approach, an observational style where the people in the documentary choose what they want to reveal at any given moment.\nMylan says the film has \u201cthe scaffolding of journalism\u201d, but is guided by humanity. \u201cWe wanted to get the right stuff on the screen. But we wanted to get to it the right way, too.\u201d And in Diaa\u2019s case, the withheld details don\u2019t take away from a story about a mother overcome by a \u201cterrifying helplessness\u201d not knowing her son\u2019s fate.\nThe unobtrusive approach and spare details are heartbreakingly effective in Yasmin and Safwan\u2019s story. They have four children. We slowly gather that there was a fifth: a young child seen briefly as the remaining kids watch old home videos on a phone. His fate is never explained. All we learn is that he\u2019s gone. The film-makers never coax an explanation for the camera. Mylan knows that an audience would immediately fill in the gaps with everything we know about the Syrian refugee crisis, whether we learned it from previous documentaries, news footage or those galvanizing photos of Alan Kurdi. \u201cIf you\u2019ve had your ears open at all \u2013 and if you\u2019re going to come to this film, you likely have \u2013 we felt like we didn\u2019t have to do all of that \u2018catch you up\u2019.\u201d\n\u201cPart of what I love about documentary is the puzzle of it,\u201d Mylan adds. \u201cHere\u2019s what they chose to give me. Here are the layers of their experience that they shared. And together with my editor, I have to figure out how to piece that together to give you enough that you feel like you understand.\u201d\nSimple As Water is now available on HBO and HBO Max with a UK date to be announced",

That was pushed back to July 2022 \u2013 a date embraced by the Scottish National party and the Scottish Green party in their election manifestos this year.\nLorna Slater, the Scottish Green minister in charge of delivering the scheme, confirmed on Wednesday that the government was now unsure when it would start and was urgently negotiating with retailers and producers.\nJohn Mayhew, the director of the Association for the Protection of Rural Scotland, which leads the Scottish campaign for the scheme, said he was furious. \u201cFour years ago we were promised a world-leading deposit return system,\u201d he said. \u201cNow Scotland looks like an object lesson in how not to deliver one of the world\u2019s most basic and widely deployed environmental measures. Sad to say, we wouldn\u2019t be totally surprised if it now never happened.\u201d\nNina Schrank, a plastics campaigner for Greenpeace UK, said: \u201cThis shambolic delay to the long-awaited deposit return scheme is embarrassing for a government which loves to shout about its green credentials. Every year of delay means millions more bottles being dumped or burned.\u201d\nTo derision from opposition parties, Slater said the chaos of Brexit, the problems faced by retailers during the Covid crisis and uncertainties about VAT charges on deposits had been obstacles to the scheme\u2019s introduction.\nShe said the Treasury has confirmed on Tuesday that it believed VAT would need to be charged on deposits, and that would make the scheme \u2013 which is based on a 20p refundable deposit for each bottle and can \u2013 unaffordable. Slater said that was \u201cdeeply disappointing\u201d.\nMercedes Villalba, Scottish Labour\u2019s environment spokesperson, pressed Slater on why the government had dropped its July 2022 start date since VAT charges had not been a barrier to deposit-return schemes in other European countries.\nSlater said she was negotiating with retailers and producers \u201cto figure out what the shortest practical time is possible to implement this scheme given the challenges around Brexit and around the pandemic. This is constant industry engagement.\u201d\nLiam McArthur, the Scottish Liberal Democrat MSP for Orkney, said the scheme posed significant challenges for small rural and island businesses. \u201cWhy is the government making such a mess of delivering DRS [deposit return scheme] in Scotland?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cI\u2019m absolutely aware of the criticality to industry of getting a firm delivery date,\u201d Slater replied.\nMaurice Golden, for the Scottish Conservatives, said contracts for the scheme were \u201cshrouded in secrecy, with a multimillion tender process hidden from the public and this parliament,\u201d as the government had contracted it out to a private company set up by industry.\nThe Scottish Retail Consortium, which represents major supermarkets, said it was no surprise that the scheme had been delayed as the 2022 start date was unrealistic.\n\u201cRetailers will raise a weary eyebrow that after this long-postponed announcement there will be a further delay until they receive clarity and visibility on the launch of the scheme,\u201d said Ewan MacDonald-Russell, the consortium\u2019s head of policy. \u201cThis process has been drawn out to a pretty farcical degree and needs to be urgently resolved. A new go-live date, no earlier than 2023, needs to be confirmed swiftly.\u201d",

Michael had an aptitude for building lasting friendships, whether through chairing the Restricted Growth Association (2003-07), lecturing on critical disability studies at the University of Middlesex, his directorship of the disability advocacy organisation Shaping Our Lives (2018-21), or through his work in social care and his wide range of interests.\nI met Mike in London in the early 1980s, when we both worked for Camden social services department. Later, we joined forces as shop stewards for the local branch of the public sector union Nalgo (now incorporated into Unison). Mike was passionate about social justice and worked hard to represent the interests of staff in need of help. In the 1990s he served as a trustee to the British Association of Social Workers.\nOn visiting Mike\u2019s flat for the first time, I was struck by the huge, framed wall prints of Russian communist iconography, depicting strong, proud images of Russian industrial workers. These works reflected Mike\u2019s overlapping interests in art, fashion, politics and travel; he regularly travelled, often alone, to non-tourist destinations, such as (then) eastern bloc countries, to enquire for himself about life under different regimes.\nAlso in Mike\u2019s flat were his display of model buses, a form of transport he regularly used and one about whose regional history he had an almost encyclopedic knowledge. Mike could also wax lyrical on the merits of the Trabant car and, eventually, he journeyed to Germany in one with his childhood friend Will Self, the subject of a BBC Radio 4 series, Self Drives: The Trabant, broadcast in 2016.\nOne of four children of Charles Shamash, a dentist, and Arabella (also Shamash by birth), Mike grew up and lived all his life in north-west London. He went to University College school in Hampstead, and studied sociology and politics at the University of Warwick before joining Camden council as a social work assistant. Later he completed an MA in criminology at the University of Middlesex.\nHe loved the city of his birth, despite the demise of some landmarks that were personally significant to him. He and other contributors memorialised these on a website he and an old college friend initiated, called London RIP. As someone with restricted growth, Mike was noticeable when out in public and too often experienced being stared at or even ridiculed. Although never lost for the right expletive, Mike was rarely downhearted and his positive outlook was one of his many strengths, along with warmth, interest in others, and sense of fun.\nTen years ago Mike met Helen Tonge and together they had a daughter, Lydia. Mike rejoiced in fatherhood and adored Lydia, who is now two years old and is proving to be as sociable as her dad.\nMike is survived by Helen and Lydia, his mother, his sister, Adele, and brothers, Jack and Philip.",

        "content": "Picking a fight with family doctors is usually a bad idea for ministers but some parts of media are on government\u2019s side  \nTalking to MPs recently, an effusive Sajid Javid lauded the vital role paid by \u201cour fantastic GPs\u201d. But his warm words are unlikely to have persuaded many of England\u2019s family doctors that the new health secretary was softening his stance in an increasingly bitter dispute over his insistence on face-to-face appointments for any patient that asks.\nThe row has led to the first clash between the government and medical profession since Javid\u2019s predecessor Jeremy Hunt confronted junior doctors in 2015 over weekend working, which led to a year-long struggle including a series of strikes by trainee medics.\n\u201cGPs are under savage attack by the media and the government,\u201d says one senior doctors\u2019 leader, referring to a recent barrage of hostile coverage of family doctors in government-friendly newspapers.\nFamily doctors believe they have been wrongly portrayed as lazy, overpaid and overly relaxed about the risk of missing signs of a serious illness by conducting appointments remotely \u2013 a practice Matt Hancock, Javid\u2019s predecessor, advised them in 2018 to embrace. They are also fuming about plans to \u201cname and shame\u201d practices that don\u2019t offer enough face-to-face appointments and force GPs who earn more than \u00a3150,000 a year from NHS work to declare it.\nJavid\u2019s edict on in-person consultations could escalate into industrial action by GPs though not outright withdrawal of their labour. The British Medical Association (BMA) has undertaken an indicative ballot of GP practices to gauge appetite for taking action short of a strike to show their anger. The union\u2019s GP committee meets on Thursday to analyse the results and decide what to do next.\nThe stakes are high for both sides. Javid is taking on the group of workers the public trusts most: doctors. Research by Ipsos Mori found that 72% of Britons trust medics while only 15% trust government ministers.\n\u201cThis conflict is fraught with danger for the government and has been poorly thought through. There is little to be gained in picking a fight with hard-working healthcare workers in the midst of the pandemic,\u201d says Conservative MP Dr Daniel Poulter, a former health minister. Another Tory MP says: \u201cThis is a political misjudgment.\u201d\nThe immediate flashpoint is whether GP appointments are conducted in person, as happens in about 60% of cases currently, down from 80% pre-pandemic, or remotely. GPs say stubbornly high Covid infections mean it makes sense to limit numbers who come into the surgery and that many patients either don\u2019t need to be seen in person or are happy to interact by phone or video call.\nPublic frustration at the difficulty in getting to see a GP had been growing for several years before Covid. But the BMA, Royal College of GPs and opposition parties at Westminster say the real problem is the falling number of full-time GPs at a time when demand for care has been rising due to the growing and ageing population. Family doctors are looking after on average 300 more patients each than they were in 2015 \u2013 a 15% rise.\nJavid recently admitted the government is likely to break its 2019 promise to boost the number of GPs by 6,000 by 2024. Hunt failed to deliver his target \u2013 5,000 more by 2020 \u2013 because GPs retiring early outnumbered younger doctors joining the profession.\n\u201cThe public will always tend to trust doctors \u2013 particularly their GP \u2013 over politicians. The longer the conflict continues, the more it allows GPs to highlight the failure of previous secretaries of state for health to deliver the 5,000 extra GPs that were promised in the 2015 Conservative manifesto,\u201d adds Poulter, himself an NHS psychiatrist.\nBeccy Baird, the King\u2019s Fund lead on primary care, says the row matters because \u201cfor most people general practice is the face of the NHS, the part of the NHS they access most in any given year\u201d. But GPs\u2019 unique status as self-employed contractors, rather than directly employed NHS staff, can frustrate ministers, she adds.\n\u201cThere are long memories of the 2004 GP contract debacle, which saw GPs being able to opt out of out-of-hours work for a 6% loss of income. Some in government believe that must never happen again; that GPs can\u2019t be seen to \u2018win\u2019 in contract negotiations.\u201d\nA YouGov poll of 5,425 adults in the UK found that 66% prefer a face-to-face appointment, 5% a video call and 25% don\u2019t mind which it is. Anna Quigley, the research director at pollsters Ipsos Mori, says: \u201cAccess \u2013 getting through when needed and the ease of making an appointment \u2013 is really important to patients. The qualitative and quantitative data on remote v face-to-face appointments suggests that remote appointments work well for some.\n\u201cWhat seems most important to patients, though, is having the choice of appointment or knowing that a [face-to-face] appointment is available should they really need it.\u201d Javid has stressed that patient choice is the principle driving his hardline stance.\nWho is likely to win the battle for hearts and minds over GP access? Quigley says it\u2019s unclear who the public will side with if the BMA does decide to take industrial action. \u201cWe know there\u2019s a lot of support for the NHS and those who work in it. When junior doctors went on strike the majority of the public supported them. Some 57% supported the all-out strike, which affected emergency [A&E] care [but] it was 66% when emergency care wasn\u2019t affected.\u201d\nDan Wellings, an expert on public attitudes towards the NHS at the King\u2019s Fund, points out that previously issues of public access have translated into upset with the government. But, he adds, it is possible that this time doctors end up as the losers in the court of public opinion.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to know where the public will point the finger of blame. There is a risk this might be different, in part because of the coverage from some sections of the media, and that a larger than usual proportion of the public might blame GPs.\n\u201cIt\u2019s also important to point out that the difference with the junior doctor strikes is that the actual effect of that was felt by a relatively small percentage [of people] whereas access to primary care is key when it comes to overall perceptions of the NHS because it is the service used by the largest proportion of people.\u201d",

        "content": "My friend John Lambert, who has died aged 75 of cancer, was a director, performer and founder of the Q20 community theatre project in Bradford. He was also a Labour councillor for seven years and was among those who masterminded the restoration and refurbishment of the city\u2019s Alhambra theatre.\nJohn established Q20 in 1969 with the aim of bringing theatre to a wider audience. It started in his parents\u2019 house and grew to become a thriving company and business. John created stage productions throughout Yorkshire and ran a full-time theatre-in-education programme, visiting local schools.\nHe was born in Baildon, West Yorkshire, to Joan (nee Heaton) and Hugh Lambert. When he was young, the family moved to Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia), where Hugh worked as a hydrogeologist.\nJohn attended the Gilbert Rene school in the capital Lusaka. On holiday back in Britain during the mid-1950s he saw two films, The Red Balloon and Disney\u2019s Peter Pan. With no TV and little radio in Lusaka, he was spellbound. When the family returned to Yorkshire in 1965, John attended the Rose Bruford College of Speech and Drama in London.\nAfter he left, he was determined to start a theatre company in Bradford, which had no rep and no theatre provision for children and young people. Along with four friends from college and with the help of his parents, sister, Jill, and brother, Michael, John took over the family home to make costumes and create sets.\nHe persuaded local authorities to back his idea of taking theatre into schools and his project soon grew. The company performed in public areas, shopping malls, galas and festivals and took a residency at the Gateshead Metro centre. On the education side, his group of actors went into schools every day and in the holidays performed in theatres.\nOver the years John employed thousands of actors, many of whom went on to have successful careers, including Robin Herford, the director of The Woman in Black; Simon Jones, who played Ford Prefect in Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy; Joanne Good, the BBC radio presenter; and Kevin Hubbard, a television producer.\nIn 1980 John was elected to Bradford city council and four years later became its chair of education and arts. In all he served for seven years, championing diversity as well as being a driving force in the restoration of the Alhambra theatre, which re-opened in 1986.\nHe also continued to perform himself, particularly as a clown, and with his clowning partner, Ros Ottery, represented Britain in an international clowning festival in Japan in 1989.\nJohn eventually realised his long-held dream of finding a permanent home for Q20 and a community creative hub. In 2013 he obtained a machine shed in Shipley and converted it into rehearsal rooms, studios and offices. The \u201cHub\u201d has supported numerous groups including photographers, painters, film-makers, potters, a bagpipe maker and a casting director. \nJohn never retired but continued to work at the Hub.\nIn 1978 he married Jacquie Mosley, and she survives him along with their children, Benjamin and Charlotte, his stepson, Alexander, five grandchildren, William, Matilda, Solomon, Theo and Jasper, and his sister, Jill.",

I have been with England through highs and lows, from Headingley 1981 to the doldrums of the 1990s, and watched it rise again from 2005. I have admired David Gower, Ian Botham, Bob Willis, Graham Gooch and many others. As a Briton of south Asian descent, I have been filled with hope by watching Moeen Ali, Adil Rashid and many others who look and sound like me wearing an England shirt.\nI have also been stigmatised by the Tebbit test, have suffered negative treatment at all levels of English cricket, and have despaired of the lack of fairness, but through it all, my love of the game and passion for the England team has\u00a0been constant.\nNot any more, I\u2019m afraid. As the full story of the horrors suffered by Azeem Rafiq becomes clear (Azeem Rafiq tells MPs that \u2018inhuman\u2019 racist abuse cost him cricket career, 16 November) and now with other stories emerging, I fear that I may finally have to acknowledge that I cannot support this game or this team any more. It is not for the likes of me; my support is taken for granted and we receive little back from the game other than contempt. A shame, but I\u2019m afraid my patience is gone. I applaud Rafiq, a remarkable and courageous man, and wish him well. I urge English cricketers to reflect on their actions and how they wield their power and influence, and for whose benefit. At\u00a0the moment, it\u2019s not for me.Nadeem Razvi Saffron Walden, Essex\n As this week\u2019s news from the cricketing world has shown, racism and racist abuse are very much alive in our society. Being the victim of racism can obviously have long-term negative effects on mental health. But racism can be damaging even when experienced vicariously. News reports and stories on social media in themselves may be distressing and may lead to hypervigilance and heightened distress in those who socially identify with the victims.\nMany of those not directly affected by racism are quick to condemn this behaviour and to defend its victims. People overwhelmingly want to help and support those affected by racism \u2013 but not everyone knows how to\u00a0do\u00a0so effectively.\nThere is strong evidence that social support can mitigate some of the effects of racist discrimination. So-called \u201cbystander behaviours\u201d such as simply checking in with someone who may have experienced racism and offering them support are important and\u00a0effective.\nMany factors influence our willingness to help victims of racism, or to intervene when witnessing a racist incident. Research has shown that active bystander training can help. Several organisations in the UK (such as Besea.n and the Racial Justice Network) offer such\u00a0courses\u00a0free of charge. Liesbeth Tip Edinburgh\n The origins of Yorkshire County Cricket Club\u2019s difficult relationship with Asian cricketers go back well before the current management. In the 1980s, Asian constituents of mine asked me why there were no Asian cricketers on the county books when there were many good young Asian cricketers in Yorkshire.\nI raised this with Brian Walsh QC, the club chair, who said he would look into it. He came back to me to say that because Asian cricketers did not feel welcome in clubs in the top Yorkshire leagues, they had formed their own league and that the county\u2019s talent spotting system had not extended to this area of the game. This omission was rectified and young Asian cricketers began to enter the Yorkshire coaching system. Recent events suggest that underlying racist attitudes still exist and urgently need to be rectified.Michael Meadowcroft Liberal MP, Leeds West, 1983-87 \n Have an opinion on anything you\u2019ve read in the Guardian today?

        "content": "Camp Nou had a much-needed dose of fun on Wednesday as the re-signed Brazilian was unveiled before an adoring crowd\nDani Alves went up the stairs and into the light at the end of the tunnel, where he stepped past a mat positioned at the edge of the Camp Nou pitch with Johan Cruyff\u2019s most famous instruction written on it. \u201cGo out there and enjoy it,\u201d it said, as if Alves needed telling. Oh he was going to enjoy this, all right. That, after all, was what he was here for \u2013 part of the reason he had rejoined Barcelona five years later \u2013 and they couldn\u2019t have wiped the smile off his face if they had tried.\nAt the white line, Alves paused and slipped off his flip-flops \u2013 yes, flipflops \u2013 and stepped on to the pitch barefoot. He wanted to feel the grass, he said. In the stand above, 10,378 people roared and he laughed, which he did a lot. Wearing a black polo neck, a black velvet jacket and nothing on his feet, he took the microphone and, looking up at it all, cackled like Sid James. The Dani Alves show was back in town, and they were loving it. \u201cAlves! Alves! Alves!\u201d they chanted.\nHe paraded back and forth, bowed and waved and pulled faces and cracked up, an atmosphere of celebration around him. It might have been a bit silly, and it was natural to wonder whether a 38-year-old free agent who hasn\u2019t played for five months can really rescue Barcelona, especially when the club\u2019s chief executive, Mateu Alemany, admitted there was no money to sign anyone else, but maybe they need a bit of that. \u201cIn recent years they have loaded negative things on to their shoulders,\u201d Alves said. \u201cIt\u2019s time to change and you need to be positive. That\u2019s my mission here.\u201d\nAnd so it went, until he signed off with his own twist on the traditional rallying call: \u201cLong live Bar\u00e7a! Long Live Catalonia! And long live the mother that gave birth to you all!\u201d\nHe insisted \u201cI\u2019m one of you\u201d and, still barely believing this was happening, kissed the pen with which he was invited to sign his contract, table and papers prepared on the pitch. That contract starts now, although he can\u2019t play until 1 January, and runs out at the end of the season, but the 2022 World Cup is his target and Alves said that in these six months he would do what he could to convince the club to extend that deal. \u201cIf I fail, I\u2019ll pack the suitcase myself. \u2018Ciao!\u2019\u201d he said.\nThat was not all he signed or kissed. He signed the billboard with his Warhol-style image on, doing so with a smiley face, and he kissed the shirt of course. On the back was an eight, the fifth number he has worn here after two and 20, 22 in honour of Eric Abidal, and six in honour of Xavi Hern\u00e1ndez, the former teammate who is now his manager. That is a trend he said he was continuing. \u201cI believe in paying homage to people while they\u2019re still alive,\u201d he insisted, citing Hristo Stoichkov and Andr\u00e9s Iniesta and bringing another cheer, more kisses.\n\u201cThe last time I had this microphone, I said the dream wouldn\u2019t end there,\u201d he told them. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m here again.\u201d\nWhy, was the question. What could Alves offer? \u201cI might have a bit less hair but some things never change: the spirit, the fight, the soul,\u201d he said in the press room, dark glasses added to his outfit, but still no shoes. He also reckoned he was more handsome now and claimed that he had been so \u201cpesado\u201d, such a pain, constantly calling Joan Laporta and offering to play pretty much for free, that in the end the president passed him on to Xavi to get rid of him. \u201cAnd when Xavi called and said they could do with my help, I didn\u2019t want to hear anything else,\u201d Alves said.\nAs much of the focus was on the personality as it was on the player, and Alves talked about what he could do off the pitch, about \u201charmony\u201d \u201csynergy\u201d and a \u201cdressing room [that] is better with me in it\u201d, about how he could change the culture at the club, returning them to the way they were. The man who has more winner\u2019s medals than anyone else suggested \u201cthose of us with more kilometres on the clock\u201d could help the younger generation, pointedly talking up Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9. And when it came to sending footballs sailing into the upper tier, he had failed three times, giggling as the shots fell short.\nBut it didn\u2019t matter. And for all that the character is part of the charm, for all that the showmanship and nostalgia was unavoidable \u2013 asked whether Lionel Messi could come back too, Alves replied \u201cgive me a couple of hours and I\u2019ll go and get him myself\u201d \u2013 there has always been a seriousness about him, an iron competitiveness. And he insisted that has not changed. \u201cLifting cups is what\u2019s really special,\u201d he said.\nSince Alves left in 2016 Barcelona have spent \u20ac85m on right-backs, and none has adequately replaced him. \u201cI\u2019m special,\u201d he said. He was laughing but he was right, just as he was when he said that \u201csometimes here it\u2019s not enough just to be a great player\u201d. There was another glimpse of that ambition in his refusal to meekly accept the assumption that he is here to play a pastoral role, still less a secondary one. Or that his position may shift.\n\u201cI come to play as a full-back,\u201d Alves said. \u201cBut I can do other things and when you put a limit on what you can do, it reduces your chances. My focus is the team. Xavi will decide. I am training as a full-back, working to win my place. Not because of what I did before but what I do now, to earn the right to wear this shirt. Many things in life change but the desire doesn\u2019t. I\u2019m coming here to fight. I know what this club represents. If we all pull in the same direction this boat will reach the port sooner.\u201d\nAsked whether he expected to be a back-up option, he shot back: \u201cI wasn\u2019t born to be second. I\u2019m not here to pass the time, just to live in Barcelona. I\u2019m here to go to war. I\u2019m here to fight to play. Not because of my history or because I have a good relationship with the coach, the president or the club, but because of my work. Age is just a number. There are lots of older players at a very high level and that\u2019s my objective. I showed that at the Olympics. People expect the best of me and I\u2019m going to respond. I\u2019d like to thank everyone for coming here and I can guarantee I won\u2019t let them down.\u201d",

Sometimes you get a good giggle, but I don\u2019t know what the thing is with the capes, a grown man in tights. I feel like it must come from pantomime.\u201d\nIn September, Campion told the Hollywood Reporter that she would never do one because she doesn\u2019t need the money. \u201cI don\u2019t see so many people going backwards into smaller budgets once they go out and do a great big Marvel movie,\u201d she added. \u201cI think it\u2019s hard to go back into personal stories.\u201d\nCampion is the latest acclaimed director to criticise superhero films, following on Martin Scorsese, who compared them to \u201ctheme parks\u201d in 2019, and Ridley Scott, who called them \u201cfucking boring as shit\u201d earlier this month. Both Marvel and DC have tried to bring over more auteurs, most recently Chlo\u00e9 Zhao, the Oscar-winning Nomadland director who made this month\u2019s Eternals. But the film has become the Marvel Cinematic Universe\u2019s worst reviewed offering to date.\nThe Power of the Dog is the first film from Campion since 2009\u2019s Bright Star and is one of the frontrunners for next year\u2019s best picture Oscar. It stars Benedict Cumberbatch as a sexually repressed rancher who develops a strange fascination with an effete young man. The Guardian\u2019s Peter Bradshaw gave it five stars and called it one of Campion\u2019s best.",

        "content": "In the bitter aftermath of him narrowly missing the ultimate achievement in tennis two months ago, Novak Djokovic spoke openly in New York about the pressure that came with his grand slam attempt. For weeks, he said, emotions became increasingly intense and difficult to handle, weighing so heavily on his shoulders even though he has already experienced and overcome most things in the sport.\nAfter he was beaten in the US Open final in straight sets by Daniil Medvedev, in the obvious sadness and frustration one of his very first emotions was simple relief.\nDifficult losses leave a mark and can linger in any player\u2019s psyche for a while, so there was little surprise Djokovic spent the following weeks away from the court. It would not have been shocking if his efforts during this season had left a small mark on him and his motivations before a full reset in the off-season.\nBut six weeks after the US Open Djokovic went to Paris and this month won a record 37th Masters 1000 title. That he bounced back so quickly, shaking off the rust through the rounds and remaining supremely motivated at the end of yet another long season as he overcame Medvedev in the final was impressive in itself. The nature of his victory was even more notable.\nDjokovic shook their match up by deciding his route to victory was partly in the forecourt. For two hours and 15 minutes he continually flitted to the net, serve and volleying 22 times and winning 19 points on them while approaching the net 36 times.\nAs Djokovic, Medvedev and the rest of the top eight converged for the first ATP Finals in Turin, they strolled around the city last Friday for promotional photos. Djokovic stood out; not only did the 34-year-old seem ancient in a group where the next oldest players are 25, but a defining feature of the new generation is their height and athleticism. Most of them towered over Djokovic, who stands at 6ft 2in. When Djokovic first broke into the top 10, only one man, the 6ft 4in Ivan Ljubicic, was taller than him.\nPerformances like the Paris final underline how Djokovic has consistently improved and evolved his game, particularly with the growing dominance of his serve and his ever-present variety, allowing him to adjust and remain on top even in his mid-30s against far younger athletes.\nDjokovic opened his tournament in Turin by overcoming a solid first set by Casper Ruud to win 7-6 (4), 6-2. He followed it up with a dominant, succinct 6-3, 6-2 win over Andrey Rublev on Wednesday.\nThe most memorable moment of the encounter with the No 5-ranked Russian came at 2-2, deuce on Rublev\u2019s serve in the second set. Rublev had Djokovic on the ropes, pounding forehands from side to side from inside the baseline, shots that would have been winners against almost every other player.\nInstead, Djokovic dug out a slice forehand at full sprint and splits, before flitting to the other corner and landing a winning angled backhand passing shot. Completely rattled by Djokovic\u2019s defence in his first meeting with the world No 1, Rublev meekly gave away the break point with a backhand unforced error. He did not win another game.\nThroughout this season Djokovic has tidily arranged so many of his records in order and his Paris Masters run allowed him to clinch seven seasons as the year-end No 1, breaking his tie with his idol, Pete Sampras. By winning the Paris title, he also passed Rafael Nadal to become the owner of a record 37 Masters 1000 titles.\nThis is a unique season and it is not over. With his win over Rublev, Djokovic\u2019s record in Turin is now 4-0 in sets and he is already into the semi-finals. He will have the benefit of facing Cameron Norrie on Friday with no stress at all as he waits to see if anyone can meet his level at the top.\nLater on Wednesday, Norrie started brilliantly against Casper Ruud, the eighth seed, before he was gradually worn down by the tenacious Norwegian, who won 1-6, 6-3, 6-4 in just under two hours. Ruud will face Rublev on Friday, with the winner joining Djokovic in the semi-final from the Green Group. Norrie, the second alternate, was drafted in to the ATP Finals after the withdrawal of Stefanos Tsitsipas due to an elbow injury.",

Senior posts in economic development with other Welsh public bodies followed and in 2006 Gren joined the civil service in Wales.\nI met Gren the following year when I joined the Welsh government as director of skills, higher education and lifelong learning. He was a member of my senior management team and led the division that provided support to industry bodies and employers to help them meet their training and development needs. He was charismatic, energetic, a great networker and passionate about the ways in which education and skills can contribute to business development.\nGren\u2019s talents were amply demonstrated when the economic crisis began to bite in 2007-08. The Welsh government saw an urgent need to help businesses cope with the recession and to protect jobs. Gren\u2019s team developed and obtained significant EU funding for the ProAct programme, which enabled employees who had been placed on short-time working to learn new skills, and provided wage subsidy support to help retain skilled staff who might otherwise be made redundant.\nThe independent review of ProAct in 2011 praised its innovative approach and estimated that it had safeguarded more than 1,800 jobs, adding far more value to the Welsh economy than it had cost to run. Gren and his team had the satisfaction of seeing ProAct\u2019s impact described in the New York Times in an article on job-saving schemes in the EU.\nGren was born in Nottingham, the son of Eddie and Florrie Jackson, both factory workers, and went to High Pavement grammar school. He studied urban and regional planning at Oxford Polytechnic before joining Lanarkshire county council as a planning officer. Later he completed an MA in regional economics at Lancaster University and then took up a regional planning post at Greater Manchester council.\nGren retired from the civil service in 2011; he was made OBE the following year for his distinguished public service for Wales.\nFor more than 40 years Gren and his wife, Anne-Marie, lived in Bishop\u2019s Castle in Shropshire, close to the Welsh border. He was active in local organisations such as the local Labour party, health board and tennis club, and was a trustee of the AQA Examination Board for nine years. He drove many miles in support of his home-town football team, Nottingham Forest, hoping in vain to see them return to their place at the top of English football.\nGren is survived by Anne-Marie, whom he met as a student on the planning course at Oxford Polytechnic and married in 1972, and by their sons, Rory and Corin, and grandchildren, Leila and Seth.",

He was a scintillating lecturer and exigent tutor, fearlessly and ingeniously defending individual conscience and the rationality of faith. To his pastoral work he brought remarkably clear thinking, a warm heart and a delightful unworldliness.\nBorn in Surrey, one of three children of Margaret (nee Barry), a primary head, and Henry Hughes, a marine engineer, Gerry was educated at St Aloysius\u2019 College, Glasgow, from which he entered the Society of Jesus in 1951. In addition to the usual Jesuit studies in philosophy and theology, he took firsts in mods and greats at Oxford and wrote a fine thesis on Aristotelian moral responsibility under Charles Stevenson at Michigan. Notable among his books are The Nature of God (1995) and Aristotle on Ethics (2001).\nMoral objectivity was a subject to which he returned in articles written throughout his career. He argued that the right thing to do, once discovered, possesses an authority that cannot be seriously dented by collisions with either personal moral weakness or the resistances of the culture.\nGerry personified the practical wisdom of Aristotle\u2019s Nicomachean Ethics. His arguments were careful and his conclusions full of good sense, and he was passionate in manner and prudent in judgment. Faithful friendship came naturally to him. What he said and did was thought through, his teaching and example enhancing his students\u2019 vision of goodness.\nIn addition to his religion, music enchanted him. Gerry sang well and enjoyed, above all, Bach. The musical architecture of the Leipzig Passions fascinated him, as a person whose own apprehension of the central truths of Christianity was rational, exuberant and intricately harmonious with traditional faith.\nHe played a full part in Jesuit life and was often a superior, and always a kind and conscientious trainer of younger members. He was an influential member of the 1974 General Congregation, which made significant changes to the life of the Society of Jesus.\nThe title of his book Fidelity Without Fundamentalism (2010) sums up his attitude to church affairs. Progressive and a little impatient with the slow pace of reform, Gerry was nonetheless devotedly protective of the spiritual inheritance he had received; he understood it thoroughly and lived it with complete integrity.\nGerry\u2019s sister, Clare, and brother, Brian, predeceased him. He is survived by his sister-in-law, Cora, and three nieces and one nephew.",

A court date is expected on Thursday.\n\u201cThis points to the truth that law enforcement over history has often failed to live up to its responsibilities,\u201d the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus Vance Jr, told the New York Times, which first reported the news. \u201cThese men did not get the justice that they deserved.\u201d\nOne of the civil rights era\u2019s most polemical yet inspiring figures, Malcolm X rose to fame while advocating Black power as the Nation of Islam\u2019s chief spokesperson. He famously urged Black people to claim civil rights \u201cby any means necessary\u201d.\nThe revered leader was gunned down as he began a speech in Harlem\u2019s Audubon Ballroom on 21 February 1965. He had left the Nation of Islam a year earlier, and had conceived of a new project, the Organization of Afro-American Unity.\nA Netflix documentary miniseries, Who Killed Malcolm X? reignited interest in the historic case last year, rekindling suspicions that the US justice system had targeted the wrong men.\nAziz, Islam and a third man, Mujahid Abdul Halim \u2013 known at the time of the killing as Talmadge Hayer and later as Thomas Hagan \u2013 were convicted of murder in March 1966 and sentenced to life in prison.\nHalim confessed that he was one of three gunmen who attacked Malcolm X, but he testified that neither Aziz nor Islam were involved. They also maintained their innocence.\nDecades later, the men\u2019s lawyers, the Innocence Project and the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office have pieced together the crime, although there are few living witnesses or potential suspects, and documents and physical evidence are largely unavailable.\nEven with those hurdles, they found enough to conclude that a new jury very well might have acquitted the two men. The investigation uncovered a living witness who supported Aziz\u2019s alibi that he had been at home the day of the assassination, FBI documents about other suspects, and more.\n\u201cThis wasn\u2019t a mere oversight,\u201d lawyer Deborah Francois told the Times. \u201cThis was a product of extreme and gross official misconduct.\u201d\nAziz, who was called Norman 3X Butler at the time of the shooting, was released in 1985. He is now 83 years old. Islam, formerly Thomas 15X Johnson, was released two years later and died in 2009.\nThe two collectively spent years in solitary confinement, according to the Times. They languished behind bars at some of New York\u2019s most infamous maximum-security prisons. Both had children when they were locked away, and their marriages crumbled.\n\u201cIt affected them in every way you could possibly imagine,\u201d said civil rights lawyer David Shanies. \u201cThem and their families.\u201d\nAssociated Press contributed to this report",

        "content": "Exclusive: Richard Vautrey says minister and media have made public think GPs are hiding away from patients\nSajid Javid\u2019s criticisms of how GPs work have fuelled a rise in verbal and physical attacks on them and their staff, the leader of Britain\u2019s family doctors has claimed.\nDr Richard Vautrey said comments by the health secretary and NHS bosses, alongside negative coverage of GPs in some newspapers, had wrongly made the public think they were \u201chiding away\u201d from patients, and exposed staff to abuse.\nVautrey, the outgoing chair of the British Medical Association\u2019s GPs committee, made the claim in an interview with the Guardian before the union\u2019s decision on Thursday about whether to press ahead with industrial action in protest at a government edict that GPs in England must see any patient face to face if requested.\nBefore the pandemic 80% of consultations in England were face-to-face. That fell dramatically on government and NHS orders when the Covid pandemic struck, though in recent months it has risen again to 60%.\nVautrey said: \u201cWe\u2019ve gone from the clapping and support of the general public to the huge criticisms of, and unacceptable abuse that\u2019s been levelled at, GPs and their teams both from certain sections of the media but also fuelled by government comments and NHS England comments, which have been completely unacceptable.\n\u201cBoth the secretary of state and NHS England overtly supported the campaigning of some sections of the media. And that then fuelled the anti-GP rhetoric, not just nationally, but also locally.\n\u201cOur reception staff particularly have been on the end of almost daily abuse from individuals calling them, understandably frustrated that they\u2019re waiting for an appointment or waiting for a procedure, and [have] not been able to get exactly what they want. But nevertheless that national tone has then led to our practices being under fire.\u201d\nHe added that individuals had been \u201csubjected to physical abuse as well as verbal abuse \u2013 this is unacceptable and yet we\u2019ve not seen the government call that out and take it seriously\u201d. There have been \u201csome horrendous examples\u201d in recent weeks including one in which a GP\u2019s skull was fractured.\nLast month the BMA\u2019s GPs committee voted unanimously to reject a plan by Javid which included \u201cnaming and shaming\u201d surgeries that see too few patients in person, and hold a ballot on possible industrial action, which could result in family doctors at the 6,600 practices in England reducing the work they undertake.\nHowever, Vautrey stressed that doctors would keep seeing patients. \u201cGPs are on the side of their patients \u2026 None of the [four types of protest action proposed in the indicative ballot] would have an impact on patient care. GPs do not do anything that would put their patients at risk. This is all about getting the government to listen to the needs of GPs, practice nurses and practice managers,\u201d he said.\nIn his only interview since announcing he will stand down this week, Vautrey, a GP in Leeds, also:\nCalled ministers \u201chypocritical\u201d for encouraging GP surgeries to offer virtual appointments by phone or video call in the years before and during the pandemic but now mandating in-person consultations.\nClaimed Javid had torn up the standard practice of the Department of Health and BMA negotiating changes to GPs\u2019 working practices. \u201cThere were no negotiations. We were presented with a fait accompli. We were ignored.\u201d\nAttacked NHS England for helping Javid draw up and then publish his plan to expand face-to-face appointments, which has sparked fury among GPs, saying: \u201cThey\u2019re equally complicit in this.\u201d\nHe accused the government of trying to shift the blame for the NHS\u2019s growing problems on to GPs to deflect attention from its own failed stewardship of the health service. \u201cThere\u2019s been attempts to distract from the almost weekly headlines now [showing] the pressure that the NHS is under. And so often it\u2019s GPs who are blamed for that, completely wrongly. It\u2019s distracting from their failings.\n\u201cGPs are being blamed for things which are out of their control. We need proper support, additional staff and better premises. The government aren\u2019t showing signs of addressing that properly and yet are all too quick to blame GPs for failings which are theirs, not the profession\u2019s.\u201d\nReferring to the health secretary\u2019s five months in the post, Vautrey said Javid had been too focused on hospitals and the NHS backlog and not enough on helping GPs, many of whom are quitting or going part-time in response to heavy workloads.\n\u201cHe\u2019s so far proved too quick to support the populist media and far too slow to support the profession. Sajid Javid still doesn\u2019t understand the nature of general practice in the way that he has to,\u201d Vautrey said.\nJavid told MPs this month that patients were adding to the overload at A&E units because they could not get a GP appointment, saying: \u201cA significant portion of people are turning up for emergency care when they could have actually gone to their GP. Part of the reason that I think people are turning up at A&E, perhaps when they do not need it, is that they are not able to get through to their primary care services in the usual way.\u201d\nLast week the Royal College of GPs (RCGP) wrote to Javid disputing that and asking him to provide evidence. NHS Providers, which represents hospital trusts in England, backed the RCGP.\nVautrey also warned that a rise in face-to-face appointments could put patients in danger of catching Covid in waiting rooms. \u201cIt is irresponsible for the government to suggest to patients that we can return to a situation that was the case pre-pandemic where we had crowded waiting rooms. We can\u2019t go back to that sort of situation when we\u2019ve got Covid rates at the levels we have at the moment. For anyone to suggest that is potentially putting patients and our staff at risk.\u201d\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \u201cThis government takes a zero-tolerance approach to violence and abuse whenever it arises and it is completely wrong to imply ministers would do anything but support GPs. The last 18 months have been extremely challenging and we\u2019re incredibly grateful for the phenomenal work of our NHS staff including GPs and their teams. Practices have been open and busy throughout the pandemic, offering both in-person and remote consultations.\n\u201cWe know that general practice is busy and demand for services is high, that is why we have set out a plan to provide targeted support to help them continue to improve access \u2013 backed by a \u00a3250m winter access fund.\u201d",

        "content": "Vote advocating that those who prioritise outside roles be \u2018appropriately punished\u2019 passes\nMPs have backed a move that could curb their ability to take other jobs, as Boris Johnson sought to neutralise criticism that he had been soft on backbenchers\u2019 outside interests.\nKeir Starmer had planned to use an opposition-led debate in parliament to table a motion suggesting MPs be banned from taking any paid work as a parliamentary strategist, adviser or consultant.\nBut Johnson wanted to look as if he was going further than the Labour leader. He proposed an amendment that said MPs who prioritise other paid roles over serving their constituents should also be investigated and \u201cappropriately punished\u201d. However, there was frustration that it said nothing about how it would be determined if an MP was spending too much time doing another job and was branded a \u201cwrecking amendment\u201d by Labour.\nLabour\u2019s initial motion was defeated by 231 votes to 282, but it and other opposition parties did not oppose the government\u2019s amendment, meaning it passed by 297 votes to 0.\nIt means the standards committee, which reviews the MPs\u2019 code of conduct, will need to consider the result and announce recommendations to update the code by next February.\nThe vote comes after weeks of scrutiny on MPs\u2019 outside financial interests, including Owen Paterson\u2019s \u201cegregious\u201d breach of lobbying rules and the revelation that Geoffrey Cox had collected nearly \u00a36m from legal work, appeared to use his Commons office to attend a virtual hearing, and voted by proxy from the British Virgin Islands.\nDespite the result on Wednesday night, many MPs \u2013 including some Conservatives \u2013 felt it was a pointless exercise, given the standards committee is already reviewing the code.\nThe committee\u2019s chair, Chris Bryant, said people were trying to bounce it in to doing something it was already in the process of, and acting like \u201cheadless chickens\u201d. He said:\n\u201cThe committee has been engaged in an evidence based review of the code of conduct for more than a year and is close to completing its work which we hope to do before Christmas or even before the end of the month.\u201d Bryant added the draft proposals would be consulted on, with final recommendations made early next year \u2013 though stressed the government would need to table a motion to implement them.\nA minister told the Guardian it was \u201ccontrary to natural justice\u201d to dictate how MPs could use their spare time and said Johnson\u2019s amendment was a \u201cbollocks\u201d plan that could be \u201ccompletely insignificant\u201d because the interpretation of too much time on another role might end up being so loose that barely anyone would be affected.\nA former minister revealed they had put other roles \u201con ice\u201d while waiting for clarity, and was exasperated at cabinet minister Anne-Marie Trevelyan suggesting in three separate interviews on Wednesday that the number of hours worked a week in other jobs should be capped at 10, then 15, then 20.\nDuring the debate, Labour accused ministers of putting parliament and democracy \u201cinto disrepute\u201d by \u201cripping up a 30-year consensus on how we enforce standards in this place\u201d.\nThangam Debbonaire, the shadow Commons leader, accused Johnson of tabling a \u201cwrecking amendment\u201d and said it would only \u201cwater down\u201d genuine attempts to crack down on MPs\u2019 second jobs. \u201cIt will be yet more warm words but no action,\u201d she added.\nHowever, Jacob Rees-Mogg, her opposite number in government, said it was \u201can historic strength of our system, that MPs should have a wider focus than the Westminster bubble\u201d.\nHe insisted an MP\u2019s job serving their constituents should take \u201csupremacy\u201d, but believed they should \u201cmaintain connections to the world beyond so that we may draw on the insight and expertise that this experience offers\u201d.\nSome Conservatives raised concerns. Nigel Mills said change had been needed \u201cfor a long while\u201d but that the government should be \u201ccareful that we get this right\u201d. He warned that people would expect \u201cdue consideration\u201d of the issue and that \u201cfair, consistent and enforceable\u201d rules were brought in which \u201cdon\u2019t just leave crazy loopholes\u201d.\nMark Fletcher, a Tory MP who sits on the standards committee, said people should be \u201cworking with [it], rather than instructing it\u201d. He added it was \u201cfar from clear\u201d how it should be decided whether an outside job was \u201cwithin reasonable limits\u201d.\nAnd Charles Walker, a Tory MP, hit out at accusations that parliament was a \u201ccesspit and full of crooks and rogues\u201d. He said: \u201cWe\u2019ve all suffered from this. I\u2019m not voting for any motion, a plague is deserved on all of our houses.\u201d",

But on Wednesday, while MPs at Westminster were focused on the scandal over MPs\u2019 second jobs, the Department of Health and Social Care said only private contributions would be counted.\nThat means that a pensioner with a \u00a390,000 home in Burnley who qualifies for council help could pay the same for their care out of their own pocket as someone with property worth \u00a3250,000 or more in Surrey who is too wealthy for means-tested assistance. Care bills could still eat into almost all of their assets, forcing the sale of the house.\nLabour said the government had \u201cfailed to be straight\u201d with elderly people and described the care costs cap as a \u201ccon\u201d. It said the announcement was \u201csneaked out today under a cloud of Tory sleaze\u201d.\nThe decision also goes against the recommendations of Sir Andrew Dilnot, the economist who devised the cap proposals and has previously described the approach now being taken by ministers as \u201cunfair for those on low incomes\u201d. Dilnot is preparing to give evidence to MPs on social care reform on Thursday.\nTorsten Bell, director of the Resolution Foundation thinktank, said: \u201cif you own a \u00a31m house in the home counties, over 90% of your assets are protected. If you\u2019ve got a terrace house in Hartlepool worth \u00a370,000 you can lose almost everything.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cI\u2019m really not sure the government\u2019s thought this through. They might not actually win the vote \u2013 Conservative MPs in [the] north and Midlands have just been told the cap on care costs will do far less for their constituents who could still lose almost everything.\u201d\nThe DHSC defended the change and insisted it \u201cwill mean everyone is better off\u201d. \u201cCompared to the current system more people will be supported with their social care costs, have greater certainty over what they need to pay and receive higher quality care,\u201d a spokesperson said.\nAnalysts said the move could save the government hundreds of millions of pounds from the estimated \u00a33bn cost of the cap, but the savings were being taken from people with low to moderate wealth not richer people.\n\u201cThese changes will mean that the people who need the most protection from catastrophically high care costs \u2013 those with low to moderate levels of wealth \u2013 will get less protection than wealthier people,\u201d said Sally Warren, director of policy at the King\u2019s Fund thinktank.\n\u201cThey may well wonder why the prime minister\u2019s promise that no one need sell their house to pay for care will benefit wealthier people but doesn\u2019t seem to apply to them. The government was brave in raising taxes to fund the long-overdue reform of social care but, having taken two steps forward, has now taken one step back.\u201d\nAt any one time, tens of thousands of people receiving care have such limited assets that they get means-tested help and so will be affected directly by the proposals. Hundreds of thousands of people who may never need social care will nevertheless be worried about being caught by the new system if they eventually require help. It effectively means some people with lesser assets don\u2019t benefit from the cap at all.\n\u201cThe proposed amendments to the Care Act mean reforms will no longer protect those with lower wealth from catastrophic costs,\u201d said Charles Tallack at the Health Foundation thinktank. \u201cThe changes seem motivated by the desire to save money but do so by taking protection away from poorer homeowners.\u201d\nWarren also said that people who will lose out the most are in the former red wall seats. \u201cAverage house prices in these constituencies is \u00a3160,000 compared to \u00a3270,000 in traditional Conservative seats,\u201d she said. \u201cThe median house price in Hartlepool \u2013 the last red wall seat to fall \u2013 is \u00a3128,000.\u201d\nIn September the government announced a 1.25% rise in national insurance, dubbed the health and social care levy, part of which is to be used to fund the social care cap. Johnson acknowledged the \u201canxiety that affects millions of people up and down the country, the fear that a condition like dementia, one of nature\u2019s bolts from the blue could lead to the total liquidation of their assets, their lifetime savings, their home \u2013 the loss of everything that they might otherwise pass on to their children\u201d.\nThe new approach will require amending the Care Act with parliamentary approval. The government said in an update published online that the \u201cmuch more generous means test is the main means of helping people with lower levels of assets\u201d.\nThe point at which people become eligible to receive some financial support from their local authority will rise to assets worth \u00a3100,000 from the current \u00a323,250. Anyone with assets between \u00a320,000 and \u00a3100,000 will be eligible for some means-tested support.\nLiz Kendall, the shadow social care minister, said the change \u201cshows Boris Johnson\u2019s so-called cap on care costs is an even bigger con than we initially thought. We already knew most people won\u2019t hit the cap because it doesn\u2019t cover board and lodging in care homes, and that at \u00a386,000 the cap would still mean many people will have to sell their homes to pay for their care \u2013 against everything Boris Johnson promised.\n\u201cIt has now been revealed that the poorest pensioners will have to pay even more, something Andrew Dilnot \u2013 who proposed the cap \u2013 explicitly ruled out because it was so unfair. That this Tory government has failed to be straight with those who\u2019ve given so much to our country is a total disgrace, but utterly unsurprising. Our elderly people deserve better.\u201d",

The striker Vivianne Miedema added a third late on as the Gunners moved one step closer to a place in the Champions League quarter-finals. Arsenal need one point from their remaining two games, against Barcelona and Hoffenheim, to finish second in the group ahead of the German side.\nIf the 5-1 win in Denmark last week had suggested this would be a breeze then Arsenal\u2019s 1-1 draw with Tottenham on Saturday and the \u201csignificant\u201d hamstring injury to Williamson ensured the Gunners\u2019 momentum was not quite as sure as it had been.\nThe draw was Arsenal\u2019s first slip-up in the Women\u2019s Super League. Rehanne Skinner\u2019s impressively organised Spurs side have perhaps offered a blueprint for keeping the Gunners at bay, with a powerful header from Miedema in added time the only goal for a team that had scored three or more goals in every other league fixture so far.\nDespite a foray forward by the Danish side in the first minute, urged on by an impressive and vocal travelling contingent, Arsenal quickly took control of the pace of play. The decision to start with Miedema on the bench perhaps suggested Arsenal\u2019s manager Jonas Eidevall was not perturbed by the inability of his side to get the better of Spurs, despite their dominance.\nFoord, leading the line in place of Miedema, had her cleanest chance 15 minutes in when she was played through but K\u00f8ge goalkeeper Kaylan Marckese was quick to come out and smother the shot. One minute later the Australian forward side-footed Beth Mead\u2019s cross in at the near post to put Arsenal ahead.\nThe back five and midfield four of the Danish champions were effective and afforded their forward some bright moments on the break but the final pass or shot always let them down. With the margin narrow there was little room for complacency, with K\u00f8ge\u2019s only Champions League goal having been scored against the Gunners in Denmark.\nA triple change on the hour mark saw Miedema, the defensive midfielder Frida Maanum and the left-back Steph Catley introduced to energise the home attack. The home team were almost punished for their profligacy, but a reaction save from the goalkeeper Lydia Williams denied Maddie Pokorny before Wubben-Moy sealed the win when she headed powerfully in from Jordan Nobbs\u2019 corner before Miedema added the third.\n\u201cWhat was great today was that we were able to change [their danger on the counter] during the game,\u201d said Eidevall. \u201cWe positioned ourselves smarter, moved the ball better and gave far less opportunities for them. At 1-0 you can never relax. It was nice when Lotte scored the second, it\u2019s not often we concede two goals in a game so that felt a lot better.\u201d",

The inquest has run for three years.\nThe ban passed unanimously with the full support of the Labor opposition and makes the use of spit hoods on both adults and children a criminal offence within the state. South Australia is the first state to officially enact such a ban.\nLabor MP Lee Odenwalder said the ban was a \u201clong time coming\u201d and apologised to the family for the delay in action.\n\u201cI want to apologise to Latoya and the family of Wayne Fella Morrison for how long this bill has taken, since the conclusion by all parties it seems earlier this year that this was the right path to go down,\u201d he said.\nRule said they were \u201coverjoyed\u201d at the result.\n\u201cI felt bitter at the lack of action over such a long time. Today, to receive that apology from Lee on behalf of the Labor party. It means so much,\u201d Rule said.\n\u201cI actually feel like they care and that history has literally been made. Something beautiful can be made out of something devastating.\u201d\nBonaros said it was a \u201ctravesty\u201d the family was still waiting for the coronial investigation into Morrison\u2019s death to conclude, but the ban marked a \u201chistoric\u201d first step towards justice.\n\u201cThe parliament\u2019s done its work today on this very important issue and I couldn\u2019t be more proud,\u201d Bonaros said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m exceptionally grateful to the Morrison family for entrusting me with the carriage of this through the parliament.\u201d\nBefore the final vote South Australian attorney general, Vickie Chapman, noted spit hoods have not been used in the state\u2019s prisons since September.\n\u201cThis bill puts beyond doubt our commitment to cease the use of spit hoods,\u201d Chapman said.\nOdenwalder paid tribute to Morrison\u2019s family.\n\u201cI want to publicly acknowledge and thank and pay tribute to the family of the late Wayne Fella Morrison and in particular Latoya Rule.\u201d\n\u201cShe, it is fair to say, has turned adversity and tragedy into something positive, into advocacy and something that actually changes the world for people like the late Wayne Fella Morrison.\u201d\nThe family say they will continue campaigning for a national ban on the use of the spit hoods in any correctional facility anywhere in the country.",

Downhill, the sound of chainsaws has stopped after the felling of ash with dieback. Above Radland\u2019s overgrown market gardens, puddles along the lane reflect a crisscross of bare branches, and downslope, the millstream rushes with water that rises beneath Viverdon Down. Laurel shrouds the ruins of the miller\u2019s house (home of ancestors in the 19th century); the mill itself is now a dwelling, and the little outhouse, with internal niches for straw bee skeps, remains intact.\nBeneath Nanie Rowe\u2019s Wood, the sunken way is carpeted with orange beech leaves, and the stream is augmented with yet more water from Callington and the mining district of Kit Hill and Hingston Down. The water races beneath the regenerating woodland of former steep strawberry gardens, under Boars Bridge and towards the ruined weir of the National Trust\u2019s Cotehele Mill. The weir washed away last winter during flooding, and now awaits extensive reconstruction before restoration of the hydroelectric generator and historic water wheel.

        "content": "The head of the Women\u2019s Tennis Association (WTA) has said he is now even more concerned for the welfare of Peng Shuai after Chinese state media published a letter purportedly from the Chinese player.\nPeng, a former world doubles No 1, has not been heard from publicly since she alleged on social media that a former vice-premier of China, Zhang Gaoli, had sexually assaulted her.\nThe 2 November post on China\u2019s Twitter-like Weibo was removed within half an hour and censors blocked numerous related terms including \u201ctennis\u201d, but the claims still went viral. There has since been mounting concern for Peng\u2019s welfare, with Naomi Osaka among tennis stars and others calling for answers.\nEarlier this month, the WTA issued a statement calling on the Chinese government to investigate allegations made by Peng. WTA chairman and chief executive Steve Simon later said he had received \u201cassurances\u201d from China that she was safe but no one from the WTA was able to contact her to confirm.\nOn Wednesday China\u2019s state-run English-language outlet, the China Global Television Network, published a letter on Twitter which it claimed was sent from Peng to Simon.\nGarbi\u00f1e Muguruza held off Anett Kontaveit 6-3 7-5 to add the 2021 WTA Finals title to her previous wins at Wimbledon and the French Open.\nMuguruza (pictured), who ends the year as the world No 3, had already beaten Kontaveit in the group stages and it was the Spaniard who prevailed again for her 10th career WTA singles title.\nKontaveit went behind in the third game but broke back immediately to level the set at 2-2 \u2013 but Muguruza took the last four games of the set to win it in 43 minutes. The Estonian led 5-3 in the second, but her opponent found another surge to take the title.\n'I think it's a very good season overall. I think it's the year that I've won the most titles,' Muguruza said afterwards. 'I might not have won a Grand Slam, but I feel like I've been happier and more stable.'\n\u201cRegarding the recent news released on the official website of the WTA, the content has not been confirmed or verified by myself and it was released without my consent,\u201d the letter said.\n\u201cThe news in that release, including the allegation of sexual assault, is not true. I\u2019m not missing, nor I am unsafe. I\u2019ve just been resting at home and everything is fine. Thank you again for caring about me.\u201d\nIt also requested that the WTA verify any future statements with her and seek her consent before publishing. The screenshot of the letter, which included a visible cursor in the text and was not published anywhere inside China, prompted skepticism.\n\u201cThe statement released today by Chinese state media concerning Peng Shuai only raises my concerns as to her safety and whereabouts,\u201d said Simon. \u201cI have a hard time believing that Peng Shuai actually wrote the email we received or believes what is being attributed to her.\u201d\nThe advocacy group, Chinese Human Rights Defenders (CHRD), said the statement \u201cshould not be taken at face value\u201d.\n\u201cThe Chinese government has a long history of arbitrarily detaining people involved in controversial cases, controlling their ability to speak freely, and making them give forced statements,\u201d said William Nee, CHRD\u2019s research and advocacy coordinator. \u201cUntil Peng Shuai is free, the burden of proof should be on the Chinese government to prove she is not detained.\u201d\nSimon has previously suggested China\u2019s lack of action on the case could jeopardise future tours in China, saying the organisation was only interested in \u201cdoing what\u2019s right\u201d.\n\u201cPeng Shuai displayed incredible courage in describing an allegation of sexual assault against a former top official in the Chinese government. The WTA and the rest of the world need independent and verifiable proof that she is safe,\u201d he said on Wednesday.\n\u201cI have repeatedly tried to reach her via numerous forms of communications, to no avail. Peng Shuai must be allowed to speak freely, without coercion or intimidation from any source.\n\u201cHer allegation of sexual assault must be respected, investigated with full transparency and without censorship. The voices of women need to be heard and respected, not censored nor dictated to.\u201d",

        "content": "At least 6,097 deaths occurred across four home nations in 2020-21 after overcrowding hampered treatment\nThousands of patients a year are dying because of overcrowding in A&E units in Britain, and more fatalities will follow this winter, emergency care doctors claim.\nAn estimated 4,519 people in England died in 2020-21 as a direct result of people receiving less than ideal care while delayed in A&E waiting to start treatment in the hospital.\n\u201cTo say this figure is shocking is an understatement. Quite simply, crowding kills,\u201d said Dr Adrian Boyle, a vice-president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine (RCEM).\nThere have also been 709 deaths in Wales and 303 in Scotland so far this year for the same reason, according to a report by the college. Another 566 excess deaths caused by overcrowding occurred in Northern Ireland in 2020-21. The 4,519 in England \u201cmay be an underestimate\u201d, it adds.\nThe four figures taken together mean the college has identified at least 6,097 deaths across the four home nations that it believes occurred because overcrowding hampered the person\u2019s treatment.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of human misery behind these figures. It\u2019s uncomfortable and unbearable that people are being put through this. It\u2019s impossible not to feel upset and angry about this,\u201d Boyle said.\nThe RCEM\u2019s findings come days after the Association of Ambulance Chief Executives (AACE) disclosed that patients in England are dying in the back of ambulances, in hospital and also in their homes because there are too few ambulances to answer 999 calls.\nAACE also found that 160,000 people a year were coming to harm, of whom 12,000 experienced \u201csevere harm\u201d, because so many ambulances were tied up outside hospitals because A&E staff were too busy to accept the patients paramedics were looking after into their care.\nThe RCEM\u2019s report found that: \u201cCrowded emergency departments (EDs) delay and dilute the quality of care and while this may not have an immediate effect on the patient, it increases a patient\u2019s risk of death after they have left the ED.\u201d\nReferring to the death toll, the report added: \u201cThese numbers compare unfavourably with the number of deaths caused in road traffic collisions: 1,827 across the UK in 2019.\u201d\nMatthew Taylor, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said: \u201cOvercrowding in emergency departments is not merely inconveniencing patients during their visits to hospital, it\u2019s costing thousands of lives.\n\u201cThis report again shows why healthcare leaders are sounding the alarm, with the health service now under critical and unsustainable pressure.\u201d\nBoyle demanded immediate action by ministers and NHS leaders to reduce deaths by tackling overcrowding.\n\u201cThe situation is unacceptable, unsustainable and unsafe for patients and staff. Political and health leaders must realise that if performance continues to fall this winter more and more patients will come to avoidable harm in the emergency department.\u201d\nThe RCEM highlights that the government\u2019s Getting It Right First Time programme, which aims to improve quality of care, has found a patient\u2019s risk of dying rises the longer they spend in an A&E.\nA&E doctors have warned that hospitals are becoming dangerously full because of Covid and their inability to discharge patients who are medically fit to leave, which leads to a severe logjam in A&E.\nIn England in October 7,059 people \u2013 the highest number on record \u2013 had to spend at least 12 hours on a trolley or chair in a hospital corridor waiting to get a bed after A&E staff decided to admit them.",

        "content": "High court ruled in secret hearing in September that Philip\u2019s will should be hidden from public for 90 years\nLegal action against the attorney general and the Queen\u2019s private lawyers has been initiated over a decision to ban media organisations from a court hearing about the Duke of Edinburgh\u2019s will.\nThe Guardian is seeking permission to argue that the high court\u2019s failure to properly consider whether the press should be allowed to attend the hearing or make representations constitutes such a serious interference with the principle of open justice that the case should be reheard.\nIn September the president of the family division of the high court, Sir Andrew McFarlane, ruled that the will of Prince Philip should be hidden from the public for 90 years, after a secret hearing that media organisations were not told about and were barred from attending.\nThe only parties permitted to attend the court were Philip\u2019s executor, Farrer and Co Trust Corporation, a subsidiary of the Queen\u2019s private solicitors Farrer and Co, and the attorney general, Michael Ellis. Both parties successfully persuaded the judge to exclude the media from the hearing.\nMcFarlane said he \u201caccepted the argument that only the attorney general can speak, as a matter of public law, to the public interest, and that there was, legally, therefore no role for those who might represent the media at a hearing (public or private) in putting forward any contrary view of the public interest\u201d.\nUnder British law, when a person dies any will they have left behind is automatically made public. That is done in order to ensure the will is acted upon, to bring it to the attention of potential beneficiaries, and to prevent fraud against a person\u2019s estate.\nThe Windsor family is exempt from this requirement. Although the monarch\u2019s will is hidden from the public by law, there is no statute passed by parliament requiring the wills of other members of the royal family to be hidden. There is also no established legal definition of who is, and who is not, a member of the royal family. However, about 100 years ago the royal family began making legal applications to have their wills hidden from the public.\nIn the judgment summarising the closed court case relating to Prince Philip\u2019s will, McFarlane identified the first will to be kept secret as that of Prince Francis of Teck, the younger brother of Queen Mary, who died in 1910.\nTeck\u2019s will was kept secret in order to hush up a sex scandal. Mary persuaded a judge to keep it closed as it is understood to have shown that he had bequeathed prized family jewels to a mistress.\nMcFarlane wrote: \u201cThe answer to the question \u2018why should there be an exception for senior members of the royal family?\u2019 is, in my view, clear: it is necessary to enhance the protection afforded to the private lives of this unique group of individuals, in order to protect the dignity and standing of the public role of the sovereign and other close members of her family.\n\u201cWhile there may be public curiosity as to the private arrangements that a member of the royal family may choose to make in their will, there is no true public interest in the public knowing this wholly private information \u2026 The media interest in this respect is commercial.\u201d\nThe practice of sealing the Windsor family\u2019s wills from the public was last considered in 2007 when an accountant, Robert Brown, sought access to the wills of the Queen Mother and Princess Margaret on the basis that he believed they would provide evidence that he was the illegitimate child of Margaret.\nHis application was rejected. However, he successfully argued that the family court had failed to consider matters of public importance relating to the practice of sealing the Windsor family\u2019s wills away from public scrutiny.\nBrown\u2019s case also successfully uncovered the existence of a secret agreement between the attorney general, the former president of the family court, the royal household and Farrer and Co. The document was later partially disclosed.",

        "content": "MSF rescue 99 survivors who spent 13 hours on vessel trying to reach Europe as authorities accused of ignoring distress call\nTen people were found dead in the lower deck of a severely overcrowded wooden boat off the coast of Libya, Doctors Without Borders (MSF) has reported.\nAccording to survivors, those who died on Tuesday suffocated after 13 hours on the cramped lower deck, where there had been a strong smell of fuel.\nIn a difficult operation, less than 30 nautical miles from Libyan shores, the MSF team onboard the charity\u2019s chartered search and rescue vessel Geo Barents reached the boat carrying more than 100 asylum seekers attempting to reach Europe. Survivors told rescuers that there were people crammed on the lower deck who were unresponsive.\nAfter 99 people, all showing signs of acute stress and trauma, were brought on board the Geo Barents, the rescue team found 10 dead bodies at the bottom of the boat.\n\u201cIt took us almost two hours to retrieve them and to bring them on board, so they can have a dignified burial once arrived onshore,\u201d said Fulvia Conte, MSF deputy search and rescue team leader on the Geo Barents. \u201cIt was horrific and infuriating at the same time. This is another tragedy at sea that could have been avoided.\u201d\nAbdoulaye, one of the last survivors to leave the boat, barely had the time to understand what had happened to his fellow travellers before the MSF rescuers took his arm and helped him into the rescue lifeboat.\n\u201cLet me see their bodies,\u201d he told the team. \u201cThese are my brothers. We come from the same place, we went through Libya together. I need to tell their families they are dead. Please let me see them.\u201d\nSome had to identify the body of a younger brother or friend who had died in front of them a few hours earlier.\nThe volunteer-run Mediterranean rescue hotline Alarm Phone accused the European authorities of ignoring the distress call: \u201cWe had raised the alarm, several hours before, but no one answered. We are fed up with the announcements of these deaths that could be avoided.\u201d\nCaroline Willemen, MSF project coordinator on the Geo Barents, said: \u201cWe are once more witnessing Europe\u2019s unwillingness to provide the much needed dedicated and proactive search and rescue capacity in the central Mediterranean.\u201d\nIn less than 24 hours, Geo Barents performed three rescues in the Maltese and Libyan search and rescue zones, bringing 186 people safely on board, including the survivors from the boat where 10 died. Those rescued were from Guinea, Nigeria, Ivory Coast, Somalia and Syria, and included several children, the youngest only 10 months old.\nWith the attention of the European authorities focused on the humanitarian crisis on the Polish-Belarusian border, Geo Barents, with nearly 200 asylum seekers and 10 dead bodies, must urgently find a place of safety to disembark.\nAn estimated 1,225 people have died or gone missing while attempting to cross the central Mediterranean so far this year. Since 2014, 22,825 people have gone missing or died on this route.\n\u201cIt has become the deadliest migration route, and it is shameful,\u201d Willemen said.",

In summer, walk-ins are welcomed, DJs spin real records, the barbecue is sometimes fired up and there\u2019s always a good gaggle of customers hanging around on the huge terrace just above the sand. It\u2019s not new, new, perhaps, but Harry\u2019s has become part of the local landscape during lockdown.\nOut of work and spurred on by local fisherman Peter Boston, who supplied them with a catch of lobster, Stevie and Rebekah McCarry put a message out on social media in lockdown that they were starting out as fishmongers, and within the hour they had sold the entire catch. They were the talk of the town. From there it\u2019s been a whirlwind. Soon they were selling lobster rolls, monkfish ceviche and other dishes as Native Seafood & Scran. Rebekah says: \u201cWe changed the menu up every day, depending on what the boats brought in, which made for a stressful, sometimes hilarious scramble as we shot off around the area to get the ingredients needed for each dish every morning.\u201d There are now plans to open a proper sit-down restaurant in the old yacht club in September. Until then, you can buy seafood from the pod in front, where there are often queues round the corner.\nOpened in 2015, the beer from the community-owned Lacada Brewery in the seaside resort of Portrush, County Antrim, is not your standard fare. There are both the raspberry and the mango \u201csmoothie\u201d IPAs, for starters, plus a new line in sour beers, which can be found in many local pubs and shops. The brewery decided to press on with plans to upgrade and improve through lockdown, producing 26 new beers in a year. Stormont red tape doesn\u2019t make it easy for microbreweries in the north, so there is no tap room at present, but as soon as it is feasible they will be running brewery tours again.\nIn January 2020 Geri Martin moved her bespoke chocolate business, the Chocolate Manor, to the coastal village of Castlerock, Co Derry, with a view to running chocolate experiences. \u201cWe were weeks away from our official opening when we closed due to Covid,\u201d Geri says. \u201cMy team and I went home to home-school, and I didn\u2019t know if we\u2019d ever reopen.\u201d But reopen they did, turning the premises into a chocolate shop and artisan food emporium supporting other businesses that are part of the Taste Causeway collective. Chocolate experiences \u2013 from alcohol and food pairings (whiskey and chocolate anyone?) to making your own box of chocolates \u2013 are also now up and running for private groups, and prices start at \u00a325pp.\nThough there is also a restaurant in Belfast, it\u2019s the Mourne Seafood Bar in Dundrum, Newcastle, where you can try fresh shellfish in a pebble throw from the Co Down coast, that really suits the fresh-from-the-sea dishes. This year, as well as the restaurant, the company has also launched a hot food bar called Squid Shack a short walk away, where you can try classic fish and chips and favourites like salt\u2019n\u2019chilli boxes with a choice of squid or prawns. Perfect for customers who want to grab something and cross the road for dinner with views of Dundrum Bay.\nIf you like to work a little for your supper then these foodie adventures with Mobile Team Adventure, in which you do some coastal canoeing before landing ashore, learn how to make soda bread and then fill up on lashings of tea and homemade cake sound pretty perfect. Guests head out from Ballymorran Bay by canoe to Strangford Lough, a marine nature reserve where harbour seals, herons, occasional otters and even the odd surprise whale can be spotted, before popping to an island or two. Tracey is a local tour guide who runs cookery classes from her very own Farmhouse Kitchen. Three-hour canoe/cookery courses cost \u00a365pp.\nWhat began as a pop-up in February 2021 in the Cathedral Quarter\u2019s Hill Street Hatch \u2013 a space that gives up-and-coming culinary talent the chance to test ideas without exorbitant costs \u2013 the Toast Office is here to stay. It was either that or Belfast would have had an angry mob of cheese toastie fans on its hands. These fully-loaded grilled cheese sandwiches use locally sourced, high-quality ingredients and have proved incredibly popular \u2013 the slow-cooked ham hock with Coolattin Irish cheddar certainly lives up to its \u201cfancy ham and cheese\u201d name. Now based in a permanent kiosk by the nearby Dark Horse pub, you can sit down and enjoy a pint with your sandwich or eat it as you tour some of Belfast\u2019s famous sights.\nSet up in the summer of 2020 as an artist-run cafe and social space in a suburban neighbourhood of south Belfast, Fruit Shop is forging deep-rooted relationships with local producers and growers, while creating a place where the whole community can feel at ease. The cafe sells good coffee and has a mood-lifting brunch menu with excellent vegan options. The doughnuts have some of the most outlandish pastry and filling combos ever, and events such as last autumn\u2019s Feast of Saxifrage, an art and food-sharing project as part of the Outburst Queer Arts festival, bring the residents of Galwally together through the age-old tradition of breaking bread.\nIn late 2019, David Lafferty finally realised a long-held dream to buy his own restaurant \u2013 the Castle Street Social \u2013 and then, well, we all know what happened. David just about made it through the first lockdown, but he then shrewdly prepared for the next one by launching a baked goods service through the restaurant, offering homemade bread and cakes to take away. Now people are allowed inside again, the restaurant, which sometimes collaborates with other food and drink producers, is building up a good reputation for its small plates, which use local produce, and fabulous cocktails \u2013 the strawberry and raspberry G and Tea, for instance, is inspired.\nDerry\u2019s food revolution may be slower than that of other cities, but street food here is finally catching [itself] on. Pyke \u2018N\u2019 Pommes is a case in point. Over the past eight or so years it\u2019s gradually grown in status from selling food from an adapted van in an old car park to running out of a converted shipping container by the River Foyle with a doubledecker bus and DJ, to a proper, grown-up restaurant on the Strand Road in 2020. Don\u2019t worry, the more rustic POD isn\u2019t going anywhere, but now customers can also enjoy a restaurant environment as they tuck into wagyu beef burgers cooked from scratch (with meat from local breeder Joe McGinnis) without worrying about the weather.\nFor several years former nurse Bronagh Duffin has been helping people \u201cheal\u201d through her cookery lessons in the countryside by recreating the warmth and love of her granny\u2019s kitchen, with a griddle over an open fire, good food and plenty of craic. \u201cIt takes me back to those feelings of being safe by my granny\u2019s side as she cooked,\u201d she says, \u201cand I want to transport my guests to a place that conjures up similar feelings for them.\u201d Though lockdown forced many of the lessons on to the dreaded Zoom, now her Bakehouse classes such as \u201cdigging for gin\u201d, in which guests forage for berries, and \u201cfamily day out\u201d, in which you\u2019re encouraged to cook your meal of choice together, are to take place in person again, which sounds like good therapy to us.\nIn the foothills of the Mountains of Mourne, hillwalkers have found this vintage horsebox a welcome sight over the past few months. The Hen and Cock Coffee Dock (named after nearby hills), run by couple Ally and Jamie, only set up shop in January this year but is doing a roaring trade selling coffee, cakes and milkshakes as more and more locals take to the hills. It\u2019s a place particularly popular with families as Hen Mountain is a beginner\u2019s mountain \u2013 \u201cTake the path into the bog, it\u2019s a dander walk, which is calm and peaceful\u201d Ally says. And don\u2019t forget to stop off on your way back \u2013 on Thursday evenings they do s\u2019mores, which should be enough of a bribe for the kids.\nCounty Armagh is renowned for its Bramley apples and at Wee Buns Cookery School, just outside Moy in Dungannon (near the border with Tyrone), founder Mary Anne Mackle is hoping to connect visitors and the local community with the traditional recipes she grew up with after they\u2019ve taken a tour of the orchard. As well as tasting some of the produce from the orchard \u2013 apple cider vinegar, chutney and apple jelly \u2013 you will also learn how to make a little-known (outside Armagh, anyway) recipe of potato apple bread (like apple tart but with potato bread in place of pastry). In harvest time guests can also come and help with apple picking. Half-day orchard and apple-baking tours are \u00a370pp.\nAt the newly restored boutique guest house of Hillyard House, on the edge of the Castlewellan Forest Park, you can enjoy craft beers in the bar, or sit down for a locally sourced lunch or dinner in The Yard restaurant. Dundrum mussels and Portavogie prawns appeal on the menu, but it\u2019s the meat really that takes centre stage here \u2013 ethically raised beef (farm to fork) hung for optimum time on the restaurant\u2019s Himalayan salt seat ager before being cooked on the broiler makes for a really good steak.\nBefore craft beer and cider tours, Ireland is known for its whiskey, and if you\u2019d like an alternative to touristy Bushmills then try the craft Hinch Distillery in the beautiful setting of Killaney Estate in Co Down. The county was once home to seven whiskey distilleries and this one hopes to be part of a revival of whiskey-making in Ireland, using traditional techniques but modern ambition. Water for the grain-to-glass whiskey comes from the Mourne mountains \u2013 the triple distillation process is adhered to, and you can taste the results on a tour. As expected, the distillery also makes gin, and on its gin tour you get to make your own, which you can take home with you. Whiskey tours from \u00a318, gin experience \u00a345.",

Model consensus on the details is limited but it's likely to be problematic for some already sodden parts of the state. pic.twitter.com/u8FP3NZHaE\nSydney will also cop a drenching, with the Bureau of Meteorology forecasting 30-50mm for Sunday, \u201cwith heavy falls possible in the west\u201d of the city.\nThe track the low takes will make a big difference to local rainfall tallies.\nOne weather model has the system tracking further north, reaching the coast near Newcastle. \u201cFurther north, there\u2019s more moisture for it to tap into,\u201d Domensino said, adding that path could result in Sydney collecting as much as 100mm on Sunday into Monday.\nA second model has a more southerly course for the low, with regions south of Wollongong likely to receive the 100mm or so totals, he said.\nNSW\u2019s regional dams are 92% full, with some at or above capacity. Burrendong in central NSW is at 129% capacity, making use of its flood zone.\nSydney\u2019s reservoirs are at 96.3% capacity, with Warragamba \u2013 which holds about 80% of the city\u2019s water \u2013 at about 100%.\n\u201cWarragamba is not spilling but is in drawdown operations to reduce the storage from the full supply level,\u201d a WaterNSW spokesman said.\n\u201cThe storage is kept at one metre below full supply level, however that target is unlikely to be reached before the weekend,\u201d he said.\nWarragamba is currently receiving about 7.5 gigalitres of inflow a day and about 9GL a day is being released to create \u201cairspace\u201d to accommodate some of the expected falls.\nThe bureau\u2019s forecast for Warragamba is currently at 25-50mm of rain on Sunday.\nIt's looking rather wet for parts of #NSW this weekend especially from Saturday night and through Sunday. It's looking like there could be further #warnings issued and if you're anywhere from the western slopes out to the east it's worth keeping an eye on the forecast. pic.twitter.com/IcTZe8bgnF\nMore rain will follow within days as another low-pressure trough stretching from Queensland to Victoria moves eastwards.\nThat system, though, is unlikely to develop into a low, Domensino said. Rainfall will be widespread and, with catchments already saturated, more flooding could follow.\nWith conditions in the Pacific close to La Ni\u00f1a levels, these events are \u201cthe taste of what we will see this summer\u201d, he said.\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nDuring La Ni\u00f1a events, easterly blowing equatorial winds strengthen, shifting rainfall westwards towards Australia. Such events increase the odds for a more active than usual cyclone season for the region.\nThe Bureau of Meteorology may declare a La Ni\u00f1a event as soon as next Tuesday. Six of the seven models used by the bureau forecast a La Ni\u00f1a will last until January.",

Revenues rose by 7% year-on-year to \u00a36.1bn.\nThe news sent shares up 7% on Thursday, making the postal services firm the top riser on the FTSE 100 and pushing its market value up by \u00a3300m to \u00a34.7bn.\nThe strong financial recovery plus cash buffers built up during the pandemic have allowed Royal Mail to give shareholders money, despite its ongoing investments in automation to make it more efficient and efforts to make \u00a3110m in costs savings.\nIt said on Thursday it would return \u00a3400m via a \u00a3200m share buyback that will start immediately and a \u00a3200m special dividend. It will also pay a \u00a367m interim dividend.\nKeith Williams, Royal Mail\u2019s non-executive chair, insisted the company would be able to fund investment in new technology and growth from future cash flows, justifying the shareholder returns, even as it prepares for the crucial Christmas period.\nThe company failed to cope with parcel volumes at Christmas last year, but Simon Thompson, who was installed as chief executive in January this year, said it had improved its efficiency and invested in more double-decker lorries as well as driver training since then. The date of the last post for Christmas day has not been changed.\n\u201cThe things we learned we now have in place for this year,\u201d Thompson said.\nThe results mark a turnaround in fortunes for the delivery company, after the early pandemic lockdowns depressed Royal Mail\u2019s profits, adding new costs and hitting the volumes of letters sent.\nNevertheless, Royal Mail said it has experienced a \u201cstructural shift\u201d in parcels, with volumes up by a third during the financial half year compared with before the pandemic \u2013 although they were down by 4% compared with 2020, when customers were locked down at home and non-essential shops were closed.\nThe company, which was controversially privatised in 2013, has struggled with what it described as the \u201cstructural decline\u201d of letters as more people use email for official purposes, with revenues from parcels overtaking that from letters for the first time a year ago. It delivered more letters between April and September than the equivalent last year, but still a fifth less than in 2019.\nAt the same time Royal Mail has been restructuring. A new management team has brought in an agreement with the Communication Workers Union after a breakdown in the relationship under former chief executive Rico Back and cuts to 2,000 management jobs in June 2020.\nRoyal Mail has also been pushing to weaken some of the \u201cuniversal service\u201d requirements imposed on it as a former state-run operation, including removing the obligation to deliver post on Saturdays. Thompson hinted that it would push this agenda further, saying the company needs to \u201cstart defining what a sustainable universal service is for the future\u201d.\n\u201cWe have to acknowledge the world has changed,\u201d Thompson said. The company did not want to \u201cinvest in services that perhaps customers no longer need,\u201d he said.",

Subsequent papers released under the Freedom of Information Act and in parliament have revealed that recruits and their parents made 60 complaints of violent behaviour by staff at AFC between 2014 and 2020.\nLast Thursday an instructor at the college was demoted at a court martial after being convicted of punching two teenage soldiers. Cpl Kimberley Hey was acquitted of six other charges of battery relating to three other soldiers.\nThe parents have spoken out about their children\u2019s involvement with the college as part of wider calls to end recruitment of under-18s by the British army \u2013 one of the few militaries in the developed world to allow it \u2013 and as peers seek to amend a bill making its way through parliament to raise the recruitment age to 18.\nAlison Blackwell, who is waiting for an MoD inquiry into her son Nathan Worner\u2019s death to report back next year, said he went from being a confident and resilient person to being withdrawn and desperate to leave the army.\nHe alleged having been hit, slapped, pushed, kicked and verbally abused by staff during the first phase of his training at the AFC, and at 17 handed in a letter saying he wanted to leave. She said it was ripped up in his face.\n\u201cHe said he didn\u2019t expect to be faced with the disgusting way they were mistreated at Harrogate. He described the staff as animals that got off on hurting and humiliating people and that Harrogate should be shut down,\u201d she said of her son, who was found dead at his army barracks in May last year.\nCharlotte Poad, the mother of a young soldier who has said three friends who trained with him at the college took their own lives, said her son returned from Harrogate a \u201ccompletely different person\u201d and was discharged from the army on mental health grounds just over a year ago after a long struggle.\nShe said her son struggled to talk about what happened at the AFC, but she and her husband believed that staff bullied and abused young recruits and encouraged fighting among them. Recruits were also made to spend many hours alone on guard duty, which affected their mental health, she said.\n\u201cI strongly believe that the Army Foundation College does not look after children\u2019s mental health or wellbeing. It is an outdated institution where bullies thrive and adults seek pleasure in seeing children broken,\u201d Poad said.\nAnother parent, Kevin, who does not want to identified by his full name, said his son came home \u201cbroken and exhausted\u201d shortly after enlisting at 16. He says what followed was a struggle to get him out.\n\u201cIn our conversations, we had to constantly remind officers that he was only 16 and in our care, even though he had sworn an oath to the British army. [A] major conceded in the end, but then another officer indicated that our son would be charged with going awol, and said that he would never get a job or go to another college or university. Again, we were incensed \u2013 more phone calls.\u201d\nCharlotte Cooper, the campaigns coordinator at CRIN, said: \u201cAFC has a long record of formal complaints of violent abuse by its staff against the young people in its care, including 10 such allegations since 2017, and Ofsted inspectors don\u2019t think it worth mentioning. I think teenagers and their parents would be shocked to know that an institution rated \u2018outstanding\u2019 had AFC\u2019s record of violence against children by instructors.\u201d\nAn army spokesperson said: \u201cWe have a very strong duty of care and safeguarding mechanisms at AFC Harrogate to ensure junior soldiers have the right support structure and welfare provision, including confidential support lines. AFC Harrogate, alongside all phase 1 and phase 2 training organisations, are subject to Ofsted inspection on a routine basis.\u201d\nThe college was awarded an overall grade of \u201coutstanding\u201d after an inspection in May as part of the 2020/21 inspection cycle into welfare and duty of care in armed forces initial training.\nAn Ofsted spokesperson said it inspected the welfare of recruits and trainees against the criteria set out in an inspection handbook for armed forces training establishments.\n\u201cThe inspection team were aware of the concerns raised by CRIN. However, we do not investigate individual complaints, but we will always take onboard any received as part of our inspection,\u201d they said.\n\u201cOur inspectors met with recruits at different stages of training to discuss their experiences of care, welfare and training. And, at the time, all recruits were highly positive about their training, as well as the treatment and support they received from staff.\u201d\n In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

Everyone should be able to source their Christmas turkey this year, which is great news.\u201d\nBoparan owns East Anglian turkey producer Bernard Matthews, and the 2 sisters food group. B\nHis 600 farms and 16 factories, which employ 18,000 people, are short of about 10% of their ideal workforce \u2013 or about 1,800 roles. However, that has reduced from a shortage of about 15% earlier in the year.\nThe government announced in September that 5,500 poultry workers from overseas would be able to work in the UK ahead of Christmas. The temporary visa scheme was introduced amid concerns that new post-Brexit immigration rules combined with the impact of the pandemic had led to a record number of food manufacturing workers returning to their home countries, leaving poultry processing plants with huge labour shortages.\nBoparan said he hoped that a similar scheme would be in place for next year with an earlier start date for processing visas.\nHe has previously warned that a shortage of labour would mean less choice and potentially empty shelves and higher prices for shoppers because of wage inflation.\nLast month Boparan said the cost of chicken was set to rise by more than 10%, adding that food in Britain was currently \u201ctoo cheap\u201d.\nOn Wednesday, he said: \u201cLabour as a key structural challenge for our sector is here for 12 months of the year, and it\u2019s one that\u2019s not going to go away.\n\u201cWe simply don\u2019t want to see our industry shrinking when the demand is as big as ever, especially at Christmas. It would be silly to plug any gaps by using imports, for instance. We don\u2019t think the British consumer wants to see that.\u201d\nBoparan\u2019s latest comments come as the Food Standards Agency wrote to meat producers to reassure them that it was putting in place additional measures to ensure that processing would not be widely held up by a shortage of vets.\nColin Sullivan, chief operating officer of the FSA, told industry journal Food Manufacture that there may be \u201csporadic interruptions\u201d when it would have to work with individual businesses on when vets could be provided to approve conditions in abattoirs, an essential part of the slaughtering process.\nThe FSA said there were about a 20% fewer vets than then \u201coptimum level\u201d because of high demand across Europe and the impact of the pandemic and \u201cmigration patterns\u201d. However, it said it had put up extra funds to improve pay to retain sufficient number of vets alongside other measures such as enabling overseas workers with a slightly lower level of English to carry out certain restricted jobs, for example.",

The deal with Ocado resulted in M&S being able to begin selling groceries online for home delivery for the first time just over a year ago.\nM&S has also tested its Simply Food convenience store outlets in WH Smith stores and provided food for some British Airways flights for about three years ending in 2020.\nMeanwhile, M&S has been revamping its stores and products to appeal more to families, helping the group return to a pre-tax profit in the six months to October after a loss of almost \u00a388m in the same period last year.\nThe strong performance reflected a 10% jump in food sales as well as \u201csubstantial improvement\u201d across its once struggling clothing and homeware business.\nStuart Machin, the managing director of M&S\u2019s food division, said: \u201cBringing together delicious, great quality M&S food and the nation\u2019s largest chain of coffee shops is great for customers as it extends our reach and supports our strategy of making M&S more relevant, more often for families.\u201d\nAnalysts said the tie-up could be good for both parties, with M&S benefiting from extra sales and the higher volumes lifting its profit margins. Costa has the chance to extend the variety food it offers, particularly on healthy eating and new trends such as plant-based foods in which M&S has already developed full ranges.\nBryan Roberts, a retail analyst at Shopfloor Insights, said retailers were looking at new ways to sell their products in local neighbourhoods as trips to city centres had reduced during the pandemic. \u201cLifestyles are changing with the shift to working from home and Costa needs to raise its game on food and M&S has the brand name and credentials [to help it do that],\u201d he said.\nNeil Lake, the managing director of Costa Coffee\u2019s UK and Irish division, said: \u201cThis collaboration with M&S \u2026 will build on our existing food range and help us fulfil our ambition to become the first choice for customers buying food and coffee on-the-go.\u201d",

        "content": "Exclusive: Seduced by salary promises, workers at Fifa-endorsed hotels allege they have been exploited and abused\nWhen Fifa executives step on to the asphalt in Doha next November for the start of the 2022 World Cup finals, their next stop is likely to be the check-in at one of Qatar\u2019s glittering array of opulent hotels, built to provide the most luxurious possible backdrop to the biggest sporting event on earth.\nNow, with a year to go before the first match, fans who want to emulate the lifestyle of the sporting elite can head to Fifa\u2019s hospitality website to plan their stay in the host nation. There they can scroll through a catalogue of exclusive, Fifa-endorsed accommodation, from boutique hotels to five-star resorts.\nYet behind the scenes of some of those hotels, while guests lounge around the pool or sip cocktails at the bar, migrant hotel workers claim they are struggling to survive on wages of \u00a31 an hour.\nThe Guardian stayed at or visited seven of the hotels listed on Fifa\u2019s hospitality website and in interviews and conversations with more than 40 workers \u2013 employed directly and through sub-contractors \u2013 uncovered a number of allegations of serious labour rights violations and low wages. The hotels have not been named to protect the identity of the workers who spoke to the Guardian.\nMany workers alleged they worked extremely long hours, with some saying they had not had a day off for months. While they spent their days surrounded by the most luxurious of settings, some workers said they were housed in overcrowded rooms in stifling labour camps. A few workers claimed their passports had been confiscated. Many said their employer would not let them change jobs.\nWhile rooms in the hotels listed on Fifa\u2019s hospitality site are charged at up to \u00a3820 a night when bought as part of a package, almost every worker the Guardian spoke to employed in housekeeping, security, valet service, cleaning or gardening said they earned less than \u00a31.25 an hour. Many were working for less than \u00a31 an hour.\nWorkers made multiple allegations of breaches of Qatar\u2019s labour law, which suggest shortcomings in Qatar\u2019s labour reforms. These promised an end to abusive working conditions and the kafala sponsorship system that meant workers could not change jobs or leave the country without their employer\u2019s consent.\nThe workers\u2019 allegations also imply that Fifa has failed to effectively carry out basic checks on the hotels investigated by the Guardian that it had signed up to its catalogue, in breach of its own human rights policy, which requires it to prevent labour abuses linked to its operations.\nWhile most workers the Guardian spoke to received salaries in line with the new minimum wage, which came into force in March 2021, that wage still equates to only \u00a31 an hour plus a small allowance for food and board.\nThe Guardian has also seen payslips from one worker employed directly by a hotel in Fifa\u2019s catalogue, which show that when the minimum wage was introduced his basic wage of 750 rials (\u00a3150) rose to 1,000 rials (\u00a3200) a month, but allowances for food or transport, for example, were cut by the same amount, meaning his salary stayed the same.\n\u201cSometimes I ask myself why I came here,\u201d he said. \u201cThe World Cup is a big thing and everyone enjoys it, but the way they treat us \u2026 we are all tired of it.\u201d\nAs darkness fell on one of the properties in Fifa\u2019s brochure, guests retired indoors, leaving David*, a migrant worker from Africa, labouring near the swimming pool.\nA night in a standard room in the hotel costs more than David earns in a month. He is desperate to change jobs but despite recent government legislation allowing this, he sayssaid he is trapped. \u201cMy friends have tried to change jobs but our company refuses to let them go,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to accept it. Our boss does whatever he wants.\u201d\nThe hotel boasts sumptuous suites and a marble-lined lobby, but his own lodgings are starkly different: a small room shared with five others in a run-down compound on the edge of Doha.\nRanjit, a security guard, stood on duty nearby, as he had done for the previous 11 hours. Ranjit\u2019s salary works out at about 80p an hour. Yet for five months he kept nothing; everything went towards paying off the illegal \u00a31,300 fee he was forced to hand a recruitment agent back home to secure the job. \u201cIt\u2019s a scam,\u201d he said. \u201cHere they suck your blood.\u201d\nSome workers across the seven hotels said they were happy with their jobs and the staff accommodation provided by their hotels. Yet the majority said they felt trapped between the demands of their employers and the need to earn money for their families back in their own countries.\nAt one hotel, a worker alleged that the management would only give bonuses to staff who handed over their passports. It is illegal for employers to keep workers\u2019 passports in Qatar.\n\u201cWe have fallen into a trap and can\u2019t get out,\u201d said another worker at the hotel.\nWith 1.2 million fans expected during the World Cup, the hospitality sector can look forward to a lucrative tournament.\nA few hotels demonstrated good practice by recruiting their staff directly through online adverts, rather than through labour agents who often extract extortionate and illegal fees from recruits, but even in these properties the Guardian spoke to staff who were paid very low wages.\nThe worst allegations of abuse were by workers employed through sub-contractors, in particular hotel security guards and gardeners.\nAt another hotel on Fifa\u2019s website a Kenyan security guard was about to begin his 12-hour shift, which he said stretched beyond 15 hours when he added travel time to and from his labour camp.\nIf he works all month without a break he earns 2,000 rials (\u00a3400); far less than he was promised when he signed up for the job in Kenya. If he took a day off, his employer would cut his wages by 50 rials (\u00a310). Not that he often had that option. \u201cDuring the summer we had to work for three months without a day off,\u201d he said.\nHis passport has been confiscated by his company. \u201cMaybe they think if you have your passport you can run away to another company,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have no other option, so we take what is on the table.\u201d\nThe Guardian\u2019s findings have shone a spotlight directly on world football\u2019s governing body, which has been criticised by Amnesty International for taking a \u201chands-off\u201d approach to workers\u2019 rights in the host nation. A spokesperson for Fifa said it \u201ctakes any claim concerning the rights of workers contributing to the hosting of Fifa events very seriously\u201d.\nThe spokesperson said a dedicated team was implementing an audit and compliance system for companies involved in the delivery of the World Cup, including hotels, to ensure workers\u2019 rights were respected. \u201cWhile there is a need for continued improvement, we have already seen important progress by many hotels in Qatar in recent months,\u201d the spokesperson added.\nIsobel Archer, a specialist in labour rights in the Gulf at the Business & Human Rights Resource Centre (BHRRC), a charity headquartered in London, said hotels must recognise their responsibilities to all workers, including those employed through sub-contractors.\n\u201cIf hotel brands put even half the effort into scrutinising their suppliers\u2019 labour practices as they do the height of their reception desks or the density of guest room pillows, we\u2019d see transformational change for hotel workers,\u201d she said.\nA report by the BHRRC this year also found evidence of widespread exploitation of hotel workers in Qatar which, it said, should be a \u201cred flag\u201d for football teams, fans and corporate sponsors.\nA Qatari official said the government \u201ctakes any violation of its labour laws very seriously, including those in the hospitality sector\u201d. The official said Qatar had a zero-tolerance approach towards violating companies, issuing harsh penalties that included fines and prison sentences.\n\u201cAwareness-raising initiatives have been launched to provide workers with information on how to raise complaints against their employer, and new mechanisms have been introduced to facilitate better access to justice,\u201d the official added. \n*Names have been changed or omitted to protect workers\u2019 identities.",

        "content": "Filipino journalist and peace prize laureate says sites are biased against facts and in need of overhaul\nSocial media platforms are biased against facts and creating \u201ca virus of lies\u201d that threatens all democracies, the Nobel peace prize-winning journalist Maria Ressa has said.\nRessa, one of the Philippines\u2019 most prominent journalists, said social media platforms were \u201cmanipulating our minds insidiously, creating alternate realities, making it impossible for us to think slow\u201d.\nFocusing simply on moderating social media content was a distraction, she said, and it was the design of platforms, and the algorithms they used to promote content, that were in need of an overhaul.\nSpeaking at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute\u2019s Sydney Dialogue, Ressa accused social media companies of misusing arguments around freedom of speech. \u201cIt\u2019s a freedom of reach issue, not a freedom of speech issue,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThere\u2019s something fundamentally wrong with our information ecosystem. Because the platforms that deliver the facts are actually biased against the facts,\u201d she added, pointing to Facebook as the world\u2019s largest delivery platform for news.\nRessa was awarded the Nobel prize along with the Russian journalist Dmitry Muratov last month for their \u201ccourageous fight for freedom of expression, a precondition for democracy and lasting peace\u201d.\nShe co-founded the news website Rappler in 2012 and it hasbecome one of the Philippines\u2019 most popular news outlets, known for scrutinising Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s administration.\nRappler has not only covered Duterte\u2019s war on drugs and exposed government corruption but also explored the ways in which social media can be manipulated by populist leaders.\nRessa said no democracies were immune from such threats. \u201cI think what the tech platforms have shown is exactly how easy it is to use technology to manipulate human biology,\u201d she said, adding that this transcended different countries and cultures.\nWhile regulation had been put in place by many governments to protect against other potentially dangerous technologies, they had failed to do the same for information technology, which would continue to develop in sophistication. \u201c[Technology] is thinking word for word faster than any human being ever can. And you\u2019re not going to be able to get AI to fix the problems that human beings have created.\u201d\nRessa said the world needed to take radical steps to protect democracies, as it had previously done at other key turning points in history. \u201cPost world war II, we didn\u2019t want world war III with atom bombs. That has already happened in our information ecosystem. It is manipulating our minds,\u201d she said.\nGoogle\u2019s senior vice-president of global affairs, Kent Walker, who also spoke at the session, said transparency around algorithms was complicated owing to the frequency with which they were changed to prevent people from exploiting the system.\n\u201cI think we made 2,500, 3,000 changes last year \u2026 I think there\u2019s a role for transparency, but we need to think through \u2013 is it with trusted government reviewers or [are there] other ways of keeping the bad actors from actually being able to reduce the quality of the search results you get, for example. This is a complicated area,\u201d he said, adding there was a danger that many governments would also seek to manipulate search results.\nRessa said the decision to award her a Nobel prize showed the scale of the crisis facing journalism and information. \u201cBecause the last time journalists got this prize was in 1936, and he didn\u2019t get to go to get the prize, he languished in a Nazi concentration camp,\u201d she said. (Carl von Ossietzky, a German journalist, won the 1935 Nobel peace prize.)\nRessa has faced relentless harassment online and in the courts in response to her reporting. She has previously described receiving \u201c90 hate messages an hour, 90 rape threats per minute\u201d. She has faced a series of legal cases ranging from alleged tax evasion to defamation, and is out on bail appealing against a six-year prison sentence for a libel conviction.",

        "content": "Fans at home see Erasmus as a brave knight, charging into dragon fire to preserve the dignity of his people\nThe Springboks are in need of a new water carrier for Saturday\u2019s match at Twickenham. Responsibilities include marshalling the defence, identifying weaknesses in the opposition\u2019s line and relaying important information from the coach\u2019s box. Oh, and hydrating the players on the field.\nThe incumbent, Rassie Erasmus, who moonlights as the director of rugby, has been banned from all rugby activities for two months and suspended from all match\u2011day activities until September next year. His punishment, meted out by World Rugby for his 62-minute video in which he criticised in detail the refereeing performance of Nic Berry in the first Test of the British & Irish Lions tour, also carries a warning \u201cas to his future conduct\u201d. Erasmus has been instructed to apologise to the relevant match officials, as has SA Rugby, which must now pay a \u00a320,000 fine.\nErasmus and SA Rugby will appeal. Of course they will. This saga was never going to end quietly, whatever verdict the global governing body landed on. What is more intriguing is how this changes the cultural landscape of South African rugby and its standing abroad.\nSeveral newspapers and websites \u2013 including this one \u2013 suggested Erasmus\u2019s reputation has been \u201cshredded\u201d and that it \u201clies in tatters\u201d. That may be true in other countries but that is certainly not the case back in South Africa. If anything it has enhanced his status, turning him into a martyr of sorts, a righteous campaigner who knew the risks of standing up to those with their hands on the levers of power and did it anyway. According to his defenders Erasmus is not an unhinged maniac, he is a brave knight charging into dragon fire to preserve the dignity of his people.\nSouth African rugby fans are fickle, but they are loyal. They can also be insecure at times. This is a wider societal issue in a former colony that is the most economically unequal in the world, where honest politicians are as rare as drop-kicking props, where a full day without a power cut is considered a luxury and where crime stats \u2013 particularly against women \u2013 are both astounding and numbing. The Springboks stand out. This team is the country\u2019s best asset right now. And an attack on one is an attack on all.\nAfter lifting the Webb Ellis Cup in 2019, Siya Kolisi\u2019s side became the darlings of the game. A Laureus World Sports award for team of the year capped off a remarkable journey, one encapsulated in a tear-jerking documentary that Erasmus co-produced. The most racially diverse Springbok outfit included players who had risen out of poverty. This was more than a team, it was a symbol, one eclipsing even the heroes of 1995.\nThen Covid hit. With South Africa placed under strict lockdown, the Springboks were denied their year-long victory parade. As the Six Nations continued in empty stadiums, and their southern hemisphere rivals played on without them, the glow of their triumph faded.\nThey entered the Lions tour undercooked and eager to assert their champion status. That this would come against a unified force from the British Isles is significant. The Home Nations have long plundered South African talent and some hangovers from the days of empire have yet to recede. That Erasmus is Afrikaans has not been lost in the narrative.\nThe mood was already sour by the time Erasmus released/leaked/accidentally hit \u201csend\u201d on his video. Warren Gatland, the Lions coach, had questioned a referee\u2019s decision in a press conference and hostilities between journalists, at times acting as jingoistic cheerleaders, were adding a sordid intrigue to a contest stripped of fans as a result of the pandemic.\nBut, and this should be obvious no matter your allegiance, Erasmus took it too far. World Rugby\u2019s 80-page report revealed that he threatened Berry that unless a request for a private meeting took place, he would publish the critical footage. However the video was made public, Erasmus seemingly made good on that threat.\n\u201cOne of the points made by the respondents is that referees must be able to accept feedback,\u201d the judgment stated. \u201cThat is a fair observation. However, there is a difference between feedback and abuse.\u201d\nThis verdict places power back in the hands of referees but it will not dispel questions concerning the content of Erasmus\u2019s video. A poor decision from a referee can cost a coach his job. This already delicate relationship has been damaged.\nBerry\u2019s testimony humanised the affair: \u201cThe whole situation has been an extremely difficult time for my family and I. His actions are against everything our game stands for and I feel it\u2019s important to take a stand against such behaviour.\u201d\nA stand has been taken, opinions on either side of the divide have calcified, and a team that were not long ago a bastion of hope around the world have now become a lightning rod for a toxic chapter in rugby\u2019s history.\nNone of this will have a major bearing on Saturday\u2019s match against England though, like the World Rugby awards snub this week, it may provide extra motivation for the players. Those 80 minutes will likely be as intense as any match between the Springbok and Red Rose. After that, the circus will roll on.",

However, some countries are reluctant to strengthen their targets \u2013 Australia, whose target is widely deemed inadequate, has already signalled its refusal, while the US and the EU have said their targets are good enough.\nSelamawit Wubet, a programme coordinator at the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF), told the Guardian: \u201cAround half of all parties met the Paris agreement deadline [to produce new NDCs by the end of 2020]. So it will be an uphill battle to encourage countries to revise them again.\n\u201cWhat is most crucial is to have a common voice from all key actors: the Cop presidencies [of the UK, which hosted Cop26, and Egypt, host of Cop27], the UNFCCC [United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change] secretariat, the UN secretary general, as well as key negotiation and party blocs.\u201d\nShe said being able to review each country\u2019s NDC speedily would be key, adding that Cop26 showed that \u201ccountries can come up with better contributions when expectations are very clear for that\u201d.\nMembers of the CVF, which represents more than 55 countries and more than 1.4 billion people around the world in places most at risk from extreme weather, told the Guardian their efforts had at least partly paid off before Cop26.\nWubet pointed to the CVF\u2019s \u201cbarometer\u201d, an evaluation of NDCs up to 31 December 2020, which the bloc is looking to repeat before the next Cop in November 2022. The United Nations Environment Programme also performed \u201crobust evaluations\u201d of individual NDCs, though Wubet noted it did not pass judgment where baseline and other differences required additional calculations, and the UNFCCC published a \u201csynthesis report\u201d taking the NDCs in aggregate.\n\u201cSome other technical partners also track NDCs but there is varying evaluation criteria, whereas it\u2019s very important to be clear whether a country did in fact increase ambition or not versus their previous NDC,\u201d she said.\nSara Ahmed, a finance adviser to the V20 group of 20 finance ministers from the CVF, said countries should recognise the benefits of cutting emissions and moving to a greener economy, which would create jobs and improve health.\nShe told the Guardian: \u201cThe pressure to deliver is not only a survival deadline and political, it is economic and financial in nature. The shift to a low-carbon and climate-resilient economy translates to greater socioeconomic gains. There are more jobs in renewable energy than fossil fuel.\u201d\nThe energy crisis, resulting in high gas prices around the world, pointed to the economic benefits of a low-carbon economy, Ahmed added. \u201cThe current market volatility of fossil fuels and high spot prices will impact balance of supply and demand, and investor pressure will only continue to build. The 1.5C limit is the only way forward to safeguard global financial stability in today\u2019s highly interconnected world.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cHigh emitter laggard countries not only break the trust the world has given them, but likely suffer economically. For example, failure by Australia to deliver 1.5C-compatible climate targets this decade will shrink Australia\u2019s GDP by 6% and lock in an increase in net debt in New South Wales to 100% by 2060, with taxpayers ultimately footing the bill.\u201d\nThe government of Bangladesh, as chair of the CVF, issued a statement welcoming the outcome of Cop26. The chair said: \u201cThe vulnerable nations brought demands for urgency to Cop26 in particular on keeping 1.5C alive, reaffirming delivery of crucial climate finance, and accelerating adaptation through stronger finance.\n\u201cOn all these priorities of the most climate threatened nations Cop26 has delivered substantial progress: 1.5C is alive even if it remains on lifeline watch. We have nine years left to cut global emissions in half and the world has recognised the urgency of the situation in Glasgow \u2013 now the hard work begins back home in all the nations of the world to deliver on the Cop26 agreements.\u201d",

Positioning him more as merry-making master of ceremonies than standup comedian, it plays to Brydon\u2019s strengths.\nIn such a context, for Brydon to ask, \u201cWhat is it about me that attracts the old and the infirm?\u201d can only be richly ironic. He knows full well that his latterday Max Bygraves shtick does not deliver the shock of the new. But he also loves to tease his audience \u2013 mainly, tonight, for their decrepitude. Such exchanges offer glimpses of the wolf one sometimes discerns under Brydon\u2019s sheep\u2019s clothing. But otherwise it\u2019s showtunes and hip-shaking Elvis numbers, as well as heart-on-sleeve balladry memorialising the Welshman\u2019s first kiss, his first girlfriend, and the birth of his first child.\nIt\u2019s always a showbiz confection, the autobiographical storytelling never more than skin-deep. But it usually works. Brydon can hold a tune and pack feeling into it; he\u2019s backed by an excellent band led by Paul Herbert (ribbed ruthlessly throughout) \u2013 and his anecdotes zero in endearingly on his own indignity and ineptitude. For all that he jokes otherwise, his voice work and celeb mimicry is, as ever with Brydon, another highlight.\nIt\u2019s a matter of only mild regret that the story-of-my-life narrative peters out in act two, which devolves into singalongs of Sweet Caroline and Brydon\u2019s chart-topping Islands in the Stream, performed in character as Gavin and Stacey\u2019s Uncle Bryn. A bespoke lyric, written during the interval to incorporate Brydon\u2019s interactions with the crowd, is a bit weak \u2013 some acts improvise this stuff \u2013 but after a show dedicated to Brydon\u2019s pal Barry Humphries, making himself conspicuous in the crowd, no one leaves this feelgood evening under-entertained.\nAt the London Palladium on 18 November and touring until 16 July",

        "content": "The Rugby Football League has approved the game-wide introduction of mouthguards that could detect whether or not a player is at risk of a concussion or head trauma. The guards, which were trialled by Leeds Rhinos this year, will come in next season and could provide greater understanding of when an individual is in danger by measuring through sensors the force of every collision they experience during a match.\nSuper League clubs have unanimously backed the introduction of the guards but the Guardian has now learned that the RFL has made the decision to adopt them more broadly as part of its Tackle initiative. The Women\u2019s Super League, academy rugby and the community game will all benefit from the rollout, which has been developed in conjunction with Leeds Beckett University to try to improve the overall safety of players.\nConcussion is high on the agenda in rugby league, particularly given the news that a group of former international players are planning legal action against the sport\u2019s authorities over a failure to protect them properly from long-term neurological injuries as a result of playing the game. The former Leeds captain Stevie Ward announced his retirement from the sport at the age of 27 in January because of persistent concussion-related symptoms.\n\u201cThe guards measure head acceleration profile and track impact to the head and rotational force,\u201d Prof Ben Jones, who works for the Rhinos and has helped lead the study, told the Guardian. Other governing bodies such as union\u2019s World Rugby have introduced the mouthguards but Jones insists rugby league is breaking barriers by rolling the concept out across an entire sport, including the professional and amateur games at the same time.\nJones added that the mouthguards were \u201cinitially going out across Super League but the RFL has committed to roll this out across the whole game. It\u2019s utterly comprehensive. The Super League clubs have helped lead it and they understand the safety of their players is greater than winning a game on the weekend. They should be commended for that. They\u2019ve been through a lot but they understand the welfare and safety of their players is the absolute priority.\n\u201cI think other big governing bodies will follow off the back of this. Rugby league is making an effort to look after everyone in one go. I would argue that rugby league\u2019s commitment to this is proof that they are determined to look after their players the best they possibly can.\u201d\nJones also insisted that as scientific research into concussion and head trauma deepens, further initiatives could become available to offer more protection. \u201cI think rugby league is ahead of where it was, as is all sport in general,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t just pull evidence out of the air, it has to accumulate over years. Every six months is better than the previous six months. The scientific evidence evolves over time and these guards are proof of that.\u201d",

Rowley recovered but Sturgess died.\nSturgess\u2019s family had pushed for her inquest, which is being overseen by the life peer Heather Hallett, to be converted into a public inquiry, believing that this would be the best way to get to the truth of what happened.\nDawn\u2019s father, Stan Sturgess, said he was pleased at the development. He said: \u201cWe welcome the decision, our legal team has worked tirelessly on our behalf and hopefully in the near future we will finally have closure.\u201d\nThe family had been concerned at a suggestion from Home Office lawyers that the full hearing the poisonings might not be heard until 2023. Sturgess said he was pleased at the prospect of it taking place next year.\nThe home secretary, Priti Patel, said on Thursday: \u201cThe government is establishing an inquiry after careful consideration of advice from Lady Hallett that this is necessary to permit all relevant evidence to be heard. This is an important step in ensuring that the family of Dawn Sturgess get the answers they need. The current inquest will be adjourned after the establishment of the inquiry.\n\u201cThe inquiry\u2019s investigations will be a matter for the chair. As the sponsoring department, the Home Office will provide support and ensure that the inquiry has the resources that it needs.\u201d\nPatel said she was keen to keep the Sturgess family at the heart of the inquiry and has written to them explaining her decision.\nRowley also welcomed the move. He said: \u201cWe want to find out as much as we can about how and why Dawn died. I\u2019m pleased there\u2019ll be a public inquiry.\u201d Rowley continues to suffer ill health after his exposure to novichok.\nPatel said the inquiry would undertaken by Hallett alone as chair. In a letter to Hallett, Patel said: \u201cThere are a number of administrative and security details our teams will need to resolve, but I hope you will agree that we should aim to establish the inquiry as soon as is reasonably possible in 2022.\n\u201cMy officials will do all they can to support you throughout the course of the inquiry. Like you, I am keen that this inquiry keeps the family of Ms Sturgess at its heart in its pursuit to understand how she died.\u201d\nHallett welcomed the announcement and said: \u201cMy team will now work through all the necessary arrangements so the inquiry can be set up early in 2022.\u201d\nThe former Russian spy Sergei Skripal was the target of a novichok attack in Salisbury in March 2018. He and his daughter, Yulia, and a police officer, DS Nick Bailey, were poisoned but survived.\nIt is hoped that an inquiry may help to explain the gap between the attack on the Skripals and the poisoning of Sturgess.\nAt a preliminary inquest hearing in September, a Sturgess family lawyer argued that there was a wide public interest in investigating the circumstances, especially after a claim by the senior national coordinator for counter-terrorism policing, Dean Haydon, that thousands of people could have been killed in the poisonings, which the UK government blames on the Russian state.",

This weekend it elegantly commemorates the victims of Covid-19 as part of Lumiere in Durham, the UK\u2019s largest light festival.\nThe work, A Telling of Light, is by artists Elaine Buckholtz and Ian Winters and is a huge technical challenge involving about 140,000 separate points of light, in tribute to the UK death toll from coronavirus.\nThe light show is accompanied by monastic music watched from a field near to the monument, a National Trust property on the border of County Durham.\nThe soundtrack includes music written by Hildegard, considered one of the first identifiable composers in the history of western music who spent most of her life in a hilltop monastery in the Rhineland.\nBuckholtz said they were offering visitors a place to mourn but also to be inspired. \u201cSometimes it looks like a chariot in the sky. It feels like it\u2019s not reachable, but it\u2019s there. For me it speaks to the relationship between life and death.\u201d\nShe said the intention had been to create a sublime, communal experience. \u201cNo one has been able to mourn together. Everyone has been separate. A lot of people haven\u2019t even had a funeral so we wanted to create a place for people to be together and honour their losses.\u201d\nLumiere has been staged in Durham every two years since 2009. It returns on Thursday with 37 works including, for the first time, six dotted across the county.\nOne is Penshaw. Others include Solitude by Finnish artist Kari Kola at Finchale Priory, a place which was essentially a holiday retreat for the medieval monks of Durham. In Seaham marina car park Tim Etchells will delight or infuriate onlookers with a large LED text sculpture that reads \u201cGO WITH THE FLOW/SWIM AGAINST THE TIDE\u201d.\nThe festival is enormously popular even if it is a huge logistical challenge for organisers and organisations in Durham itself. Pedestrians without a ticket will not be able to get in to the centre and everywhere there are signs telling motorists to expect delays.\nThis year there has been divine help with Durham Cathedral moving its evensong to an earlier time to accommodate a vast, beautiful Mexican Day of the Dead-inspired work projected on to its facade.\nElsewhere, visitors to the city who need a free ticket \u2013 all 160,000 of which were snapped up straight away \u2013 might see small pairs of illuminated magpies (two for joy) dotted around the city on lamp-posts and signs; or a disconcerting cluster of enormous hinged desk lamps on the waterside at Framwellgate.\n\u201cEveryone who looks at them says: \u2018I want one,\u2019\u201d said Helen Marriage, director of Artichoke, which puts on Lumiere.\nMarriage said Lumiere succeeded in exhibiting challenging work to audiences who might not automatically think of going to a gallery. \u201cThe community does feel like they own it. If we were to say we\u2019re not doing it any more I think it would be like saying Christmas isn\u2019t coming any more. People expect it now.\u201d\nIncreased security measures have been introduced including bag searches, armed police and steel barriers. The UK terror alert level has been lifted to \u201csevere\u201d after the explosion outside a hospital in Liverpool.\nThe festival costs about \u00a33m but the economic boost to the region is huge. It will also help County Durham\u2019s bid to be the UK city of culture in 2025.\nMarriage said that at times it felt like a wonderful social experiment. \u201cCan you take a city and put art into its daily life? One thing I\u2019m preoccupied by is who owns public space? Is it only ever for shopping and work and traffic. My contention is that we can do so much more with it and we can bring people together.\u201d\nMarriage said the lockdowns and everything moving online over the last year had made her worry it might be the death of Lumiere. \u201cActually I think the reverse is true. People are so desperate for real experiences \u2026 I think there will be a resurgence in things people do together.\u201d",

Eddie Jones has also been forced into selecting a rookie front row with Bevan Rodd and Jamie Blamire making only their second England starts with Joe Marler, who is not due to come out of isolation until later on Thursday after testing positive for Covid-19, named on the bench.\nLawes was the favourite for the captaincy, having led the side in the victory over Tonga on 6 November when Farrell was also absent, but Marchant\u2019s selection on the right wing is somewhat of a surprise. As expected, Marcus Smith continues at fly-half with Manu Tuilagi reverting to inside-centre and Henry Slade retaining the No13 jersey. Rather than opt for Adam Radwan or Max Malins on the wing, however, Jones has opted for Marchant, who normally plies his trade at centre, in an echo of last Saturday\u2019s selections for the win over Australia.\nBlamire was expected to get the nod with Jamie George missing through injury with Nic Dolly in line for a Test debut from the bench. The 23-year-old Newcastle hooker has made just three Premiership starts, however. Though he has six tries from his four England appearances to date, the world champions \u2013 who boast a formidable front row \u2013 will prove a considerable step up. South Africa significantly outgunned England at the scrum in the 2019 World Cup final and with Rodd also making only his second Test appearance, Jones is having to put his faith in inexperience. It explains why Marler, who will not be able to train with the squad until Friday, has been included among the replacements.\nElsewhere, Kyle Sinckler starts at tighthead in the two sides\u2019 first meeting since he was knocked out in the early stages of the 2019 final while Maro Itoje and Jonny Hill continue at lock. The back row is unchanged with Sam Underhill and Tom Curry continuing at blindside. Ben Youngs is once more at scrum-half with Jonny May remaining on the left wing and the in-form Freddie Steward continuing at full-back.

We\u2019ve been really pleased with the preparation this week and how the team has continued to develop over the past month.

        "content": "The Arizona senator\u2019s flamboyant attire and ever-changing style has inspired headlines and intrigue\nThe Arizona senator Kyrsten Sinema, who memorably posted a photo of herself wearing a ring that said \u201cFuck Off\u201d, thinks it is offensive that the media keeps discussing her sartorial choices. Sinema has become a household name in recent months because of her resistance to Joe Biden\u2019s Build Back Better agenda, but her flamboyant attire and ever-changing style has also helped keep the senator in the news. She\u2019s inspired headlines such as Kyrsten Sinema\u2019s Style Keeps Us Guessing (The New York Times) and Take note, AOC \u2013 Kyrsten Sinema\u2019s bad style actually makes a statement (The New York Post).\n\u201cIt\u2019s very inappropriate,\u201d Sinema told Politico on Wednesday. \u201cI wear what I want because I like it. It\u2019s not a news story, and it\u2019s no one\u2019s business. It\u2019s not helpful to have [coverage] be positive or negative. It also implies that somehow women are dressing for someone else.\u201d\nIt doesn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019re a senator or a schoolkid, female clothing is unfairly policed. Professional women often find themselves getting scrutinized for their fashion choices in ways that their male counterparts are not. But does that mean, as Sinema seems to be suggesting, that it is automatically sexist or inappropriate to comment on what a female politician is wearing? Of course not. Fashion has always been used to make political statements and there are plenty of examples where a woman\u2019s clothing or appearance is a legitimate news story. When Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was sworn in as congresswoman, for example, she wore all-white to honour the suffragettes and Shirley Chisholm. In this instance, she was very much dressing for someone else.\nStyle can have substance. One of the most famous examples of this is Madeleine Albright who used jewelry to communicate her views when she was secretary of state. \u201cI found that jewelry had become part of my personal diplomatic arsenal,\u201d Albright has said. \u201cWhile President George HW Bush had been known for saying \u2018Read my lips\u2019, I began urging colleagues and reporters to \u2018Read my pins.\u2019\u201d\nSinema, who rarely speaks to reporters, hasn\u2019t explicitly urged anyone to \u201cread her pins\u201d, but it often seems like she wants people to pay attention to her wardrobe. Last year she wore a bright purple wig on the Senate floor; after voting she pointed at her wig, just to make sure everyone knew it was her. \u201cKyrsten is continuing to call attention to the need for all of us to stay home as much as possible and practice social distancing \u2013 which she is diligently practicing, including from her hair salon,\u201d her spokeswoman later said. So are her fashion choices no one\u2019s business, as she told Politico, or is she using them to make a political statement? I\u2019m confused.\nBut that\u2019s the Sinema effect: she\u2019s the former Green party-aligned activist who ran on a progressive policy platform then, as soon as she got into power, became one of the biggest roadblocks to getting any progressive policies passed. She\u2019s nominally a Democrat, but is so chummy with the GOP that the Republican senator John Cornyn has said he \u201cwould be surprised if Republicans tried to unseat\u201d Sinema in 2024. (He\u2019s since walked that back a little.) She\u2019s nothing if not inconsistent.\nOne reason that so much attention is paid to the senator\u2019s clothes is that people are desperate to understand what (if anything) she stands for, and clothes seem to be one of the main ways she expresses herself. Sinema seems to have forgotten that she is a public servant and that part of her job is communicating with the people she represents. She doesn\u2019t hold public events for her Arizona constituents; she doesn\u2019t communicate with the local progressive groups who got her elected or even her previous allies; she rarely gives interviews and, when she does speak to the press, says little of substance. The New York Times has described her as \u201cone of the most elusive senators on Capitol Hill\u201d; the Politico piece noted that \u201ceven after an extended interview, the first-term Democrat holds onto the air of mystery that\u2019s become a signature part of her political brand\u201d.\nSinema owes no one an explanation for how she dresses, but there are plenty of other things she owes us all an explanation for. Like whether all the money big pharma has been sending her way has anything to do with her U-turn on drug prices. Sinema campaigned on lowering drug prices and making healthcare more affordable in her 2018 Senate race; as a senator she had the opportunity to help Biden do just that but instead was instrumental in massively watering down drug pricing reforms. She hasn\u2019t given the public any details regarding this shift \u2013 just as she hasn\u2019t given the public any meaningful details on why she is raking in so much money from multilevel marketing businesses (often criticized as pyramid schemes). If Sinema wants people to focus on her work instead of her wigs, then maybe she should remember who she is supposed to be working for. If Sinema starts providing much-needed explanations about what she stands for, there might be rather less talk about the thigh-high boots she\u2019s standing in.",

Huntsmen cast the hounds to this scent, and follow it to the end of the trail.\nDominic Driver, the head of land stewardship for NRW, said: \u201cThe outcome of the court case against a senior leader of the MFHA has resulted in a loss of confidence in the organisation\u2019s ability to ensure its activities are carried out within the law and terms of its agreement.\n\u201cIn order to assure ourselves properly that trail hunting on our estate wasn\u2019t being used as a cover for illegal activity, we would have to invest in skills and resources that we currently don\u2019t have, to police it properly.\n\u201cGiven what has historically been a minor use of the land we manage, this does not represent good use of our limited resources. All trail hunting activity on the NRW-managed estate will end with immediate effect.\u201d\nLee Moon, spokesperson for the Hunt Saboteurs Association, said: \u201cThe fallout from the leaked webinars continues and these landowners now realise they\u2019ve been duped by the hunting community. It\u2019s only a matter of time before more large landowners follow suit leading to the loss of millions of acres of land and the total demise of some hunts.\u201d\nChris Luffingham, deputy chief executive of the League Against Cruel Sports, said: \u201cFor such a major landowner like Natural Resources Wales to permanently end trail hunting on its land is hugely significant.\u201d\nThe League is urging other major landowners such as Forestry England, United Utilities, the Church of England, the crown estate, the Duchy of Cornwall, local authorities, the national parks authorities, and the Ministry of Defence to permanently end hunting on their property.\nNRW was formed in April 2013, largely taking over the functions of the Countryside Council for Wales, Forestry Commission Wales and the Environment Agency in Wales.",

Maab Salah, 27, a member of the local resistance committee, said: \u201cAlmost every neighbourhood in Bahri today has a funeral. What we saw yesterday was something new.\n\u201cPolice forces from different units all took part in the repression and killing yesterday. I even saw the traffic police firing on the protesters yesterday.\u201d\nAnother protester described seeing someone shot down next to her. \u201cHis name was Abdul-Karim. I think he was in his 60s. I saw him falling down next to me. We didn\u2019t hear the sound of a bullet but he died immediately, shot in his head,\u201d said the 32-year-old former teacher, who asked not to be named.\nOthers described how doctors at hospitals in Bahri had been arrested as they tried to treat casualties, prompting doctors to treat those injured in private homes.\nPolice, however, said they had recorded only one death among protesters in north Khartoum. Another 30 had suffered breathing difficulties from teargas inhalation.\nProtesters described the behaviour of police on Wednesday as more aggressive than in the past, the latest sign that the military is looking to entrench its position. The military has said peaceful protests are allowed.\nThe coup upended a power-sharing arrangement between the military and civilian groups, put in place after Bashir\u2019s overthrow.\nCuts to internet and phone services since the coup have complicated efforts by activists to mobilise. Still, hundreds of thousands took to the streets on two days of mass protests, and thousands attended more scattered protests on Wednesday.\nThe ambassador of Norway, which together with the US and Britain is in a troika to steer western policy on Sudan, strongly condemned violence against unarmed protesters.\n\u201cHindering access to hospitals and disrupting safety and treatment in hospitals is intolerable and illegal. As is the way all communications have been shut down,\u201d Therese Loken Gheziel said in a statement.\nWith unrest continuing, police on Thursday fired teargas to disperse dozens of anti-coup protesters who had stayed on the streets of north Khartoum overnight, witnesses said. Security forces also tore down makeshift barricades the protesters had erected the previous day.\n\u201cWe condemn violence towards peaceful protesters and call for the respect and protection of human rights in Sudan,\u201d the US state department\u2019s Bureau of African Affairs said on Twitter.\nLast week, Burhan formed a new Sovereign Council, the highest transitional authority, with himself as chief and military figures and ex-rebel leaders keeping their posts. He replaced members from the Forces for Freedom and Change, Sudan\u2019s main civilian bloc, with little-known figures.\nThis week, the US assistant secretary of state for African affairs, Molly Phee, met the generals and the ousted civilian government in an attempt to broker a way out of the crisis.\nPhee has called for the reinstatement of the ousted prime minister, Abdalla Hamdok, who is effectively under house arrest.",

        "content": "Mild-mannered former centrist has become a surprise favourite to win Les R\u00e9publicains\u2019 nomination\nIn a restaurant in prosperous western Paris, fans of the EU\u2019s former negotiator on Brexit, Michel Barnier, crowded in to hear their hero speak, cheering the mild-mannered 70-year-old who has gone from rank outsider to potential favourite in the contest to choose a presidential candidate for the right\u2019s Les R\u00e9publicains.\nBarnier is one of the big surprises of the unpredictable pre-election season in France. He was known for almost 50 years in right-wing French politics as a centrist, liberal-minded neo-Gaullist, devoted to the European cause. But he has amazed observers by significantly hardening his stance as the rightwing party prepared to decide on its candidate early next month.\n\u201cThere are two conditions for things to get better in France: security and immigration,\u201d Barnier said gravely, to applause. \u201cThere is tension, a risk of confrontation \u2013 we have to restore calm and bring back quiet to people\u2019s lives. For that, we need an electroshock in terms of security and immigration.\u201d\nHe says it was last Christmas Eve, hours after the post-Brexit agreement was signed with the UK, when he declared that he missed France and wanted to be \u201cuseful\u201d in French politics, that he began pondering running for French president to beat Emmanuel Macron and, he says, reunite France\u2019s divided society.\nBarnier claims that unregulated immigration from outside the EU is weakening France\u2019s sense of identity. He believes the UK\u2019s vote to leave the EU showed how dangerous it can be when divisions in society are allowed to fester. He has promised a French moratorium of three to five years for non-European immigrants, in which even family members joining immigrants will be stopped, and has called for France to regain legal sovereignty from European Union courts. During this immigration moratorium, he said: \u201cwe will take measures to review all the procedures that are not working to make them more rigorous and fairer\u201d.\nHis detractors say it is not clear how France, a member of the EU\u2019s Schengen free movement area, could implement this without violating EU law. The left say he\u2019s chasing the far-right Marine Le Pen and another potential candidate, the far-right TV pundit Eric Zemmour. Barnier has dismissed these criticisms as \u201cpathetic\u201d and says he simply wants to improve the way things work.\nThe quest to choose a presidential candidate for Nicolas Sarkozy\u2019s traditional right-wing party Les R\u00e9publicains has certainly been defined by tough language on immigration and identity.\nNot just Barnier, but his other key competitors \u2013 the former Sarkozy ministers, Valerie P\u00e9cresse and Xavier Bertrand \u2013 have all veered from their centrist pasts to appeal to more conservative strains of the party membership. Almost 150,000 party members will decide the candidate in an internal vote, with the winner announced on 4 December. The result is impossible to predict, with 69,000 people joining or rejoining the party since September and no profile of how they might vote.\nBut ultimately it is a personality contest, and this is where Barnier has created momentum and surprise. Initially dismissed by some as too bland, he has whipped up a following who believe he is a dependable elder-statesman able to end party in-fighting and understand provincial France. A mountaineer and hiker from the Alps, who built his career in local village politics, he walks in ancient forests and reminds people he loves trees. \u201cYou can\u2019t be in politics or become president without loving trees,\u201d he recently told Paris Match. First elected aged 22 as a local councillor in Savoie, he then entered parliament aged only 27 in 1978. He served four times as a government minister and twice as EU commissioner. His supporters point out that he has won every direct vote he has stood for since the age of 22.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been a technocrat, I\u2019ve always been a politician,\u201d Barnier said in Paris. A former environment minister, and co-organiser of the 1992 Winter Olympics, he knows climate change is a concern for right-wing rural voters, and makes it personal. \u201cI come from a mountain area where one-third of the economy depends on snow,\u201d he told the restaurant crowd to applause. Famous for his devotion to spread-sheets and dossiers, he is still often seen with a trademark briefing folder wedged under his arm.\nAntoinette, 74, a retired parliamentary attache in Paris, said: \u201cWhen we were in our 20s and in parliament, I\u2019d see him at lunch \u2013 it was usually sausages \u2013 and he just stood out as friendly and decent.\u201d\nFrancis Szpiner, the Les R\u00e9publicains mayor of the 16th arrondissement of Paris, borrowed a campaign tag from the former Socialist president Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, to call Barnier \u201cthe quiet force\u201d.\nBarnier\u2019s main rivals, Bertrand and P\u00e9cresse, are higher than him in polls of the general electorate. But both left the party Les R\u00e9publicains after Macron\u2019s victory in 2017 to work on their own individual political projects. Barnier stayed \u2013 something party members take note of. \u201cIn politics, loyalty is a virtue,\u201d Szpiner said.\nAt Barnier\u2019s modern, open-plan campaign headquarters near the Elys\u00e9e Palace, a senior member of his team said: \u201cThe next two weeks are about Michel Barnier going out there to meet party members and show them how he can beat Emmanuel Macron next spring: through his standing, and the fact that he would govern differently.\u201d\nBarnier promises to serve only one term as president. He says he would contrast what he deems Macron\u2019s top-down \u201csolitary\u201d way of decision-making, by instead working with different parts of society and local government.\nOlivier Rouquan of Paris University\u2019s centre for administrative and political sciences, said of the party membership: \u201cThis is an older electorate, they know Barnier and he resembles them in many ways. He has stepped sideways from his European period in Brussels, because a part of this electorate is very focused on questions of security and immigration. That is why he has taken that turn. All the candidates have done the same. Barnier didn\u2019t want to be accused of being too moderate. But he has made an 180 degree turn, proposing to revise the constitution on immigration. Will it work? We don\u2019t know.\u201d\nColette, 75, a former hospital scientist and lifelong party member, said: \u201cFrankly, I find him stable and reassuring, and these days that\u2019s what counts.\u201d",

        "content": "With the tournament one year away we address key questions for supporters planning to travel to the finals\nEarly in the new year. Prices are yet to be revealed but a Qatar 2022 spokesperson told the Guardian that tickets would be \u201caffordable for all the family\u201d and in line with recent World Cups. For those with money to burn, executive packages are already available. These start at $950 (\u00a3707) per person for a \u201cmatch club\u201d package, which includes a group stage ticket, \u201cstreet food\u201d dining, a gift and drinks including beer and wine \u2013 while the more extravagant \u201cPearl Lounge\u201d experience, with fine dining, \u201cmixologists, Champagne selection, sommeliers, and premium spirits\u201d starts at $4,950 a head.\nA decision is yet to be made, although the expectation is that it is more likely than not. In Qatar the sale of alcohol is restricted to a few luxury hotels and is expensive at \u00a310-\u00a315 for beer or wine. However for the World Cup it will be easier to purchase and more affordable. During the 2019 Club World Cup, for instance, the Qataris experimented with a \u201cwet fan zone\u201d, with beer, wine and cider on sale for about \u00a35 \u2013 a similar plan is likely to be in place for the 2022 World Cup.\nUnder Qatari law it is an offence to be drunk in public. The hope from organisers is that fans will understand that they are in a conservative country and moderate their behaviour. The sight of England fans conducting an impromptu beer snake along Doha\u2019s Corniche is unlikely to go down well. \u201cThis is ultimately a conservative but hospitable country,\u201d says one insider. \u201cSo there has to be an understanding on both sides that people should come and have a good time, while also respecting the culture.\u201d\nWith eight stadiums within a 50-mile radius and most fans staying in Doha, there is clearly the potential for trouble. However organisers insist they are rigorously prepared for all eventualities, having attended numerous major tournaments since 2011 to learn how supporters behave at major events. They have also had a partnership with Interpol called Project Stadia since 2012, which they believe will equip them to handle any trouble. \u201cEverything has been done to make sure that it\u2019s a safe experience for fans,\u201d insists one insider.\nOrganisers expect more than a million visitors during the 28-day event, but with only 30,000 hotel rooms in the country they are having to rely on other forms of accommodation. Under a deal with Accor the French company will provide staff to manage and operate more than 60,000 rooms in apartments and villas across Qatar. The idea is that fans will get what organisers call \u201cquality accommodation at a fair price\u201d \u2013 while Qatar will not be lumbered with thousands of hotel rooms they don\u2019t need after the World Cup.\nYes. Organisers have hired two huge ships, with swimming pools and spas, which offer a combined capacity of 4,000 cabins. The expectation is that alcohol also will be available \u2013 although the supreme committee, responsible for delivery of the tournament, has nervously played down talk of \u201cparty ships\u201d and \u201cbooze cruises\u201d. Plans to allow fans to stay in luxury tents in the desert are also being worked on.\nYes. Qatar has said it will comply with Fifa rules promoting tolerance and inclusion at matches, despite its strict anti-LGBTQ+ laws. As Fifa\u2019s chief social responsibility and education officer, Joyce Cook, puts it: \u201cI\u2019m an openly gay woman in football, so this is personally something I\u2019m close to. We will see a progressive change in all of those aspects, and rainbow flags, T-shirts will all be welcome in the stadium \u2013 that\u2019s a given. They understand very well that is our stance.\u201d\nHomosexuality is illegal in Qatar, with a 2004 law stipulating imprisonment between one and three years for sodomy between men. However the Qataris have repeatedly insisted that everyone will be welcome, regardless of nationality, gender and sexual orientation. They also stress that the country has a more conservative culture and fans will be asked to respect local norms \u2013 which frowns on public displays of affection.\nYes, according to Paul Amann, the founder of Liverpool fans\u2019 group Kop Outs. Amann, who visited Qatar with his partner during the 2019 Club World Cup, said he was initially worried about going after being invited by organisers. However, what he found surprised him. \u201cIt\u2019s got a very horrific law on the statute, don\u2019t get me wrong,\u201d he says. \u201cBut my husband and I walked around Doha\u2019s Corniche, and went to the museum and visited the souk at night, we felt entirely safe. But we were respectful of the legal situation over there, which covers both heterosexuals, as well as LGBT+ people. We didn\u2019t make public displays of affection. But then we rarely do in the UK.\u201d",

        "content": "Tiny proportion of world\u2019s land surface hosts carbon-rich forests and peatlands that would not recover before 2050 if lost\nDetailed new mapping has pinpointed the carbon-rich forests and peatlands that humanity cannot afford to destroy if climate catastrophe is to be avoided.\nThe vast forests and peatlands of Russia, Canada and the US are vital, researchers found, as are tropical forests in the Amazon, Congo and south-east Asia. Peat bogs in the UK and mangrove swamps and eucalyptus forests in Australia are also on the list.\nThe scientists identified 139bn tonnes (139Gt) of carbon in trees, plants and soils as \u201cirrecoverable\u201d, meaning that natural regeneration could not replace its loss by 2050, the date by which the net global carbon emissions must end to avoid the worst impacts of global heating. In the last decade alone, farming, logging and wildfires have caused the release of at least 4Gt of irrecoverable carbon, the researchers said.\nSlashing fossil fuel burning is key to ending the climate crisis but ending the razing of forests is also crucial. Major nations including Brazil, China and the US agreed to do this by 2030 at the Cop26 climate summit, although a similar pledge made in 2014 failed.\nThe Earth\u2019s irrecoverable carbon is highly concentrated, the researchers showed. Half of it is found on just 3.3% of the world\u2019s land, making focused conservation projects highly effective. Only half the irrecoverable carbon is currently in protected areas but adding 5.4% of the world\u2019s land to these would secure 75% of irrecoverable carbon, they found.\nIndigenous peoples are the best protectors of land but only a third of irrecoverable carbon is stored on their recognised territories. Irrecoverable carbon stores overlap strongly with areas of rich wildlife, so protecting them would also tackle the looming mass extinction of wildlife.\n\u201cWe absolutely must protect this irrecoverable carbon to avert climate catastrophe \u2013 we must keep it in the ground,\u201d said Monica Noon at Conservation International, the lead author of the study. \u201cThese are the areas that really cannot be recovered in our generation \u2013 it is our generation\u2019s carbon to protect. But with irrecoverable carbon concentrated in a relatively small area of land, the world could protect the majority of these climate-essential places by 2030.\u201d\nProf Pete Smith, at the University of Aberdeen in the UK, said: \u201cThis research makes a convincing case for where, and how, to focus efforts for the \u201830 by 30\u2019 initiatives already in existence\u201d to protect 30% of land by 2030.\nThe research, published in the journal Nature Sustainability, found that 57% of irrecoverable carbon was in trees and plants and 43% was in soils, especially peat. Global peatlands store more carbon than tropical and subtropical forests, it concluded.\nThe tropical forests and peatlands of the Amazon are the biggest store of irrecoverable carbon. These were recently reported as emitting more carbon than they absorb. The boreal peatlands and forests of eastern Canada and western Siberia, and the rainforests islands of south-east Asia, are the next largest. The temperate rainforest of north-west North America, mangroves and tidal wetlands around the world, and the Congo basin are also major stores.\nRussia hosts the biggest store of irrecoverable carbon \u2013 23% \u2013 and has been hit by wildfires in recent years. Brazil is second, where Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s government has allowed a sharp rise in deforestation. Canada is third and the US fifth: together these two countries have 14% of the world\u2019s irrecoverable carbon, but they have also lost forests to wildfires, pests and logging. The wetlands of southern Florida are another important store of irrecoverable carbon.\nAustralia is home to 2.5% of the world\u2019s irrecoverable carbon, in its coastal mangroves and seagrasses as well as forests in the south-east and south-west, which were hit by megafires in 2019-20. In the UK, peat bogs cover 2m hectares and have stored 230m tonnes of irrecoverable carbon for millennia, but most are in poor condition.\nThe scientists calculated the amount and location of irrecoverable carbon by first identifying at high resolution those areas where direct human activity could damage natural ecosystems. These included forests and peat wetlands, but excluded permafrost regions and commercial tree plantations.\nNext the scientists assessed the total amount of carbon stored in the trees, plants and soils in the included areas. Finally, they estimated how much carbon could be recovered by natural regeneration over 30 years if the forests or wetlands were destroyed.\nThe difference between the total carbon and recoverable carbon gave the amount of irrecoverable carbon. Losing this irrecoverable carbon would blow the carbon budget needed to have a two-thirds chance of staying under 1.5C of global heating.\nPeatlands and mangroves are hotspots of irrecoverable carbon, due to their high carbon density and long recovery times of centuries or more. Tropical forests are less dense in carbon and regrow relatively fast, but remain critical because of the very large areas they cover.\nThe scientists said protecting irrecoverable carbon must involve strengthening the rights of indigenous peoples, ending the policies that enable destruction and expanding protected areas.\nRob Field, a conservation scientist at the RSPB in the UK, said: \u201cProtection of irrecoverable carbon, coupled with widespread decarbonisation of the world\u2019s economies, will make a safe climate more likely, at the same time as conserving important areas for biodiversity.\u201d",

        "content": "Despite the presence of an unusually menacing Benedict Cumberbatch unnerving all on set, it\u2019s this young Australian actor\u2019s otherworldly stillness that lights up Jane Campion\u2019s western psychodrama\nJane Campion\u2019s psycho-sexual western The Power of the Dog is a tremendous film but it is the power of Kodi Smit-McPhee that really adds bite to its bark. The 25-year-old Australian actor has been a fragile, hypnotic presence, with an eerie knack for stillness and intensity, ever since his earliest performances. At the age of 10, he played a boy coping with the desertion of one parent and the breakdown of the other in Romulus, My Father. At 12, he trudged through a post-apocalyptic hell-scape in The Road, then fell in love with a vampire at 13 in Let Me In, the US remake of the Swedish horror hit Let the Right One In. Even his multiplex movies, such as the X-Men outings (Apocalypse and Dark Phoenix) in which he played the blue-skinned Nightcrawler, have felt that bit stranger thanks to his delicate, androgynous features and those pool-sized anime eyes set far apart on his face.\nHis uncanny quality is crucial to Campion\u2019s movie, which is set in early 2oth-century Montana. Smit-McPhee plays the gangly, effeminate Peter, who spends his days crafting intricate paper flowers and sketching dead animals. His life is destabilised when his mother (Kirsten Dunst), a widowed innkeeper, takes up with a new partner. It is not this stepfather (Jesse Plemons) who poses a threat so much as his sadistic, bullying brother Phil (Benedict Cumberbatch), who taunts Peter and mocks the way he \u201ccreeps all over the place, big eyes goggling\u201d.\nFor our video call, the actor is seated in front of an image of the mountain landscape that dominates the film, although his outfit today is more fop than cowboy: a cream roll neck under a beige leather jerkin festooned with flaps and pockets. His answers arrive in a sombre monotone; he sits static and upright, hands folded in his lap. Were his lips not moving, it might seem as if the screen had frozen. Perhaps his posture is a necessary response to the painful inflammatory condition from which he suffers: ankylosing spondylitis. \u201cShall I just let you try and say it?\u201d he teases after I mangle the pronunciation. Then he changes tack sweetly: \u201cYou can just call it AS.\u201d\nSmit-McPhee was a proponent of the still-waters-run-deep school of acting long before his AS diagnosis at 16. His single-minded concentration is part of what results in such transfixing performances. A case in point is the most glorious scene in The Power of the Dog: Peter\u2019s bouncy, lolloping walk from one end of the haymaking camp to the other, past rows of macho cowboys who are wolf-whistling and cat-calling and hollering homophobic abuse, none of which does anything to arrest his progress or dim his defiance. This apparently undramatic stroll, which occurs roughly halfway through the film, changes the course of the entire story.\n\u201cI love that,\u201d he says. \u201cI call it the catwalk scene. It shows Peter\u2019s unwavering spirit in the face of all that judgment. He is in an isolated environment so he\u2019s never had to repress anything in front of anyone. Phil hasn\u2019t had that freedom, so he has solidified into this very toxic personality.\u201d I ask how it felt emotionally to perform that walk, but he shoots me down. \u201cI can only tell you how Peter felt. There\u2019s no narrative there of what Kodi\u2019s feeling. If there was, I wouldn\u2019t be in the moment.\u201d Fair enough.\nCumberbatch was the one cast member who stayed in character between takes, although that had a trickle-down effect on everyone else. \u201cPhil is so hostile that just being in his presence, we all felt it,\u201d says Smit-McPhee. \u201cThat\u2019s the idea behind Benedict going method. He\u2019s an apologetic sweetheart Englishman, and we couldn\u2019t have that guy anywhere near the set. We needed Phil there.\u201d When did he get to meet the real Cumberbatch? \u201cOh, there were a few times when he would surface with a giggle, then snap back. Also, it was Benedict who was there during the two weeks of rehearsals, as was Kodi.\u201d\nSmit-McPhee\u2019s use of the third person stops seeming odd eventually, just as you also become accustomed to him referring to himself as an \u201cartist\u201d or mentioning several times his interest in \u201cphilosophy, science, quantum physics\u201d and \u201cesoteric hidden knowledge like mythology and alchemy and all that fancy stuff\u201d. On screen, he can come across as ageless or spookily wise: a thin, pale sage. The best in the business have had to raise their game in his presence. Not just Cumberbatch but Eric Bana (in Romulus, My Father), Viggo Mortensen (The Road), Michael Fassbender (Slow West). So it is nice to be reminded in conversation \u2013 when he refers to \u201call the achievements I have under my belt\u201d or \u201cthe inspiration I take as an artist from the primordial soup of stories that predate us\u201d\u2013 that he is, after all, only 25.\n\u201cI find parallels between Peter and myself,\u201d he says. \u201cWe don\u2019t necessarily fit in the generalised boxes of society, and there are sides to him that I need to reinforce in my own life; his power and his confidence in who he is. He\u2019s not living up to the expectations of what masculinity and strength are to other people.\u201d Some of the pressure that Smit-McPhee has felt about his own masculinity came from looking at his father, the wrestler-turned-actor Andy McPhee, who got him into the industry in the first place. His dad already had a career in Australian television when he encouraged him and his sister to try acting. Once Smit-McPhee\u2019s career began to take off spectacularly, the family decamped to the US.\n\u201cMy dad has always been my coach and my mentor,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are so close. But he\u2019s 6ft 6in, he\u2019s got a goatee, he has ridden with outlaw motorcycle clubs most of his life. As I started to approach adolescence, I wondered when I was going to bloom into this masculine thing. Do I have to go to the gym? Do I have to speak a different way? One day there was a bit of a breakthrough and I realised I don\u2019t have to be any of that. I\u2019m an ectomorph. I\u2019m interested in philosophy. I\u2019m an artist, and that\u2019s beautiful. Peter helped me discover that it\u2019s OK not to fit into that masculine box. You can still be strong, no matter how you look and carry yourself.\u201d\nHas he confronted his father about this? \u201cYeah. One day we got into a father-son thing, clashing heads a bit, and it just happened that I ended up saying I wasn\u2019t going to be like him. He said he never wanted that; he just wanted me to have street smarts and to protect myself. He broke down a bit and said: \u2018You\u2019re my boy, you\u2019re perfect, you don\u2019t have to be anything that I am.\u2019 It was a beautiful transition point for both of us.\u201d\nThere has been another change in his life recently, one which comes up when I ask about the \u201c777\u201d tattoo on his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s an angelic number,\u201d he says. \u201cIt represents God for many but for me it was to mark a point of transition in my life. I can\u2019t say what because it\u2019s so personal to me but I think everyone can relate to it. You get to that point in your life where you realise you\u2019ve become stagnant. You just need to grow and change, and then you cut off certain people.\u201d\nWhoa. That sounds brutal. Are we talking about something traumatic? \u201cNot really, it\u2019s just what tends to happen in LA or any big city I guess. I was around many of the same people who maybe seven years ago were necessary to my life, and yet now you find it\u2019s a very surface-level relationship. I\u2019m someone who needs to keep evolving in my craft, my personal life, my health, and I found those people weren\u2019t doing that for me. It\u2019s not to blame them or whatever journey they are on. It\u2019s just about cutting ties in a healthy way.\u201d\nAnyone who sees The Power of the Dog will recognise this as very Peter-like behaviour. Whomever it was that Kodi Smit-McPhee expunged from his life can at least console themselves that the event was momentous enough to be marked with a commemorative tattoo. No one could accuse him of taking it lightly. Taking things lightly just isn\u2019t his style.\n The Power of the Dog is in cinemas from 19 November and on Netflix from 1 December.",

        "content": "Youngest manager in the top four tiers on his unbreakable philosophy, \u2018tasty\u2019 five-a-sides at the leisure centre and Cop26\nIt is fair to say the standard of the Wednesday five-a-side league has improved of late at Penyrheol Leisure Centre, where Swansea supporters have been duelling with familiar faces, including the head coach, Russell Martin, and the technical coach, Matt Gill. Unsurprisingly, the staff team are top of the league, set up by the longstanding groundsman at the club\u2019s Fairwood training base, Kevin Roberts, who usually assumes the role of referee. \u201cI told off our kit man, Mike, for playing too many Hollywood passes last week,\u201d says Martin, laughing. \u201c\u2018Just keep it simple!\u2019 He was fuming. We play the Swans way.\u201d\nOver the years, Roberto Mart\u00ednez, Brendan Rodgers, Michael Laudrup and Graham Potter set up Swansea to dominate. Martin, too, believes in a possession-based style and fans are enjoying what they are seeing. The team have had a greater share of possession in every Championship game this season \u2013 only Potter\u2019s Brighton enjoyed more of the ball against them, in September\u2019s Carabao Cup match \u2013 and in victory against Peterborough last month they completed 779 passes. They average 537 short passes a game \u2013 almost double the tally of Saturday\u2019s visitors, Blackpool \u2013 but Martin knows not everyone agrees with his thinking despite four wins in the past six matches. \u201cIf you don\u2019t believe in what we\u2019re doing, no problem, but we really do,\u201d he says.\nThey rank first in the division for forward passes and successful passes into the final third but one of the biggest things, Martin says, is \u201cball speed\u201d and keeping the ball in play \u2013 they have for a league-high 54 minutes, four more than the average. \u201cYou always get people who say \u2018possession doesn\u2019t mean you win\u2019, but if you have the ball and you have it a long way from your goal, your chances of conceding become much smaller,\u201d says the 35-year-old, the youngest manager in the top four tiers. \u201cFor us, it is about taking as much fight out of the game as we can and controlling it with the football.\u201d\nIn March his MK Dons team set a British record, since such records began, for the most consecutive passes leading to a goal, Will Grigg rounding off a 56-pass move. A week later, a video of Martin staunchly reiterating his desire to polish plan A rather than adopt a plan B went viral. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t work and I get sacked, at least I get sacked doing something I believe in. I don\u2019t get sacked regretting that I have bowed on my principles.\u201d\nThe clip has chalked up almost 400,000 views. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a big deal to me \u2013 it was just common sense. It helped us build a bit of siege mentality. It was like: \u2018Look, no one believes we can do this and no one wants us to be successful doing this.\u2019 It\u2019s the British mentality towards football. Traditionally, it\u2019s been about rolling your sleeves and fighting but, slowly but surely, it\u2019s changing.\u201d\nHis impressive work in League One led Swansea to come calling in the summer. He spoke to Potter and Owain Tudur Jones, with whom he played at Norwich, before moving his family to south Wales. \u201cWe\u2019re loving it. I swim in the sea as much as I can, after training or on days off.\u201d His 10-year-old, Reno, has joined Swansea\u2019s academy and his youngest, Leo, is in the pre-academy with the midfielder Korey Smith\u2019s eldest and the former winger Nathan Dyer\u2019s son. \u201cIf you\u2019re coaching an under-six, the first thing you want them to do is get them comfortable with the ball. It\u2019s not run, it\u2019s not run the channel, it\u2019s not kick it really far, it\u2019s not ping it or shoot, it\u2019s try and control the ball with two feet. That principle, as basic as it sounds, is the same here.\u201d\nMartin is engaging company. Conversation spans from asking MK Dons to invest in recycling bins to Marcus Rashford pushing the envelope and Cop26 appearing a box-ticking exercise. \u201cThere were two weeks of lots of conversation but without much consequence. It was like: \u2018We\u2019ll get together in this room, we\u2019ll chat about it, show people we care and then we\u2019ll just see what happens.\u2019 That tends to be the way of leaders at the minute. When you have the opportunity to try, at least show people you are really trying.\u201d\nAt least it seems football is prepared to tackle big issues, be it the climate crisis, racism or human rights. It is something Martin has tried to tackle on a personal level through his foundation, which uses football to address wider social issues.\n\u201cFootballers have been told for so long: \u2018You\u2019re role models, you have to behave properly.\u2019 But when they put their head above the parapet and say something that some people don\u2019t agree with, it\u2019s like: \u2018No, no, no you\u2019re a footballer, put yourself back in your box.\u2019 When the footballers are showing a lot more decency than the prime minister and a lot of the government officials, then there is a bit of a problem.\n\u201cTalking about politics now, I\u2019m getting angry,\u201d he says, and so conversation turns back to football. After all, there is an 8pm kick-off in the Phil Owen Memorial League on the horizon. This week they won 10-4. \u201cWe go one-nil up and keep the ball for ever,\u201d he says. \u201cIt can get a bit tasty. But I enjoy it. This is such a good place in terms of the people, how friendly they are, how supportive they have been. I think they can see we\u2019re trying to do something that is really aligned with what the club has done previously, in its modern history.\u201d",

The \u201cperpetrator-focused approach is currently being piloted in Avon and Somerset and involves attempting to disrupt and track suspected sex offenders including rapists, instead of focusing on the credibility of victims.\nBlyth was appointed in September after a highly critical report from the police watchdog, which warned that England and Wales was facing a \u201cnational epidemic of violence against women and girls\u201d.\nShe told officers at the conference that police needed to act quickly to rebuild trust and said there were \u201cimmediate police improvements that mean that action is needed in the next few weeks straight away\u201d.\nThe police were \u201cvery much in listening mode, and that\u2019s really important \u2026 because of the dip in trust and confidence,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cWe won\u2019t move forward at all in any of our policing work and our wider partnership work on violence against women and girls if we don\u2019t make a change and rebuild that trust that we know has been broken through some of the tragic events of the last few weeks and months.\u201d That work had to focus on \u201cculture and conduct and behaviour\u201d, she added.\nDuring a panel discussion on violence against women and girls, which noted that \u201cthe murder of Sarah Everard by a serving police officer has prompted widespread concerns about women\u2019s safety and male violence, as well as raising serious questions about culture, vetting and recruitment across the service\u201d, the victims\u2019 commissioner, Dame Vera Baird, made a direct challenge to the assembled officers.\nShe said the treatment of violence against women and girls in the police had \u201cno central direction, no central resourcing, but it does kill a woman every three days\u201d.\nBaird called for a overhaul in police culture, for more status to be given to officers specialised in tackling violence against women and for VAWG to become a strategic policing priority, like terrorism, to give the issue central direction and extra resources, particularly for specialist officers.\n\u201cAsk yourselves, after 30 reports and 30 years of women\u2019s voices raised against violence against women and girls: why are you still not policing it properly?\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t you owe it to the public to see that and to change culturally around by 180 degrees and start to lead us out of this epidemic of violence against women and girls?\u201d\nIt comes after a YouGov poll, on behalf of the End Violence Against Women (EVAW) coalition, found 47% of women and 40% of men said their trust in the police had dropped since the conviction of Everard\u2019s killer, Wayne Couzens. About one in three said they continued to trust the police.\nEVAW\u2019s director, Andrea Simon, told officers: \u201cWe are concerned \u2026 there has been a comparatively swift leap towards various initiatives which seem aimed at improving public perception of policing, before substantive transformation and improvement in our criminal justice response has taken place.\u201d",

        "content": "Analysis: It\u2019s hard to see why northern England should be grateful for this revival of old, discarded schemes\nFor many people in the north of England, the integrated rail review heralds less of a rail revolution than a rail betrayal.\nThere will be relief among those whose houses were due to be bulldozed to make way for HS2\u2019s eastern spur, as well as those who always viewed that project as an unforgivable waste of money that would primarily benefit London.\nBut good luck finding many people who welcome the government\u2019s downgrading of Northern Powerhouse Rail (NPR), which should have been a new east-west line connecting the north\u2019s key cities.\nPerhaps it is due to the planners never getting as far as sending compulsory purchase letters to properties obstructing the route or disturbing Peak District bats. But everyone who has had the misfortune of relying on the northern railways will agree that massive investment is needed to improve reliability and journey times.\nAnd, crucially, there is a need to increase capacity. Even the petrolheads who would happily tarmac the Pennine Way would probably vote for NPR because it would stop the M62 becoming more of a car park than a motorway during the rush hour. Train lines are already full, with demand projected to increase by between 78% and 200% by 2050.\nSlow-moving freight trains often hold up passenger services and small local services are severely constrained by sharing track with faster mainline services, which take priority three times an hour.\nThe government is trying to spin the idea that its latest plans are better than the ones it promised years ago, because they will allow passengers to see quicker improvements. But much of the \u201cnew\u201d rail review simply exhumes old schemes from the graveyard of broken pledges. Given that it was the Conservative government that cancelled plans to electrify the Midlands mainline and TransPennine route in 2017, breaking 2015 manifesto commitments, it is difficult to see why the north should be grateful to see both projects back on the table.\nThe 2019 manifesto said: \u201cWe will build Northern Powerhouse Rail between Leeds and Manchester and then focus on Liverpool, Tees Valley, Hull, Sheffield and Newcastle.\u201d\nSome may question if ministers can claim to be \u201cbuilding\u201d a new line if all they are doing is constructing a little bit of new track and then carrying out an upgrade that was promised six years ago.\nAnd what about poor old Bradford, a city of missed opportunity? The fifth largest metropolitan authority in England, it has a growing population of 542,100. A total of 26.3% of the population are aged under 18, compared with 21.4% nationally, making it the youngest city in the UK. Yet no trains run through Bradford. They all stop and turn around again, at one of the two tiny stations.\nIt is a cul-de-sac of more than half a million people. Currently, the 10-mile journey from Bradford to Leeds takes 20 minutes on the fastest service. But you can travel 38 miles to London from Reading (population: 220,000) in 24 minutes.\nIn fairness, the government never promised Bradford an NPR stop, despite it being a key demand from Transport for the North (TfN), the strategic body set up by the Conservatives to advise the government on the region\u2019s transport needs \u2013 and then consistently ignored.\nIt now says simply electrifying the line to Leeds will cut the journey time to a more sensible 12 minutes.\nIt is possible party politics could have come into play. Bradford\u2019s three inner-city MPs are Labour, with two Tories in the outer seats of Shipley and Keighley, represented by the backbenchers Philip Davies and the newcomer Robbie Moore. It is worth bearing in mind an article written by the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, in the Yorkshire Post in 2017, when he was still a backbencher, which said: \u201cLondon has Crossrail, the Midlands is getting HS2, and now we in the north need the government to back Northern Powerhouse Rail.\u201d\nVoters should probably know that when the government boasts of investing \u00a3360m in smart ticketing, it cancelled Transport for the North\u2019s project to do just that in the north (but for less than half the price) earlier this year. And while it can find no money to fund a modern station in Bradford, it is willing to pay to explore restoring a passenger service to Stocksbridge, a former steel town near Sheffield, which is home to fewer than 10,000 people.\nIt just so happens Stocksbridge returned its first Tory MP since 1935 in the last general election.",

So are you going to be a naughty guy?\u201d he asked, with a chuckle at the end.\nWang said people of his age in China saw Australia as a peace lover, \u201cbut nowadays people know that a nuclear-powered submarine is designed to launch long-range attack against a target far away\u201d.\n\u201cSo who are you going to attack? You are no longer a peace lover, a peace defender, you become a sabre wielder in certain form,\u201d he said.\nChina is rapidly modernising its own military force, and already has the largest navy in the world with a battle force of about 355 ships and submarines, according to a Pentagon report last month. China currently operates 12 nuclear-powered submarines and, like the US, is a nuclear weapons state.\nThe Australian foreign minister, Marise Payne, has sought to allay Malaysia and Indonesia\u2019s concerns about Aukus, travelling to south-east Asia earlier this month to say Australia was \u201cone of the world\u2019s strongest proponents of the global non-proliferation regime\u201d and would work with the International Atomic Energy Agency.\nPayne reassured her south-east Asian counterparts that Aukus would \u201cmake us a more capable partner that is better able to contribute to the security and stability of our region\u201d.\nBut Wang described the Aukus deal among Australia, the US and the UK as an \u201cAnglo-Saxon clique\u201d, saying it \u201cshows that certain people in your country still have a mentality of concentric stratification of people according to their cultural and ethnic background\u201d.\nWang has been serving as the charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires \u2013 the top ranked diplomat \u2013 at the Chinese embassy since the beginning of November, after the former ambassador, Cheng Jingye, returned to Beijing at the end of a five-year posting.\nWang, who was already in Canberra as the deputy head of mission at the embassy, said he was saddened and disappointed at how the relationship had deteriorated over the past five years.\nSitting down for an interview at the ambassador\u2019s residence, Wang blamed \u201cnegative policies and actions from Australia against China\u201d that had been implemented in a \u201cruthless and arbitrary way\u201d.\nHe cited the banning of Chinese company Huawei from the 5G network in 2018, the cancellation of the Victorian Belt and Road Agreement earlier this year, and increased barriers to foreign investment that had \u201cscared away\u201d Chinese investors.\nThe Morrison government will soon consider the future of a Chinese company\u2019s 99-year lease of the Port of Darwin, in a move that could further strain the relationship.\nWang said under the existing contract, signed between Landbridge and the Northern Territory government in 2015, the company was planning to expand the capacity of the port.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the [Australian] intelligence and the security apparatus would stretch its hand, again, to a normal business operation,\u201d he said.\nHe said the Chinese government would respond to any decision once announced, just as it had responded to \u201call the negative moves\u201d to date.\n\u201cBut it seems to me that all these responses have fallen on deaf ears, so nobody in the government seems to be listening carefully about what my government have expressed, and even in certain areas it seems the tensions are still going on.\u201d\nAustralia has accused China of a campaign of \u201ceconomic coercion\u201d after Beijing imposed tariffs and other trade actions on a range of Australian export sectors over the past 18 months, including coal, barley, wine and seafood.\nWang continued to defend those measures on technical grounds, and said there was \u201cinadequate diplomacy that\u2019s been executed by your government in terms of solving these differences\u201d.\nHe said Chinese and Australian officials continued to speak to one another, but ministerial talks would require a better \u201cpolitical atmosphere\u201d and the prospect of \u201cconcrete results\u201d.\nIn a more upbeat outlook on the way forward, Wang said China was \u201cstill very keen to engage in a very fruitful and constructive dialogue and troubleshooting process to get all these problems solved in the end\u201d.\nHowever, one of the most sensitive issues in the relationship is Taiwan, with Australia raising concerns about an increase in Chinese military pressure against the democratically ruled island of 24 million people, amid Beijing\u2019s long-term goal of unification.\nDutton told the Australian newspaper last week: \u201cIt would be inconceivable that we wouldn\u2019t support the US in an action if the US chose to take that action.\u201d\nResponding to Dutton, Wang said Australian politicians should \u201cnot to do anything that would lead to an even more gloomy state of our relationship\u201d.\nWang said the former Australian prime minister Tony Abbott\u2019s visit to Taiwan last month was \u201cvery unfortunate\u201d. Abbott \u2013 who said he travelled in a private capacity \u2013 warned that Beijing might lash out against Taiwan soon, and the US and Australia could not stand idly by.\nWang said: \u201cActually, it is very agonising to see that such a high-level politician would engage in something that doesn\u2019t serve the interests of Australia, because I think it serves the interests of Australia and China to stick to one-China policy and make our relationship as trouble-free as possible.\u201d",

One of the people involved in the campaign is Australian film producer Bob Weis.\nHewson says the organisation intends to fundraise before next year\u2019s federal election campaign \u201cdrawing on the fairly significant base of people who will fund this sort of activity, focusing on the big issues that matter to our democracy\u201d.\n\u201cI think one of the big issues right now that has been building for a lot of different reasons since the last election has been the whole issue of integrity and accountability in government,\u201d Hewson said.\nThe former Liberal leader said the Morrison government had failed to produce a credible model for a federal integrity commission over this parliamentary term. \u201cThey are just playing games with that \u2013 which is pretty offensive.\u201d\nHewson said the prime minister was now facing sustained questioning \u201cabout whether he is telling the truth\u201d. He said pre-election contentions the prime minister had made this week about the Labor party increasing the cost of petrol or increasing energy prices lacked factual underpinning.\n\u201cThere is no evidence at all to support any of this stuff,\u201d Hewson said.\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nClimate 200, the group established by the climate activist Simon Holmes \u00e0 Court, has raised $3.6m over the past few months. With government MPs being targeted by activists in blue ribbon seats, the Liberal senator Andrew Bragg has already written to the Australian Electoral Commission asking for a probe of the \u201cvoices\u201d movements that are organising independent campaigns.\nHewson said he and Jones had worked with Holmes \u00e0 Court and \u201cI\u2019ve done a fair bit of work supporting the voices movement\u201d.\nThe former Liberal leader said it was likely the next federal election could result in a hung parliament with independents holding the balance of power. Many independents contesting the election were running on platforms of climate action, integrity and accountability.\n\u201cIt all comes together. That\u2019s the over-arching issue,\u201d he said.\n\u201cYou can see how the independents could hold the balance of power within that over-arching element of integrity and accountability, and the key elements of policies like climate and so on.\u201d\n\u201cA loose alliance of independents could say to whoever is in government, unless you give us responsible legislation in these areas then we are not going to support you \u2013 I think that will drive to better government.\u201d\nIn a statement posted on the group\u2019s website, Jones says he has joined Hewson as a patron of the Truth and Integrity project \u201cbecause democracy is under serious threat and both the Coalition and the federal ALP have no vision beyond the election of 2022\u201d.\n\u201cOnly an active citizenry can prevent sliding towards authoritarian or populist democracy with its endless appeals to the short term and self-interest,\u201d Jones says.",

It\u2019s imposed on the modelling without any justification, but it offsets a substantial amount of emissions.\n\u201cThese are extraordinary numbers to have in a report without any justification of how this would work, how it would happen and what the costs would be.\u201d\nTim Baxter, a senior researcher at the Climate Council, said the inclusion of BECCS in the government\u2019s modelling was a \u201cfarce\u201d.\n\u201cThe pretence that BECCS will get off the ground at this scale in Australia without careful, intelligent planning is absurd,\u201d he said.\nChief executive of Climate Analytics, Bill Hare, said BECCS will \u201clikely work\u201d but wasn\u2019t yet proven at scale anywhere in the world.\nThere has been little research carried out into the potential for BECCS in Australia. One study, published in 2018, did suggest a potential 25Mt of CO2 could be stored a year by 2050 through BECCS.\nBut the research, from the University of Melbourne, was based on sourcing waste biomass \u201cto avoid the ecological uncertainties and social challenges of dedicated energy crops.\u201d\nA co-author of that study, Prof Peter Cook, who also consults to industry and government on carbon capture and storage (CCS), said he was not aware of any BECCS projects in Australia and only a small number overseas where government incentives were being provided.\nHe said a challenge of combining bioenergy with CCS \u2013 which is among the government\u2019s priority technologies \u2013 is \u201cyou can\u2019t do it everywhere, you need the right rocks or you have to pipe [the CO2] a long way.\u201d\nHe said BECCS was feasible and was among several technologies that would be needed in the future to pull CO2 out of the atmosphere.\nBut he added: \u201cBut it\u2019s much better if we stop putting CO2 in the atmosphere in the first place.\u201d\nOn Thursday, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency released a roadmap to show the growth potential for the bioenergy industry in Australia.\nThere was no mention of combining bioenergy with CCS. But the roadmap said growing the bioenergy industry could cut emissions, divert waste from landfill, and improve the nation\u2019s fuel security.\nGuardian Australia asked emissions reduction minister Angus Taylor how the emissions reductions from BECCS were calculated for the report, why it wasn\u2019t a priority technology, and where the government thought the biomass would be sourced from.\nA spokesperson for the minister said in a statement: \u201cConsistent with other long term emissions modelling exercises, including work by the [International Energy Agency] and US, the [Global Trade and Environmental Model] includes BECCS.\n\u201cAnalysis by McKinsey does not include BECCS and achieves a similar net emissions outcome to the GTEM model. This illustrates that there are a range of technologies that will contribute to Australia achieving net zero emissions by 2050.\u201d",

The pledge, made near the height of the recent drought, has been dogged by planning delays and a tripling in cost to about more than $2bn, stoking doubts it would ever be implemented.\nThis week, Wyangala spilled billions of litres into the already swollen Lachlan River, exacerbating flooding downstream, and contributing to the millions of dollars in crop damage.\nScott Darcy, a wheat and canola farmer outside Forbes, said the flooding proved the project has \u201cgot to be done. Our population is getting bigger every year and we need water security.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be shocking for us after this flood. We lose half a million dollars. If you\u2019re a shop owner you lose twenty grand \u2013 it hurts,\u201d Darcy said. \u201cFor us, it\u2019s machine payments, infrastructure, new fences [as well as] making sure you have enough money for food and paying bills.\u201d\nNSW premier Dominic Perrottet, who visited flooded regions on Thursday, told Guardian Australia the raising of the dam wall would be \u201ccritical infrastructure that keeps communities safe\u201d. Still, it would be necessary to \u201cwork through\u201d the cost of the project.\nThe project originally had a price tag of $650m. But as the Guardian reported in 2020, the estimates for building the dam had risen to as much as $1.5bn because of the soaring costs of biodiversity offsets. Earlier this year, the Sydney Morning Herald reported the cost could blow out further to $2.1bn.\n\u201cOnce we\u2019ve got all the reports in front of us we\u2019ll be continuing our discussions with the federal government to get these projects moving,\u201d Perrottet said. Half of the funds are supposed to come from the commonwealth.\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nPhyllis Miller, the mayor of Forbes, said the raising of the wall should proceed whatever the cost.\n\u201cWe have for many, many years not increased our dam capacity in Australia. It\u2019s about time we did,\u201d Miller said. \u201cWe need much more control over the dam.\u201d\nHowever, environmental experts believe there are cheaper ways to manage flood risk.\nJamie Pittock, professor at the Fenner School of Environment and Society at the Australian National University, said flood \u201ccontrol\u201d infrastructure typically makes flood damage worse, not better.\n\u201cAn egregious Australian example is that the flood control capacity built into the Wivenhoe Dam in Queensland after the 1974 floods was insufficient to prevent extensive damage in the 2011 Brisbane floods because too much development was permitted in the floodplain,\u201d Pittock said. \u201cIn general, learning to live with floods is safer than fighting floods and failing.\u201d\nIn the Lachlan River case, impacts have been made worse because the state government had failed to implement its own three Floodplain Management Plans. These recommended against building roads, railways and even irrigation canal embankments in floodplains that diverted flows and made floods worse.\nOne example was the government\u2019s Lachlan River Gooloogong to Jemalong Gap Floodplain Management Plan from 2011 that identified the Forbes/Stockinbingal railway as \u201ca major restriction to flood flows\u201d.\nMedium-sized floods like the current one also bring important socio-economic and environmental benefits that would be lost if a higher dam captured a lot more water.\n\u201cCrucially in a dry region, the inundation of the floodplain is vital for recharging aquifers that supply farms and towns with high quality water,\u201d in addition to the benefits inundation brings wetland ecosystems, recreational activities and pastoralists in the area, he said.\n\u201cThe proposal to raise Wyangala Dam is a kneejerk, pork-barrelling proposal that will fail any independent cost-benefit analysis,\u201d Pittock said, adding that with climate change likely to exacerbate the swings between drought and floods, \u201cgiving rivers room to flood safely, will provide more benefits to society in the long term\u201d.\nA spokesperson for NSW\u2019s Minister for Water, Property and Housing, Melinda Pavey, affirmed the government\u2019s commitment to the project.\n\u201cThe Wyangala Dam wall-raising is a critical piece of infrastructure that will support the community for generations to come, so it\u2019s important we invest the time now in planning for its success,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\u201cDespite the impact of Covid lockdowns, the government is committed to completing the Final Business Case and Environmental Impact Statement as quickly as possible,\u201d the spokesperson said.",

        "content": "Azeem Rafiq has apologised after it was revealed he had sent antisemitic messages to a fellow cricketer more than a decade ago.\nThe former Yorkshire spin bowler has won widespread praise for his resolve and courage in exposing the issue of racial discrimination in cricket and appeared before a parliamentary select committee this week to reveal his own bitter experiences during his playing days at Headingley.\nThe 30-year-old named a number of high-profile individuals during his Westminster appearance but, on Thursday, he was forced to confront his own shortcomings in the past when The Times (\u00a3) uncovered an exchange with former Warwickshire and Leicestershire player Ateeq Javid.\nHistorical messages with Javid were revealed when the then 19-year-old Rafiq accused a third player of being reluctant to spend money at a team dinner because \u201che is a Jew\u201d.\nHe added the player would \u201cprobs go after my 2nds [second helping of food] again ha\u201d, adding: \u201cOnly Jews do tht [sic] sort of shit.\u201d\nThe timing of the revelations come during a watershed week for the sport when it has been forced to confront its attitudes towards racism and bullying, following Rafiq\u2019s testimony. Apologising for the incident, Rafiq said on Twitter: \u201cI was sent an image of this exchange from early 2011 today. I have gone back to check my account and it is me \u2013 I have absolutely no excuses.\npic.twitter.com/g4I9I5wbem\n\u201cI am ashamed of this exchange and have now deleted it so as not to cause further offence. I was 19 at the time and I hope and believe I am a different person today. I am incredibly angry at myself and I apologise to the Jewish community and everyone who is rightly offended by this.\u201d\nThe development and the timing of the news will be a source of deep embarrassment to Rafiq who this month settled an employment tribunal with Yorkshire but has vowed to stand alongside other victims of abuse and use his platform to become the \u201cvoice of the voiceless\u201d.\nSpeaking to BBC Sport after his appearance in front of the parliamentary DCMS committee, he told victims of discrimination: \u201cWhether anyone else stands by you or not, I\u2019ll stand by you. Hopefully people will be believed and heard a lot more and people can take confidence from that.\u201d He also predicted that his case would lead to the \u201cfloodgates\u201d opening and that the number of cricketers coming forward to tell their stories could run into the thousands.\nThe co-chief executive of the Jewish Leadership Council Claudia Mendoza said Rafiq\u2019s apology was \u201cmassively awkward\u201d but added he had \u201ctaken full ownership\u201d of the situation.\nMarie van der Zyl, president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, said: \u201cAzeem Rafiq has suffered terribly at the hands of racists in cricket so he will well understand the hurt this exchange will cause to Jews who have supported him. His apology certainly seems heartfelt and we have no reason to believe he is not completely sincere.\u201d",

Farrell\u2019s absence would also deprive Jones of his influential leader as England set about atoning for their dismal 2021 Six Nations campaign in which they finished fifth. Furthermore, it would put on ice Farrell\u2019s fledgling 10-12 partnership with Marcus Smith.\nJamie George, who sustained a knee injury against the Wallabies, is also set to be out of action for up to 10 weeks and faces a battle to prove his fitness for the Scotland match. He and Farrell would hope to play some part in England\u2019s Six Nations campaign but there is the danger of history repeating itself, with a lack of game time for the Saracens contingent following their relegation for salary-cap breaches highlighted as a key reason why Jones\u2019s side underperformed in this year\u2019s tournament.\nIndeed, Jones recently said of his captain\u2019s loss of form last season: \u201cHis team was in the Championship, they had spasmodic training sessions, he didn\u2019t get high\u2011quality games.\u201d\nGeorge, meanwhile, has been in excellent form for Saracens since he was left out of Jones\u2019s training squad in September and fought back to claim the No 2 jersey in the absence of Luke Cowan-Dickie. The Exeter hooker is set to be fit for the Six Nations, however, leaving George up against it to reclaim his place.

Plus letters from David Sang, Lin Clark, Anne Cruise and Alan Doel\nMuch as I long for Zoe Williams to be right (Has the nation finally had enough of Tory scandals? 16 November), she may have underestimated the taste for a supposedly unappetising party. That is because the \u201csleaze\u201d in the headlines is not just an expression of old-fashioned greed. It shares an origin in the ideologically driven, righteous acquisitiveness that is an article of faith for the average Tory voter. It is also a tendency that has for too long been dignified by the myth of meritocracy. Together these have spawned the belief that those with their snouts in the trough have probably earned the right to do so.\nA surprisingly influential expression of this tendency spilled from an unlikely source in 1998, Labour\u2019s Peter Mandelson, who was \u201cintensely relaxed about people getting filthy rich\u201d. The fact that his caveat \u201cas long as they pay their taxes\u201d tends to be forgotten indicates how well and how far this attitude resonated with those eager to justify their own avarice. It helped create a tipping point in public attitudes to excess, fuelling the rapacious materialism that was rampant until checked, briefly, by the financial crisis of 2007-08.\nThus, while the current scandal \u201chits the nation\u2019s gag reflex\u201d, arguably this may have less to do with what we\u2019re being asked to swallow than simply the gargantuan size of the helpings. As\u00a0soon as the Tories renounce their current grotesque excesses and revert to mere overindulgence, I fear the nation will again find them\u00a0palatable. It has before.Paul McGilchristColchester, Essex\n The question is not for how many hours MPs work at outside organisations, it\u2019s who they work for (Boris Johnson plan on \u2018second jobs\u2019 would hit fewer than 10 MPs, 187 November) Here in Brighton, we have two MPs, Caroline Lucas and Lloyd Russell-Moyle, who work with organisations concerned with the environment, climate change, the arms trade, Brexit, the Middle East, electoral reform and so on. Most of this work is unpaid. They bring this experience to parliament; that\u2019s rather better for us all than the Tories\u2019 much-vaunted \u201cbusiness experience\u201d that has led us into a mire of sleaze and dodgy dealing.David SangBrighton, East Sussex\n So far, the anger against sleaze has focused on income from consultancy, lobbying and contracts given to Tory donors. But can the Guardian also publish full lists of MPs and peers whose shareholdings mean that they stand to gain wealth from decisions made by this government? For instance, it would be illuminating to see full, updated lists of parliamentarians with investments in private health, the pharmaceutical industry and any other businesses benefiting from Covid-related contracts and the government\u2019s privatisation agenda. And how about a full list of those investing in fossil fuel companies?Lin ClarkBristol\n MPs also employed elsewhere? Isn\u2019t it now time to rationalise the timing of sittings of the House? Very simply, make it a proper 9 to 5 job. Open the doors at 8am and lock them out at 6pm. This would remove access to the subsidised restaurants and bars for privileged conversations out of hours, and to journalist-free offices, where second-job activity\u00a0can go unnoticed by the public.

        "content": "Jones, who has maintained his innocence for more than two decades, was scheduled to receive a lethal injection on Thursday\nThe governor of Oklahoma, Kevin Stitt, has granted clemency to Julius Jones, a death row inmate who faced execution on Thursday afternoon.\nFollowing a recommendation from the state pardon and parole board, Stitt, a Republican, acted with just four hours to spare before the scheduled state killing.\nStitt reduced Jones\u2019s sentence for the murder in 1999 of Paul Howell, a businessman in the affluent Oklahoma City suburb of Edmond, to life in prison without the possibility of parole.\nThe parole board had recommended life with the possibility of parole.\nJones, 41, has maintained his innocence for more than two decades but had been scheduled to receive a lethal injection at the state penitentiary in McAlester.\n\u201cAfter prayerful consideration and reviewing materials presented by all sides of this case, I have determined to commute Julius Jones\u2019 sentence to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole,\u201d Stitt said in a statement.\nThe impending execution had prompted protests across Oklahoma and the US. Students at high schools across Oklahoma City walked out of classes. Prayer vigils were held at the state capitol and barricades were erected outside the governor\u2019s mansion.\nEven Baker Mayfield, quarterback for the NFL\u2019s Cleveland Browns, weighed in. The Heisman Trophy winner from the University of Oklahoma is among several high-profile athletes and entertainers who have weighed in on Jones\u2019s case.\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s pretty rough, to be honest with you,\u201d Mayfield told reporters on Wednesday, pausing and his eyes filling with tears. \u201cThat\u2019s not something that\u2019s easy to talk about. Been trying to get the facts stated and the truth to be told for a while. It\u2019s a shame that it\u2019s gotten this far, 24 hours away.\u201c\nBefore his decision, Stitt met with Jones\u2019s attorneys and Howell\u2019s family.\nJones\u2019s mother, Madeline Davis-Jones, who tried unsuccessfully to meet Stitt on Monday, spoke to about 300 people, many students from high schools, who gathered on Wednesday outside Stitt\u2019s office, chanting and singing hymns.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to go to a lynching tomorrow,\u201d Davis-Jones said. \u201cWhy would I want to see someone hang? We should be through with that. Do you want your baby, your child to be hanged?\u201d\nJones maintains he was framed by the actual killer, a high school friend and co-defendant who testified against him and was released after 15 years. State and county prosecutors said the evidence against Jones was overwhelming.\nTrial transcripts showed witnesses identified Jones as the shooter and placed him with Howell\u2019s stolen vehicle. Investigators found the murder weapon wrapped in a bandanna with Jones\u2019s DNA in an attic space above his bedroom. Jones says the weapon was placed there by the actual killer.\nThe pardon and parole board twice voted 3-1 to recommend clemency.\nPaul Howell\u2019s sister, Megan Tobey, testified she distinctly remembers seeing Jones shoot her brother in front of his two young daughters.\n\u201cHe is the same person today as he was 22 years ago. He\u2019s still getting into trouble. He\u2019s still in a gang. He\u2019s still lying. And he still feels no shame, guilt or remorse for his action,\u201d Tobey said. \u201cWe need Julius Jones to be held responsible.\u201d\nIn a separate vote on Wednesday, the board voted 3-2 to grant clemency to another death row inmate, Bigler Stouffer, citing concerns with state lethal injection protocols. Stouffer is scheduled to die on 9 December.\nJones\u2019s case was profiled in The Last Defense, a documentary produced by the actor Viola Davis for ABC in 2018. After that, Kim Kardashian West and athletes with Oklahoma ties, including Mayfield and NBA stars Russell Westbrook, Blake Griffin and Trae Young, urged Stitt to commute Jones\u2019s sentence.\nStitt appointed two of the three members who voted to recommend clemency: Adam Luck and Kelly Doyle. The third member, Larry Morris, was appointed by the court of criminal appeals.\n\u201cPersonally, I believe in death penalty cases there should be no doubts. And put simply, I have doubts about this case,\u201d Luck said on the day of Jones\u2019s clemency hearing.\nOklahoma ended a six-year moratorium on executions \u2013 brought on by concerns over its lethal injection methods \u2013 last month.

Johnson used the Windsor suite at Heathrow\u2019s Terminal 5 on 7 October, when he was en route to M\u00e1laga.\nThe Windsor suite is described by the airport as a collection of eight \u201cunique and beautifully decorated private lounges\u201d. Johnson declared its use for three people, with a total value of \u00a31,800.\nWhile Johnson was previously a vehement opponent of Heathrow\u2019s expansion to a third runway \u2013 he once pledged to stop it by lying down in front of bulldozers \u2013 he opted to travel to Kabul so as to miss a Commons vote that approved the plan in 2018, when he was foreign secretary under Theresa May.\nJohnson, after being elected for his Uxbridge and South Ruislip seat, which is close to the west London airport, told supporters: \u201cI will lie down with you in front of those bulldozers and stop the building, stop the construction of that third runway.\u201d\nDowning Street say Johnson, his wife, Carrie, and their one-year-old son, Wilfred, took a commercial flight to Spain. Once there, they stayed for free at a luxurious villa in Marbella belonging to the Goldsmith family.\nWhile the villa is rented commercially for about \u00a325,000 a week, this use of the villa was not put in the register of MPs\u2019 interests, meaning Johnson has not had to formally declare its value.\nDowning Street has confirmed the holiday was provided free of charge by the family of Zac Goldsmith, the former Conservative MP who, after he lost his seat in the 2019 election, was made a peer and an environment minister by Johnson.\nThe stay was instead listed by the prime minister in the register of ministerial interests, which is updated less regularly, and does not cite monetary values. Downing Street said this was the correct way to register the free stay, \u201cgiven the hospitality was provided by another minister\u201d.\nHowever, there is speculation that Johnson is seeking to set a precedent that costs and obligations incurred as prime minister fall under the remit of Lord Geidt, the adviser on ministerial interests, who does not have the power to unilaterally begin investigations, rather than Kathryn Stone, the independent parliamentary commissioner for standards.\nLast week, Downing Street also argued that Stone should not investigate who paid for the renovation of Johnson\u2019s official flat, as this was not connected to his role as an MP, prompting Labour to warn the PM was trying to evade proper scrutiny.\nAs a minister, Johnson\u2019s opportunity to earn extra income is severely limited. When he was a backbench MP, he was paid almost \u00a323,000 a month by the Daily Telegraph to write a column, and regularly took on speaking engagements paying tens of thousands of pounds.",

With Qatar hosting its first Formula One Grand Prix this weekend and facing new allegations of worker exploitation and abuse in its preparations for next year\u2019s football World Cup, Hamilton insisted he would hold the sport to account for the places it chooses to race.\nF1 is making its debut at the Losail circuit in Doha with the championship fight between Mercedes\u2019 Hamilton and Red Bull\u2019s Max Verstappen finely poised. However focus in Qatar once more fell on human rights issues. Workers within the state have claimed that reforms to the country\u2019s restrictive kafala labour sponsorship system have been ineffective while human rights groups continue to highlight oppressive male guardianship policies as well as discriminatory laws against women and LGBTQ+ individuals.\nHamilton has repeatedly spoken out on F1\u2019s need to address such problems in the countries it visits and did so again in Qatar.\n\u201cWe\u2019re aware there are issues in these places that we\u2019re going to,\u201d he said. \u201cBut of course [Qatar] seems to be deemed as one of the worst in this part of the world. As sports go to these places, they are duty bound to raise awareness for these issues. These places need scrutiny. Equal rights is a serious issue.\u201d\nThe Danish FA has announced its intent to criticise human rights abuses at the World Cup, seven-times world drivers\u2019 champion Hamilton believed more collective action was required.\nHe added: \u201cIf we are coming to these places, we need to be raising the profile of the situation. One person can only make a certain amount of small difference but collectively we can have a bigger impact. Do I wish that more sportsmen and women spoke out on these issues? Yes.\n\u201cIt\u2019s down to whether you decide to educate yourself and hold the sport more accountable and make sure the sport is actually doing something when they go to those places.\u201d\nVerstappen is 14 points ahead of Hamilton in the world championship but that lead was in doubt overnight because of the incident at turn four of Sunday\u2019s Brazilian GP, when the Dutchman squeezed his rival wide as the world champion attempted to overtake. Hamilton went on to win and it was adjudged a racing incident.\nHowever this week on-board footage of the incident was released and Mercedes requested the stewards review it to assess whether Verstappen was at fault. Having met representatives from both Mercedes and Red Bull and deliberated until 9pm local time in Qatar on Thursday, the FIA announced it was still considering the matter and that its decision would be published on Friday.\nShould it agree that new \u201csignificant and relevant\u201d elements have come to light it will reopen the case and if it finds Verstappen guilty of deliberately pushing Hamilton off track, it can impose a penalty. This could be a grid penalty in Sunday\u2019s race, likely to be three places, or a five-second time penalty added to his finish in Brazil. The latter would demote him to third and he would drop three points, with three races remaining going into this weekend.",

On board were 130 exhausted, nervous but extremely relieved female footballers and their families, whose dramatic journey to the UK from Afghanistan started more than four months ago, before Kabul fell to the Taliban and triggered an exodus.\nAfter months of hiding, political negotiations, frantic calls and WhatsApp messages, the help of a reality TV star \u2013 and the heroic efforts of one particular woman, Khalida Popal \u2013 the Afghan girls\u2019 youth development football team finally touched down on British soil with the promise of a new future with Leeds United.\nThe group, which includes 35 teenage players and their relatives, had been in Pakistan on temporary visas but on Thursday they were accepted into Britain after intense wrangling.\nPopal, the former captain of the national women\u2019s football team, has now played a fundamental role in at least three evacuations of female Afghan footballers. She called Thursday a \u201cday of great joy\u201d.\n\u201cAfghan female football was built on activism \u2013 to use the power of our voices and the power of our sporting platform for women\u2019s empowerment and justice beyond sport,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\u201cThis team have been through a lot and have made many sacrifices on their journey to freedom. Since August, they have been displaced from their homes and have been desperately looking forward to the freedoms and basic human rights that we often take for granted.\u201d\nThe female Afghan national team were evacuated from Kabul to Australia in August after the country fell to the Taliban, while the youth football team were granted asylum in Portugal. But the youth development team, which trains girls from underprivileged backgrounds, became stranded after attempts to evacuate them to Doha failed as they were denied access to Kabul airport amid a terror threat.\nTerrified, they went into hiding before crossing the border into Pakistan on temporary visas. Wrangling, diplomacy and advocacy followed, with a secret WhatsApp group of billionaire philanthropists, NGO workers, footballers, FIFA members, advisers and lawyers among others pinging at all hours of the night and day as they tried to pull strings and work all avenues to secure a safe place for the team.\nTheir escape from Kabul was sponsored by the ROKiT Foundation, who responded to pleas from Popal, before Leeds United\u2019s chair, Andrea Radrizzani, and the NGO Football for Peace provided support. The Guardian understands that the flight was chartered by an UK-Jewish charity, Tzedek, with some funding provided by the reality TV star Kim Kardashian.\nWhen the young women and their families set off to the UK they were overwhelmed by emotion and gratitude, said Siu-Anne Marie Gill, CEO of the ROKiT Foundation, with one saying their lives were in debt to those who had helped them. \u201cThey were overwhelmed and thrilled and excited,\u201d she said.\nAs the plane took off, Radrizzani tweeted a picture of passengers waiting to board a plane, writing: \u201cFirst chapter written today! When I received a call asking help to rescue the youth team from Afghanistan, I didn\u2019t know even from where to start. Today they flew to UK. Proud to be part of the team to make this real. Let\u2019s dream one day they will play in Leeds United FC.\u201d\nGill said that helping the young women escape, with financial backing from Jonathan Kendrick, chairman and co-founder of the ROKiT Group of companies, had consumed her entirely for 12 weeks. \u201cIt was day in day out from 2 in the morning to 10 at night,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a modern-day Schindler\u2019s List. We had to save everyone we could.\u201d\nKashif Siddiqi, a London-born footballer who played for Pakistan\u2019s international team and co-founded Football for Peace, said the last few months had been the most stressful of his life, as the NGO helped diplomatic negotiations behind the scenes.\n\u201cIt is definitely the hardest thing I\u2019ve been involved in. Trying to liaise in real time with so many governments, so many countries involved, different times zones and different personalities is difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cWe knew their lives were at stake. But I\u2019ve always said that football can save lives, and I think this is a perfect example that the power of football can really effect change.\u201d\nAs the players entered quarantine in the UK, Radrizzani said the club was ready to support the girls and their families in an \u201cinclusive and prosperous\u201d future. \u201cWe can\u2019t wait to see them playing football again,\u201d he said.",

On Thursday they dusted off the \u201cred scare\u201d playbook to portray Joe Biden\u2019s choice to run one of the agencies that oversees the banking industry as a dangerous communist.\nSaule Omarova, 55, was nominated in September to be America\u2019s next comptroller of the currency. If confirmed, she would be the first woman and person of colour in the role in its 158-year-history.\nOmarova was born in Kazakhstan when it was part of the Soviet Union and moved to the US in 1991. For John Kennedy of Louisiana, a member of the Senate banking committee, this was like a red rag to a bull.\nQuestioning whether Omarova was still a member of communist youth organisations, Kennedy said: \u201cI don\u2019t mean any disrespect: I don\u2019t know whether to call you professor or comrade.\u201d\nThe remark prompted gasps in the hearing room on Capitol Hill.\nOmarova replied, slowly and firmly: \u201cSenator, I\u2019m not a communist. I do not subscribe to that ideology. I could not choose where I was born.\n\u201cI do not remember joining any Facebook group that subscribes to that ideology. I would never knowingly join any such group. There is no record of me actually participating in any Marxist or communist discussions of any kind.\u201d\nOmarova then told how her family suffered under the communist regime.\n\u201cI grew up without knowing half of my family. My grandmother herself escaped death twice under the Stalin regime. This is what\u2019s seared in my mind. That\u2019s who I am. I remember that history. I came to this country. I\u2019m proud to be an American and this is why I\u2019m here today, Senator.\u201d\nOmarova has worked mainly as a lawyer and most recently as a law professor at Cornell University. She has testified often as an expert witness on financial regulation and even worked briefly in the administration of George W Bush.\nBut in a letter to Omarova after she was nominated, Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania requested a copy of a graduation paper she wrote about Karl Marx when she was an undergraduate at Moscow State University \u2013 \u201cin the original Russian\u201d .\nAt Thursday\u2019s hearing, Toomey noted that Omarova has written several academic papers that propose sweeping changes to the banking system.\n\u201cTaken in totality, her ideas do amount to a socialist manifesto for American financial services,\u201d he said.\nThe attacks, echoed by rightwing media, earned rebuke from the Democratic chairman of the committee, Sherrod Brown of Ohio.\nHe said: \u201cSenate Republicans have a formula. Start with a passing and inaccurate reference to her academic work, distort the substance beyond recognition, mix in words \u2013 Marx, Lenin, communism. End with insinuations about Professor Omarova loyalties to her chosen country.\n\u201cThat\u2019s how Republicans turn a qualified woman into a Marxist boogeyman \u2026 Now we know what happens when Trumpism meets McCarthyism.\u201d\nThis was a reference to the 1950s \u201cred scare\u201d, when the Republican senator Joseph McCarthy, of Wisconsin, insisted hundreds of communists had infiltrated the US government, pursuing a witch-hunt that reached into the army and Hollywood.\nOn Thursday, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts added: \u201cThis is a vicious smear campaign, coordinated by Republicans who are doing the bidding of the large banks.\n\u201cSexism, racism, pages straight out of Joe McCarthy\u2019s 1950s red scare tactics \u2026 welcome to Washington in 2021.\u201d",

        "content": "The cryptocurrency world is targeting football fans in a major way and, while it may enrich some, it comes with major risks\nDuring a recent doomscrolling Twitter session that veered between cricket\u2019s institutional racism, MPs\u2019 second jobs and people furious about Gareth Southgate\u2019s starting XI, up popped a video of Paul Pogba.\n\u201cI am happy to announce that I\u2019m partnering with a phenomenon \u2013 a project called Cryptodragons. They set the world record by selling an NFT for 35 Ethereum for primary sale in less than 10 seconds. This is huge. You see I\u2019m going to get some dragon eggs \u2013 so as you know what\u2019s gonna happen I\u2019m gonna be the father of the dragons and the next run of reservations is coming soon so keep your eyes open. Adios Dragon talking. See you guys.\u201d\nThis sounds very much like a conversation I once had with myself in a barn in Herefordshire after eating too much hash yoghurt during my only foray into illegal substances.\nWhere is Paul Pogba getting dragon eggs from? And for how long will he look after them? Is this one of those horror stories where someone buys a micro-pig and six months later they have a 200lb wessex saddleback walking around their living room?\nAs a late adopter of everything, cryptocurrency and NFTs have largely passed me by. Bitcoin is simply that poor bloke who lost \u00a3100m on a hard drive somewhere in 400 tonnes of landfill in Newport, while the excellent BBC podcast The Missing Cryptoqueen put me off cryptocurrency for life.\nSo for those who don\u2019t know \u2013 quite possibly just me \u2013 Bitcoin is one of a number of cryptocurrencies. There are apparently more than 14,000. Cryptocurrency is digital money designed to allow users to send online payments around the world without using a bank and without the oversight of any government.\nAn NFT \u2013 a non-fungible token \u2013 is a unique digital asset that represents ownership of real-world items such as art, video clips, music, etc. Most are bought with the cryptocurrency Ethereum, which is what you\u2019ll need if you want Pogba\u2019s dragon egg.\nSo you buy an NFT like you buy a piece of art \u2013 and then it\u2019s yours and no one else\u2019s. According to bitcoinist.com: \u201cNFTs are now touted as the building blocks for the metaverse.\u201d Nope, me neither.\nA company, TopGoal, has created officially licensed collections of NFTs for football fans to build \u201can entire metaverse\u201d.\nIs this just the modern-day football sticker? That obsession compelled me to steal pound coins from my parents\u2019 coats and run to the newsagents to overdose on holographic shinies from Panini 86.\nAn NFT is a sticker that no one else can have. No swapsies. No completed albums. No sending off for your last 20 stickers. You\u2019ve either got or you need.\nTopGoal has partnered with Michael Owen who \u201crecently gave his insights on the NFTs and metaverse in general\u201d. We all know Michael Owen\u2019s metaverse is that virtual helicopter tour of Dubai \u2013 watch out Sam Torrance.\nThere\u2019s going to be an auction where you can buy Owen\u2019s goal against Argentina from France 98. Also up for grabs: one of Guti\u2019s glorious assists for Real Madrid and Rivaldo\u2019s overhead kick against Valencia (take note Trevor Sinclair: you\u2019re sitting on a goldmine). Quite what you can do once you own any of these is hard to decipher. Does Owen even own his goal? What happens if I watch it after someone else has bought it? Do I have to set up a direct debit?\nPerhaps it might be wise to start small. A cautious NFT investment into a wayward Christian Benteke shot or Tanguy Ndombele turn. Or maybe it\u2019s time to go big \u2013 remortgage everything to buy both the Liverpool and Wimbledon Tony Yeboah goals. Like bricks and mortar, a Yeboah will surely never lose value.\nMeanwhile club after club are establishing links with crypto. For example, Watford\u2019s sleeve sponsor is something called Dogecoin \u2013 part of a multiyear partnership with Stake.com, a global crypto casino and sports betting platform.\nLast week Manchester City announced a deal with a company called 3Key with the aim to \u201csimplify the decentralised finance (DeFi) trading analysis user experience through the power of football to engage with our fans with a range of content and activations\u201d. So said Stephen Cieplik, the senior vice-president of Global Partnership Sales at City Football Group. But multiple efforts to find out who 3Key are have so far proved inconclusive. As Paul MacInnes wrote in the Guardian this week: \u201cAfter 48 hours, the closest anyone has come to verified information is a photo of a man with a ginger beard in a checked suit who may or may not be 3Key\u2019s \u2018chief growth strategist\u2019 Jacob Caine. City, despite requests, have not commented on the matter.\u201d\nEd Zitron \u2013 a journalist and PR expert \u2013 says in an article entitled The Nihilism and Exploitation of the NFT Industry: \u201cThe NFT industry is just another way rich people have found to enrich themselves by selling people the idea that they too could be rich if only they participated in the scheme that enriched the rich people first.\u201d He continues: \u201cNFTs [are] naturally rigged towards those who already have fame and fortune.\u201d\nThe real worry is that impressionable fans may part with money they don\u2019t have for things they don\u2019t need \u2013 and that don\u2019t appear to exist. As with all industries, there will be good and bad, and clearly some clubs have done more due diligence than others. Like gambling, some people will make a lot of money. By all means come to me in 20 years to tell me I should have sold my flat to buy Glenn Hoddle\u2019s chip against Watford.\nAnd perhaps my first mistake was having this article published at all, and not just publishing a QR code that can be read only by the highest bidder. (Credit Jonathan Liew for that idea.) A perfect square of lines and dots below which reads: \u201cWhile you\u2019re here, we have a favour to ask \u2013 you\u2019ve read 157 Guardian articles this year, why not make this your first NFT?\u201d",

Shame and forgiveness. But first there has to be shame.\nThe problem for the business model of the churches isn\u2019t freedom of belief but the dwindling of shame. Not so long ago, shame was everywhere and so were the churches. To be divorced was deeply shameful; sex outside marriage was sin and shame; a child outside marriage doomed mother and baby to a shameful existence.\nPriests threatened hell and society demanded respectability. It worked like a charm.\nFor a long time after society dumped most of the sex rules of the churches, homosexuality remained shameful. It gave them fuel in the tank. They preached hellfire for poofters and campaigned hard against decriminalisation.\nBut they couldn\u2019t hold the line. Even a million dollars given by the Sydney diocese of the Anglican church didn\u2019t persuade Australians that blokes having sex with each other was deeply, deeply, hell-heading shameful.\nWhat to do? Lobby for a law that would allow the faiths to keep on being nasty to homosexuals. You don\u2019t need protection if you\u2019re planning to be decent and kind. This is law designed to let the churches be nasty: nasty to children, to employees of the faiths and nasty in the pulpit.\nNot just nasty, but nasty without putting at risk the rivers of money that flow to church organisations from government. They want schools and hospitals and charities funded by governments where their employees can be sacked and kids expelled for being gay.\nThat\u2019s called maintaining the religious ethos of church institutions. By being nasty.\nThe Folau clause was never going to protect the free speech of teachers at church schools. If at a rally one weekend the chemistry master at St Ethelred\u2019s praised gay sex he would be for the chop. No protection whatever.\nBetween them, the faiths are the largest private employers in the country and in most states they have organised exemptions from anti-discrimination laws to maintain the religious ethos of their organisations at the expense of divorced teachers, gay students and indiscreet chemistry masters.\nA gardener in a church hospital\u2019s grounds could be sacked in most states just for being gay.\nAnd how sweet their rhetoric is as they assure us how little they use the laws they insist on having. Their forbearance, they say, is truly Christian.\nGay, divorced and adulterous teachers are rarely sacked. Gay kids aren\u2019t often told they would be more comfortable at the state school down the road. The power of the faiths is in the threat. The danger.\nVery educative, threats. They do God\u2019s work. Ask Folau.\nTruly incomprehensible to the faiths is the world turning against them on all this sex stuff. The shame is now theirs. It seems brutally unfair to the faithful. Bigotry. They blame some secular brake on their freedom to speak.\nSuch rubbish. They are as free as they ever were. But people aren\u2019t listening any more. God may not have changed His mind on all the sex stuff, but the world has. The faiths are losing their market.\nThat profitable image of shame \u2013 homosexuality \u2013 barely troubles the country now. It\u2019s not doing the business it\u2019s done for centuries. True, lots of gay kids are still killing themselves as faiths lather them with shame, but the public isn\u2019t buying the horrors any more.\nThe solution is so wonderfully secular: not prayer but legislation. The bill is complex and still secret (WTF!!) but its purpose is clear: the churches want the law to protect them from Australia. It\u2019s a bit ambitious.",

Documents leaked by a former employee turned whistleblower recently revealed the company\u2019s own internal research showed the platform negatively affected the mental health of teens, particularly regarding body image issues.\nThe investigation will cover whether the company violated consumer protection laws and put young people at risk and will be led by a coalition of attorneys general from California, Florida, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Nebraska, New Jersey, Tennessee and Vermont.\n\u201cFor too long, Meta has ignored the havoc that Instagram is wreaking on the mental health and wellbeing of our children and teens,\u201d said California\u2019s attorney general, Rob Bonta, in an emailed statement. \u201cEnough is enough.

        "content": "England\u2019s bullish head coach has dipped into his pick \u2018n\u2019 mix in a bid to handle the world champions\u2019 heavy-duty forward pack\nMuch has changed since Eddie Jones last named a team to face South Africa. Back in 2019 he was in a packed hotel ballroom in Tokyo awaiting a Rugby World Cup final that, ultimately, did not remotely pan out the way he planned. Two Covid-disrupted years on he is stuck on Zoom and admits he still awakes in the morning reflecting on the Springboks\u2019 convincing 32-12 triumph in Japan.\nWhich is perhaps why, before Saturday\u2019s Twickenham Test, Jones chose to lay down as bullish a pre-match challenge to an opposing side as he has for some time. \u201cPost the World Cup South Africa said they knew they were going to win and knew they had the wood on us,\u201d said England\u2019s head coach. \u201cThe implication is that our forward pack is weak, but our forward pack isn\u2019t weak and we\u2019ll show that on Saturday.\u201d\nThere was plenty more in similar vein, the gist being that England are no soft touch, will not be taking any backward steps and are collectively bristling at suggestions that South Africa\u2019s heavy-duty forwards were about to toss them casually on the braai. \u201cThe whole team is up for the fight,\u201d continued Jones. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a team as ready to play against South Africa.\n\u201cWe know exactly how we want to play, we know exactly where we think there is a weakness with South Africa and we\u2019ve just got to go out there and execute. And execute with a spirit of adventure, a spirit of taking the English game where it\u2019s never been before. We know this South African team is the best in the world at the moment. So there\u2019s a great opportunity for us to prove ourselves.\u201d\nJones also appears to be wary of South Africa\u2019s unhappiness following the censuring of their director of rugby, Rassie Erasmus, and the potential galvanising effect it could have on the visitors. \u201cWe know what South Africa will bring. We know the physicality, we know the Rassie story will help them. It suits them perfectly. But we\u2019re going to write our own story and we think our story might be a bit better than their story.\u201d\nBig talk before an increasingly keynote occasion that, on the face of it, could go one of two ways: a remarkable win for a transitional England side that transforms numerous reputations or a harsh lesson in why South Africa, regardless of who carries their water, remain the hardest side in the world to beat. In the absence of Owen Farrell, Jamie George, George Ford, the Vunipola brothers, Anthony Watson, Elliot Daly and others, it is also a test of Jones\u2019s selectorial touch and the true depth of England\u2019s playing reserves, both the subject of some debate at present.\nNor would many of those present on that fateful evening in Yokohama in 2019, regardless of their nationality, have accurately predicted this weekend\u2019s team sheet. Jamie Blamire and Bevan Rodd both starting in the front row, Nic Dolly on the bench, Joe Marchant on the wing \u2026 even by Jones\u2019s eclectic standards there are some unexpected lollies in this particular bag of pick \u2018n\u2019 mix.\nOf course injury and unavailability have played their part \u2013 Joe Marler would have started had he not spent the last 10 days in Covid isolation \u2013 but Blamire has played no fewer than 20 of his 23 Premiership games for Newcastle off the bench. Dolly \u2013 a special hello to him, by the way \u2013 grew up in Australia, was let go by Sale and only surfaced at Leicester this season from Coventry because they were temporarily short of hookers.\nMarchant belongs in a different category: unlucky not to have won more caps, he possesses an aerial leap to match anyone\u2019s and is clearly a horses-for-courses pick against a South Africa side who routinely hoist the ball skywards. Those among us who would have started the attack-minded Alex Dombrandt and Max Malins can only hope the game is still in the balance when they do finally get on.\nIt is a certain non-surrender mindset, though, that Jones is clearly after as he seeks to move on from his lingering World Cup disappointment. \u201cPersonally you never forget it, mate. It is with you your whole life. But then it is your ability to get past it and focus on what is important next. I\u2019ve been impressed with how our team has done that. Now I am just excited about coaching this young team and where they can go.\n\u201cThe 2019 World Cup, at the moment, is not a significant memory but that is not to say I still don\u2019t wake up in the morning and think about it. It is a scar that you have for the rest of your life.\u201d\nAnd, having passed on the sincere condolences of everyone in English rugby to the former Springbok prop Jannie Du Plessis and his family over the tragic drowning of their baby son, there was equally no disputing Jones\u2019s genuine desire to see his side earn more respect in some quarters. \u201cThey have a different team, we have a different team. We can\u2019t get the World Cup back, we don\u2019t get a gold medal back. So this game is about this South African team, who are No 1 in the world while we are No 3.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there are any secrets: you\u2019ve got to front up and you\u2019ve got to take your opportunities. They think we have a weak forward pack. We will see on Saturday.\u201d",

Once the plans are finalised, work is expected to start later this month, Poland said.\nThe minister was speaking at a press conference with his counterpart Mariusz B\u0142aszczak, who said \u201cthe support of British soldiers\u201d would help ensure that \u201cno one who tries to cross the border illegally will be able to do it\u201d.\nBelarus appeared to be trying to ease political tensions by removing its hastily constructed migrant camps at the border, although that could prompt people previously located there to disperse without shelter. Thirteen people have already died during the crisis, mostly from exposure, including a one-year-old Syrian boy whose family had made it across to Poland.\nAid agencies have criticised the UK for focusing on border security rather than providing humanitarian assistance, in an agreement that also cements ties between two countries who have been involved in their own disputes with the EU.\nPoland has also refused to accept help from Frontex, the EU\u2019s own border agency, preferring to declare a state of emergency and reach a wider military agreement aimed at better securing itself against its eastern neighbours.\nWarsaw said it was intending to buy British-made missiles and jointly develop air defence system intended to counter Russia. The deal is likely to be worth around \u00a33bn to manufacturers based in the UK, including missile maker MBDA.\nIt is the second arms deal that the UK has discussed in a week. On Tuesday it was confirmed that the UK would provide \u00a31.7bn in loans to Ukraine so Kyiv can boost its naval capability in the Black Sea by buying two minesweepers from British supplier Babcock, and jointly build a frigate and eight other missile-bearing ships.",

This is about putting families above politics,\u201d Meghan wrote of her new cause.\nMeghan\u2019s appearance on the TV show had been kept secret until Wednesday, when DeGeneres posted a trailer for the interview on Twitter.\nThe pair also discussed how Meghan and her husband, Britain\u2019s Prince Harry, had secretly visited a Halloween party in 2016, just before their relationship was made public.\nAnd Meghan revealed that Harry, whom she sometimes refers to as \u201cH\u201d, is enjoying California.\n\u201cThe lifestyle, the weather\u2019s pretty great. We\u2019re just happy,\u201d Meghan, who was born in Los Angeles, said.\nMeghan and Harry\u2019s interview with Oprah Winfrey earlier this year created headlines around the world.\nIn that interview, Meghan said she had experienced racism from a member of the royal family, and said she had experienced suicidal thoughts as a result of the environment created by the British tabloid media, and the institution of the monarchy.\nThe conversation with DeGeneres on Thursday stayed mostly light, however, with the Duchess and the chatshow host discussing their plans for the Thanksgiving celebration next week. Meghan planned to cook for the event, she said.\nThis is the final season of DeGeneres\u2019s long-running show, which was plunged into crisis last year, after allegations of behind-the-scenes sexual harassment and racist behavior on the show.\nBuzzFeed News reported that it had spoken with 36 former employees, many of whom corroborated incidents of sexual misconduct, harassment and assault. The outlet reported that allegations included sexual misconduct between executives and lower-level employees, including requests for sex.\nDeGeneres apologised and said she had \u201cnot been able to stay on top of everything and relied on others to do their jobs as they knew I\u2019d want them done\u201d.\nThe show may have appeared an odd platform for the Duchess to choose, but she, Harry and DeGeneres have been friends for some years and DeGeneres has previously defended the couple against unforgiving media scrutiny.\nMeghan and Harry broke away from the British royal family early last year and later moved to LA.\nDeGeneres has previously described them as \u201cthe cutest couple, so down to earth\u201d and said: \u201cI see them get attacked and it\u2019s not fair.\u201d\nIn the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is at 800-273-8255 and online chat is also available.

        "content": "The path to elusive league glory for the former Liverpool star starts with a fearless approach at his new club\nSteven Gerrard was asked whether he had come back to a Premier League more brutal than the one he left and his answer, offered through the faint upwards curl of a smile, betrayed old wounds. \u201cI played in a real tough league,\u201d he said. \u201cI worked extremely hard to win this competition for 17, 18 years and never managed to do it so I\u2019m fully aware of how tough it is: the individual duels, the rivalry, the teams. This league has got everything, it\u2019s got the lot.\u201d\nWinning it as a manager would, to a greater or lesser extent, scratch the itch that remained agonisingly elusive for Gerrard at Liverpool. That is not a realistic goal for Aston Villa at this point but, during his unveiling, none of the hierarchy present were of a mind either to limit or over-exaggerate expectations. The closest anyone came to setting a target was when Gerrard, reflecting on the respectable Europa League showings he oversaw at Rangers, considered the prospect of blank Thursday nights. \u201cI will miss it because I think every player, manager and fan wants to be in Europe,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the dream and the long-term goal here. We\u2019ll try and provide that as quickly as possible.\u201d\nAchieving it this season may suggest Villa have hired an alchemist, although the table remains sufficiently compact that a modest run of victories could see them rise as quickly as they plummeted during Dean Smith\u2019s latter days. In 56 minutes of conversation Gerrard said all the right things: he lavished praise on his predecessor and made bullish, if abstract, promises about culture and the brand of \u201cenergetic, exciting\u201d football he will instil, while skilfully heading off an Anfield-related bouncer or two. It was a statesmanlike bow, steely but sometimes guarded; Gerrard comes with an aura that you suspect stands him in good stead and his CEO, Christian Purslow, was keen to expound the virtues that led the former Liverpool captain to Villa Park.\nPurslow sat to Gerrard\u2019s left and, at one point, cut in to detail how he had been \u201cblown away with the level of preparation, the thoughtfulness, the clarity\u201d his new recruit had brought to a five-hour interview for the job. The joke went that, by the time Gerrard had completed his case, everyone was famished. It was clear enough that both men felt the integrity of the process, which saw a 20-man longlist whittled down to a final four, was a point worth underlining: Purslow was Liverpool\u2019s managing director from June 2009 until October 2010 and one of the temptations among those who felt Smith had been harshly dealt with was to suggest the kingmaker had taken the first opportunity to appoint an old mate.\n\u201cI think people think me and Christian are best mates and that we go to the cinema together, but I hadn\u2019t seen him for a long time,\u201d Gerrard said. \u201cI knew I would have to tick a lot of boxes, I knew it wouldn\u2019t just be given to me, I had to prove I was the number one contender for the job.\u201d\nPast acquaintances were, Purslow emphasised, purely a matter for the margins: a happy fact that cut out the awkwardness of early icebreakers but offered no leg-up. Given that judging a manager by his record in Scotland can be a precarious business it was illuminating to learn more of Villa\u2019s working: Purslow dwelled on Gerrard\u2019s year in charge of Liverpool\u2019s under-18s and under-19s, suggesting that experience will dovetail with a youth setup that has begun to generate exceptional talents such as Jacob Ramsey and Carney Chukwuemeka.\nMaintaining that production line will be a key part of Gerrard\u2019s remit. \u201cThe message to the whole academy, especially the lads that are older and on the fringes of the first team, is that we\u2019ll be watching every move they make on and off the pitch,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ball is very much in their court to go and prove they\u2019re capable of being a regular in this team.\u201d\nOn their senior colleagues\u2019 recent form, that should be an attainable goal. Ultimately, though, Gerrard will need his first-team players to perform. Smith was dismissed for not delivering \u201ccontinuous improvement\u201d, Purslow explained upon his departure; the concept arose several times on Thursday and it is not a straightforward one. If all 20 Premier League clubs had been unveiling new managers simultaneously, they would be demanding something similar: in a crowded field of similarly resourced powers for whom the perception of regression is rarely an option, Gerrard is tasked with making Villa different from, and better than, the vast majority.\n\u201cThe challenge is to find a level of consistency over a length of time where you\u2019re not yo-yoing in the league,\u201d he said. \u201cThis club will always strive to get better in every area we can. That\u2019s what you have to do in this league.\n\u201cBut you\u2019ve also got to realise it\u2019s the best league in the world, and why is it the best league in the world? It\u2019s because the best teams are in there, the best coaches. We all accept it\u2019s a tough, challenging league and we have to act on that, and that\u2019s what excites me rather than scares me.\u201d\nIf that fearlessness transmits to his dressing room, Gerrard may find the path towards completing unfinished business, whether at Villa or ultimately elsewhere, becomes considerably smoother.",

Plus, Ita Buttrose strikes back at Coalition \u2018interference\u2019\nA Nobel peace prize laureate and media mogul Rupert Murdoch might not have a lot in common, but this week Filipino journalist Maria Ressa and the News Corporation executive chairman spoke with one voice against what they both say is a threat to journalism: social media platforms.\nRessa told the Australian Strategic Policy Institute\u2019s Sydney dialogue that Facebook and Google are biased against facts and are creating \u201ca virus of lies\u201d that threatens all democracies.\nMurdoch told his shareholders at the company\u2019s annual general meeting that \u201cBig Tech\u201d needed reform because the algorithms are \u201csubjective\u201d and silence conservative voices.\nWhile Ressa is concerned about the effect on democracy, Murdoch, to be fair, is focused on the need to protect his business.\nTheir comments come in the wake of accusations by a Facebook whistleblower that the social networks are responsible for the world\u2019s increasingly polarised politics.\nRessa was awarded the Nobel prize along with the Russian journalist Dmitry Muratov for their \u201ccourageous fight for freedom of expression, a precondition for democracy and lasting peace\u201d.\nWhile Murdoch may not have powerful algorithms, he does have faithful lieutenants.\nAnd none more so than veteran business commentator Terry McCrann, who was first out of the blocks backing up the media mogul\u2019s remarks.\n\u201cSocial media like Facebook, YouTube and the rest, search engines like Google, don\u2019t need to be better regulated, they need to be destroyed,\u201d he wrote in the Australian.\nThat he rushed to print to support Murdoch comes as no surprise. Just a few weeks ago McCrann wrote a notable piece about the 25th anniversary of Fox News: Rupert Murdoch and his most amazing decade ever. Notable for its laudatory treatment of the boss, that is.\n\u201cExtraordinary and impressive as the Fox News story has been in its own right, is the even more extraordinary fact that it was the culmination of a decade of breathtaking entrepreneurial business-creating risk-taking across three continents by Murdoch.\u201d\nMurdoch does have an enemy closer to home than Facebook and Google of course, and that is the ABC, which like the digital giants is a roadblock to his total domination of the market.\nA stark demonstration of what Murdoch is up against when it comes to the ABC was a list of the top 20 Australian news sites, released this week by data analyst Similarweb and industry bible Mediaweek.\nTop Australian news sites according to @Similarweb pic.twitter.com/HrONwcZvry\nThe data, which is based on total non-unique traffic for October 2021, shows abc.net.au as the biggest Australian news publisher, with over 100m total visits for the month.\nIn second spot is Murdoch\u2019s news.com.au, the only Murdoch property not behind a paywall. The Daily Telegraph fails to make the list and the Australian is in 15th spot, not a great result for the \u201cheart of the nation\u201d. After news.com.au, News Corp websites don\u2019t come in above 14th.\nOutgoing ABC news boss Gaven Morris addressed the constant attacks on the ABC by News Corp, in an exit interview with Inside Story.\nMorris told journalist Margaret Simons he wished ABC journalists would spend less time worrying about the \u201cnoise\u201d that comes from the Australian and its News Corp stablemates and more time trying to broaden their focus to the \u201cbreadth of experience and views of the audience \u2014 working-class people, people living with a disability, people most journalists never meet\u201d. The Australian takes pot shots at the ABC on a daily basis, leading to the unfair impression that the public broadcaster is in crisis and is failing viewers.\nMorris wants the ABC\u2019s staff to ignore the criticism.\n\u201cHe worries, for example, about whether the organisation adequately reflected the views of the 30% of Australians who voted \u2018no\u2019 in the marriage equality referendum,\u201d Simons wrote.\n\u201c\u2018I\u2019m not talking about religious zealots. I\u2019m talking about genuine Australians who have a point of view that\u2019s different to the 70%. Are we at least making sure that is reflected? I don\u2019t necessarily think we struck that right.\u2019\u201d\nMorris also revealed he was not happy about the culture of leaking to the press and it stopped him being \u201cupfront and honest\u201d with staff for fear that what he said would appear in the paper.\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of the real difficult parts of the ABC culture,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve always struggled with that.\u201d\nIta Buttrose showed just how tough and fearless she is this week when accused the Morrison government of political interference.\nThe ABC chair said the government was trying to intimidate the public broadcaster after the Senate established an inquiry into the ABC\u2019s complaints handling process.\n\u201cAny incursion of this kind into the ABC\u2019s independence should be seen by Australians for what it is: an attempt to weaken the community\u2019s trust in the public broadcaster,\u201d Buttrose, a \u201ccaptain\u2019s pick\u201d by prime minister Scott Morrison, said.\nThe 79-year-old talked about her remarkable career and being the first woman to edit a major metropolitan newspaper in Australia in the 2021 Women for Media Report: \u2018Take the Next Steps\u2019.\nShe says when she left Kerry Packer\u2019s magazine empire to join Murdoch\u2019s News Ltd in 1981 she was in complete shock because there were no women in the hierarchy.\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t quite know what to make of me and clearly, editing newspapers was still \u2018a man\u2019s job\u2019,\u201d the former editor of the Australian Women\u2019s Weekly said.\nButtrose clearly has no qualms when it comes to calling out powerful men. On Sunday she accused Liberal senator Andrew Bragg of playing politics and in the report she made unflattering remarks about none other than the News Corporation executive chairman.\nAsked about working with Packer and Murdoch in the 1980s, Buttrose says: \u201cKerry was the smarter of the two\u201d.\nFor someone who has been dead for more than 40 years, Robert Menzies had a particularly active day in The Australian on Friday. \u201cMenzies \u2018aghast\u2019 at trends on campus,\u201d read the page three headline.\nNo, Ming was not back from the dead, but his spirit had been summoned for the opening of the Robert Menzies Institute at the University of Melbourne, where the federal education minister, Alan Tudge, said Australia\u2019s longest-serving PM would have been outraged by \u201cde-platforming\u201d and \u201chostility to contrary views\u201d.\nIt\u2019s a big claim given Menzies unsuccessfully tried to outlaw the Australian Communist Party and wasn\u2019t above a bit of censorship himself.\nThe press regulator has backed the Australian Financial Review\u2019s right to name \u201cBBQ man\u201d, the mystery shopper who broke Sydney\u2019s 110-day Covid-free run back in May.\nThe AFR article revealed his name, his job and his face on the front page of the paper, sparking outrage that identifying Covid-19 patients would discourage people from getting tested and cooperating with contact tracers.\n\u201cThe council considers there is a public interest in reporting on the business activities of Apollo Global Management in Australia, and notes the named person is somewhat of a public figure given his position within the organisation,\u201d the Australian Press Council said in its adjudication which cleared the Fin.\nThe statistics in the 2021 Women for Media report, by Dr Jenna Price and Dr Blair Williams, make for depressing reading. The academics took a snapshot of Australia\u2019s media landscape by analysing articles published every day of May 2021.\nMen still dominate the media industry despite the pioneering work of women like Buttrose. The gender disparity is apparent in the journalists who write the stories, the subjects of the stories and the topics of the stories.\nFor example female journalists wrote 43% of the highly visible, top billing stories, and women featured in 50% of the sample. But when men write, women feature in just 37% of the stories.\nOf the big print publications the Australian Financial Review, the Herald Sun and the Australian published many more stories by men.\nOf all the opinion pieces published across all media in May, 65% were written by men. And women\u2019s voices are still not heard as frequently in the media: only 31% of quotes are attributed to women.",

        "content": "This will be the longest partial eclipse of the 21st century, lasting three hours and 28 minutes\nAs the full moon rises on Friday night it won\u2019t be as lovely and bright as usual \u2013 but it will be fascinating. Across most of Australia the moon will be partially shrouded in Earth\u2019s shadow, so it will undergo a partial lunar eclipse as it rises.\nA lunar eclipse happens roughly every six months somewhere on Earth. For most of the year, the moon\u2019s orbit takes it above or below Earth\u2019s shadow but, during an eclipse, the full moon travels through it.\nIf the entire moon travels through the shadow, it is a total lunar eclipse. Friday\u2019s eclipse won\u2019t quite make it to totality and instead will be a very deep partial eclipse.\nThe fact that Friday\u2019s event occurs at moonrise for viewers in Australia means this will be a different experience to what is typically seen when watching a lunar eclipse.\nThe moon will be low in the sky for much of the eclipse, meaning you\u2019ll need an unobstructed view towards the east-north-eastern horizon, perhaps with the aid of an elevated viewing position. In the opposite part of the sky, the sun will be setting and Venus, Saturn and Jupiter will be visible.\nThe sun sets a few minutes after the moon rises, so for the first half hour or so the eclipsed moon, low on the horizon, will be battling the bright twilight sky.\nAs the moon climbs higher and the sky darkens we will have a lovely view of the eclipse\u2019s final phase. We can watch the moon emerge from Earth\u2019s shadow and return to its full brightness.\nAs the eclipse occurs at moonrise for viewers in Australia, your location (latitude and longitude) will determine when you will see the moon appear above the horizon. It\u2019s a little uncertain exactly how much we\u2019ll be able to make of the eclipse against the twilight sky but it\u2019ll be interesting to see what happens.\nAt the moment of maximum eclipse, 97.4% of the moon\u2019s diameter will be in shadow, while just a sliver will remain in sunlight.\nBecause it\u2019s almost a total eclipse, this will be the longest partial eclipse of the 21st century, lasting three hours and 28 minutes.\nIn Brisbane, Sydney and Canberra the moon will rise before the eclipse reaches its maximum. Brisbane will have the best view of all the capital cities, as the sky will have darkened and the moon will be fairly high by the time of maximum eclipse.\nSydney and Canberra will also see the maximum eclipse but against a twilight sky.\nFor the other Australian capitals, the maximum eclipse occurs when the moon is still below the horizon. Those places will only see the moon as it begins emerging from the shadow.\nNew Zealand is in a better position to see the eclipse. Viewers in North Island will see the entire event, while for South Island the moon rises about half an hour after the eclipse begins. The eclipse maximum will occur at 10.03pm NZDT, so it may even be possible to see a slight red tinge to the moon against the dark sky.\nPerth will miss out, as the moon will rise 10 minutes after the eclipse ends. But in northern Western Australia the moon rises roughly an hour earlier, so the final stages of the eclipse will be visible there.\nWatching a full moon rising is always special because of the optical illusion that makes the moon appear much larger when it\u2019s near the horizon.\nOf course, the moon doesn\u2019t change size at all \u2013 you can prove this by making an \u201cOK\u201d sign with your thumb and forefinger and viewing the moon through the hole, or simply by using your thumb to cover the moon. Measure the moon at the horizon and then later in the evening when it\u2019s higher and its size doesn\u2019t change.\nThis illusion is a trick our minds play on us, most likely because we instinctively think the moon is further away when it is on the horizon. When we see a bird flying, for example, it is closest to us when directly overhead, and gets further away as it flies towards the horizon.\nBut the moon is much further away than a bird, so its distance from us doesn\u2019t vary depending on its position in the sky (its distance varies slightly month to month but that\u2019s not relevant to this effect). Yet our brains treat it as though the moon\u2019s distance does change, meaning when we see the moon near the horizon we assume it\u2019s much further away, and interpret it as being much bigger.\nA simple way to explain this trick is using the Ponzo illusion, where objects at a distance appear larger, even though the two moons in the image below are actually the same size.\nHere\u2019s hoping the weather holds out this evening, so we can enjoy this rather interesting lunar eclipse.\nThis article was first published in the Conversation.

        "content": "When restrictions were lifted, experts said a surge in Covid cases was inevitable. Instead, one month on, cases continue to fall\nIn the weeks before Australia\u2019s most populous state of New South Wales emerged from a 106-day lockdown in October, a surge of Covid cases seemed certain to coincide with the easing of restrictions. Experts predicted infections would rise and hospitals braced for a spate of new admissions.\nBut instead, the opposite happened. Daily Covid cases have dropped and \u2013 more than a month after exiting lockdown \u2013 the numbers continue to fall.\nOn 11 October, thousands of Sydneysiders flocked back to newly reopened cafes, bars and gyms. A total of 446 new cases were reported across the state and 769 people were being treated for Covid in hospital.\nModelling predicted daily cases in the state of 8 million people would swell to 1,900 each day in the weeks following restrictions easing, as schools and offices reopened, with a second, larger peak around Christmas. Australia\u2019s leading medical research centre, the Burnet Institute, forecast hospitalisations would reach between 2,286 and 4,016 in Sydney by the end of September.\nInstead, new daily Covid cases in NSW fell from a peak of 1,603 on 10 September, and now hover at about 200 to 250 new cases a day. The past week saw a seven-day average of 226 new infections each day. Hospitalisations have also dropped by more than two-thirds.\nAustralia\u2019s second most populous state of Victoria has similarly seen a steady decline with new daily Covid cases dropping from a peak of 2,293 on 13 October to fewer than 1,000 over the past week.\nIt is unexpected but welcome news as other parts of the world eye their own rising Covid case numbers with trepidation, reinstate lockdowns and race to roll out booster programmes.\nFourth and fifth waves of the virus are sweeping across Europe. This month alone, Germany, Greece, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Russia and many countries in the eastern bloc have seen infection rates surge to record highs as hospitals face increasing strain.\nHealth experts say there are lessons that can be learned from the success of NSW in keeping case numbers low while reopening its economy. The combination of an impressive and rapid vaccine uptake, together with mask mandates, contact tracing and isolation requirements as well as vaccination entry permits, has largely been credited for containing the outbreak and keeping case numbers low.\nOn the first day of Sydney\u2019s lockdown, fewer than 9% of adults in NSW had received both jabs, according to government health data. By the time lockdown ended several months later, this figure had risen to 73.5%, with 90.3% of the eligible population receiving their first dose.\nDore said the turnaround in vaccine rates was \u201cin one word: phenomenal\u201d. NSW now boasts one of the highest vaccination rates in the world with 91.4% of adults double-dosed as of 18 November. The speed at which the state ramped up the rollout is counter to countries like the US and the UK, which began to stall as they approached the 50% mark.\nStill, experts believed even high levels of vaccination would not be enough to contain Covid.\n\u201cModels underestimated the impact of the vaccination on transmission, and the rate of the vaccine take-up in those first few months, particularly targeted vaccination spreading to broader geographical areas,\u201d Dore said.\nTiming was also crucial. A short interval period between Pfizer doses allowed NSW Health to vaccinate huge swaths of the population quickly and \u201coptimised the impact in preventing infection\u201d, Dore said. So when lockdowns lifted, immunity levels were high. Unlike other parts of the world, NSW maintained key public health measures even after restrictions eased.\nThe University of NSW epidemiologist Dr Abrar Chughtai said health authorities continued to mandate masks in public places while maintaining contact tracing and isolation requirements in order to curb the spread.\nThe Doherty Institute\u2019s final report, released this month, credited continuing public health measures such as testing, tracing, isolating and quarantine as \u201ccritical interventions\u201d in achieving low case numbers.\nProf Alexandra Martiniuk from the University of Sydney school of public health also cited the importance of the state government\u2019s \u201cgradual reopening\u201d, with vaccination requirements for entry in most indoor venues and social distancing measures.\nShe said NSW had also maintained \u201cexcellent\u201d testing rates, with low test positivity compared with other countries that have similar vaccination levels. About 0.3% of tests were coming back positive in NSW, while tests had continued to exceed 50,000 a day.\nMartiniuk explained the reopening of NSW was done gradually compared with countries such as England, which reopened much sooner and with more restrictions taken away all at once.\nThe public health expert acknowledged that while lockdowns can work, the \u201cnumber one\u201d avenue other countries should take in order to curb the spread was to increase vaccination rates.\n\u201cThose who were vaccinated more than six months ago should get boosters,\u201d she said, adding that although other countries vaccinated more quickly than NSW, their booster roll out had been slower.\n\u201cNSW vaccinated late but quick,\u201d she said. \u201cWe reopened in a phased approach whereas other countries reopened all at once.\u201d",

The drug, also called Evrysdi and made by Roche, is a syrup that can be taken at home and is the first non-injectable treatment for the condition.\nSMA is a progressive neuromuscular condition affecting the nerves in the spinal cord controlling movement and can cause paralysis, muscle weakness and progressive loss of mobility.\nThe NHS England chief executive, Amanda Pritchard, said: \u201cIn the last three years the NHS has revolutionised care for people with SMA, by securing access to a trio of innovative treatments \u2013 Spinraza, Zolgensma and now risdiplam \u2013 where three years ago clinicians had no effective medicines at all.\n\u201cSpinal muscular atrophy is a cruel disease and the leading genetic cause of death among babies and young children, which is why NHS England has been determined to make these treatments available to people as soon as possible to help transform the lives of patients and their families.\u201d\nRisdiplam has initially been recommended for limited use for people with certain types of SMA as part of a deal known as a managed access agreement between NHS England and Roche, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) said. Babies as young as two months old will be among the first to benefit.\nThe list price of risdiplam is \u00a37,900 per 80ml vial but a cut-price deal has been struck to make it available to the NHS.\nDr Elizabeth Wraige, a consultant paediatric neurologist at Evelina London children\u2019s hospital, part of Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 NHS foundation trust, said the development was \u201cexcellent news\u201d.\n\u201cThis will be especially important for those with SMA who cannot receive either of the two existing treatments, Spinraza and Zolgensma. These are very exciting times and I am sure this news will be welcomed by those families and individuals affected by SMA as well as by their clinicians.\u201d\nMeindert Boysen, the deputy chief executive of Nice, said the watchdog was pleased to recommend a \u201cconvenient oral treatment for people with SMA that can be administered at home\u201d.\nHe said: \u201cThis will not only be less burdensome, and therefore have a positive impact on the lives of both people with SMA and their caregivers, but it will also reduce the treatment administration requirements for the NHS.\n\u201cIn practical terms, the availability of an oral drug should lead to greater adherence to treatment, along with giving access to a treatment to those who aren\u2019t able to have other currently recommended options.\u201d\nThe mother of a nine-year-old boy from London who was the first patient from the UK to receive risdiplam through a clinical trial said the change she had seen in him was \u201cabsolutely amazing\u201d.\nMelvil Vedrenne-Cloquet, who started taking the drug when he was five, had shown \u201creally positive results\u201d and could look forward to \u201ca brighter future\u201d, his mother, Eve Chirdkiatisak, said.\nShe added: \u201cIt\u2019s fantastic for the other children and their families out there that it will now be available on the NHS, because when it comes to a diagnosis of SMA, time is of the essence.

China controls 60% of global mine production and 40% of rare earth metal reserves, raising fears of a significant threat to the supply chain for businesses.\nBut the thinktank Green Alliance said the UK could limit the threat by building up domestic recycling of valuable materials and reducing energy use.\nA rapid scaleup of the recycling of green products and their components would result in almost all critical raw material demand for electric vehicle batteries, wind turbines and solar panels being met from secondary materials by 2050, the report said.\nSusan Evans, senior policy adviser of Green Alliance, said:\n \u201cWith net zero, there\u2019s also a big opportunity for the UK to become much more resilient and self-sufficient.\n\u201cBy investing in making our homes more efficient and improving public transport, we can cut the amount of energy we need to use and, therefore, reduce our reliance on imported critical raw materials.\n\u201cThis is also about ending needless waste. It would mean keeping these valuable materials in use, creating jobs in new recycling industries, and lowering household energy bills at the same time.\u201d\nIn 2019 the country\u2019s small fleet of electric cars contained more than 1,400 tons of lithium and 800 tons of cobalt, worth \u00a326.3m and \u00a331.5m respectively. Green Alliance\u2019s analysis suggests, if recycled, that volume of lithium and cobalt would be enough to make 220,000 batteries for electric cars, or 10% of projected new sales in 2035.\nThe opportunity for using secondary materials will increase as the number of electric vehicles increases. Adopting a circular economy in the raw materials could contribute to jobs and cut dependence on China for critical raw materials.\nBy cutting energy demand and introducing measures such as insulating homes, increasing car sharing, increasing the use of public transport and walking and cycling, the UK could halve its use of some critical resources by 2030.\n\u201cBy also scaling up recovery and reprocessing, through circular economy approaches, an increasing share of remaining demand could be met with secondary materials, resulting in less environmental damage,\u201d the report said. \u201cThis would allow the UK to retain and maximise the value of critical raw materials, build more resilient supply chains and create good jobs across the country, contributing to both the levelling up and green recovery agendas.\u201d\nMining, processing and refining of the critical raw materials \u2013 such as lithium for a low carbon economy \u2013 can cause considerable environmental and social harm, run counter to goals on climate change, biodiversity and human rights, the report said.\n\u201cThe UK should adopt a strategy to ensure long-term supplies of critical raw materials that prioritises both energy demand reduction and circular economy approaches. Under this strategy, primary extraction would be the higher risk, last resort option to meet industry\u2019s requirements,\u201d the report said.\nTom Tugendhat, Conservative MP for Tonbridge and Malling, said: \u201cWe know China dominates the processing of rare earths. But, as Green Alliance point out in this important report, the UK can significantly reduce supply chain risks by creating a proper plan to recycle net zero products like solar panels and electric vehicles, as well as being smarter with our energy use.\u201d",

Hello, I\u2019m Warren Murray bringing you Friday\u2019s news in brief.\nSenior Conservative MPs, regional leaders and industry figures have accused ministers of betraying the north with a delayed and downgraded \u00a396bn rail plan. The Integrated Rail Plan sets out a scaling back of the Northern Powerhouse Rail (NPR) project and the axing of the planned east Midlands to Leeds high-speed line, with HS2 trains instead running on existing upgraded routes.\nAs recently as last month, Boris Johnson used his party conference speech to pledge that the government would build NPR, a commitment he made on becoming prime minister in 2019. However, the core route that northern leaders hoped for, a new high-speed line from Manchester to Leeds via Bradford, will not be built. Labour said the plan had \u201ccompletely sold out\u201d the north while Andrew Adonis, the former transport secretary who launched the HS2 project in 2009, said it was \u201ca betrayal of the north\u201d.\nAnti-HS2 groups, though, have welcomed the package, and environmental activists vowed to redouble protests against HS2. While people who were made to move out of HS2\u2019s path, only to be told it\u2019s not going that way now, are asking: can we have our homes back?\nModi ditches farming \u2018black laws\u2019 \u2013 Narendra Modi, the Indian PM, has announced he will repeal three contentious farm laws known as the \u201cblack laws\u201d that prompted a year of protests and unrest. After the government refused to repeal the laws last year, hundreds of thousands of farmers marched to Delhi\u2019s borders \u2013 met on the way with barricades, teargas and water cannon \u2013 and set up protest camps along highways into the capital. The farmers have remained at the Delhi borders ever since, maintaining one of the most sustained challenges to the Modi government, even through the harshness of winter, baking summer and brutal second wave of Covid-19. The protests turned violent in February when the farmers stormed into the centre of Delhi and briefly took over its historic Red Fort. Modi passed the laws in 2020 in a bid to overhaul India\u2019s archaic agriculture sector. It employs about 60% of India\u2019s workforce but is riddled with issues of poverty, debt and inefficiency.\n\u2018Terrible disaster\u2019 \u2013 Emergency crews in western Canada have continued trying to reach about 18,000 people stranded by landslides and struggling to find food after devastating flooding. Communities are braced for more torrential rain on the way. The premier of British Columbia, John Horgan, appeared to fight back tears as he spoke on Thursday: \u201cThis has been a terrible, terrible disaster but I know this: as British Columbians, as Canadians, we stick together.\u201d\nOne person is confirmed dead in a landslide and with searchers still combing through the debris the number is almost certain to rise. Residents say the disaster exposed the vulnerability of small communities to natural disasters worsened by the climate crisis \u2013 in some areas, wildfires in the summer stripped the slopes of vegetation that would have slowed the flooding waters.\nSuite getaway \u2013 It has emerged Boris Johnson declared \u00a31,800 of hospitality from Heathrow on his recent largely free holiday to southern Spain. Johnson used the private Windsor suite at Heathrow\u2019s Terminal 5 on 7 October, the latest update to the register of MPs\u2019 interests shows. In Spain, Johnson and family stayed for free at a luxurious villa in Marbella belonging to the Goldsmith family. It rents commercially for about \u00a325,000 a week. The stay was not put in the register of MPs\u2019 interests, but instead the register of ministerial interests, which does not cite monetary values. Downing Street said this was correct \u201cgiven the hospitality was provided by another minister\u201d, Zac Goldsmith. However, there is speculation that Johnson is seeking to set a precedent that costs and obligations incurred as prime minister fall under the remit of Lord Geidt, the adviser on ministerial interests, who does not have the power to unilaterally investigate, rather than Kathryn Stone, the independent parliamentary commissioner for standards.\n\u2018Reuse, recycle rare earths\u2019 \u2013 The UK must scale up recycling of materials for its low carbon industries or risk facing a critical shortage of key metals, a new report warns. Use of lithium, cobalt, silver and rare earth elements is set to soar. China controls 60% of global mine production and 40% of rare earth metal reserves, posing a supply chain risk. The thinktank Green Alliance said the UK should build up domestic recycling of such valuable materials. It says a rapid scaleup of their recycling would result in almost all critical raw material demand for electric vehicle batteries, wind turbines and solar panels being met from secondary materials by 2050.\nBreakthrough drug for youngsters \u2013 The NHS is to introduce a revolutionary new treatment to tackle the leading genetic cause of death among babies and young children. About 1,500 patients in England with certain types of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) are expected to benefit from risdiplam, after a recommendation from the health watchdog. The drug, also called Evrysdi and made by Roche, is a syrup that can be taken at home and is the first non-injectable treatment for the condition.\nAs the days get shorter and we huddle indoors, memories of 2020\u2019s catastrophic winter are close at hand. Now a new surge of coronavirus cases is spreading across Europe. But as well as notes of caution, there are good reasons to hope that the UK will avoid the lows of last year \u2013 from lower hospitalisation rates to exciting treatments on the verge of approval. How optimistic should we be \u2013 and can we still go to Christmas parties?\nSorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen $https://audio.guim.co.uk/2021/11/18-66805-TIF_COVIDCHRISTMAS.mp3\nIvan and Jason Reitman are resurrecting Ghostbusters together.

It means anyone who expresses support for Hamas, flies their flag or arranges meetings for the organisation will be in breach of the law.\nPatel hopes to push through the change in parliament next week in a move she says will help to combat antisemitism.\nShe told reporters in Washington DC: \u201cWe\u2019ve taken the view that we can no longer disaggregate the sort of military and political side.\n\u201cIt\u2019s based upon a wide range of intelligence, information and also links to terrorism. The severity of that speaks for itself.\u201d\nUntil now, the UK has banned only its military wing \u2013 the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades.\nPatel will make the announcement in a speech on security in Washington on Friday. She will say it is a vital step towards protecting the Jewish community.\n\u201cHamas is fundamentally and rabidly antisemitic,\u201d she is to say. \u201cAntisemitism is an enduring evil which I will never tolerate. Jewish people routinely feel unsafe \u2013 at school, in the streets, when they worship, in their homes, and online.\n\u201cThis step will strengthen the case against anyone who waves a Hamas flag in the United Kingdom, an act that is bound to make Jewish people feel unsafe.\u201d\nHamas has already been designated an outlawed terrorist organisation by the US, Canada and the EU, meaning that its assets can be seized and its members jailed.\nFounded in 1987, Hamas holds a majority in the parliament of the Palestinian Authority and is the largest of several Palestinian militant Islamic groups. Jeremy Corbyn, the former Labour leader, described Hamas as friends in 2009 although he later said that he regretted using the term.\nIts name is an Arabic acronym for the Islamic Resistance Movement, and it was formed after the beginning of the first Palestinian intifada, or uprising, against Israel\u2019s occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Under its charter, it is committed to the destruction of Israel.\nHamas\u2019s 1988 charter defines Palestine \u2013 including present-day Israel \u2013 as Islamic land and it rules out any permanent peace with the Jewish state. The document also repeatedly makes attacks on Jews as a people, drawing charges that the movement is antisemitic.\nIn 2017, a new policy document stopped short of recognising Israel, but formally accepted the creation of an interim Palestinian state in Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The document also said that Hamas\u2019s struggle is with \u201coccupying Zionist aggressors\u201d, not Jews.\nPatel told reporters on Thursday night that proscribing Hamas would send a \u201cvery, very strong message to any individual that thinks that it\u2019s OK to be a supporter of an organisation such as that\u201d.\nIn her speech in Washington, where she has been visiting senior members of Joe Biden\u2019s administration, Patel is expected to say: \u201cHamas has significant terrorist capability, including access to extensive and sophisticated weaponry, as well as terrorist training facilities, and it has long been involved in significant terrorist violence.\n\u201cBut the current listing of Hamas creates an artificial distinction between various parts of the organisation \u2013 it is right that the listing is updated to reflect this.\n\u201cThis is an important step, especially for the Jewish community. If we tolerate extremism, it will erode the rock of security.\u201d",

        "content": "Sandi Leroux says allegations of bullying and abuse around the Vancouver Whitecaps and Canada\u2019s youth teams were well known \u2013 and not dealt with\n\nSandi Leroux remembers the yelling the most.\nThe mother of Sydney Leroux has a story to tell about her daughter\u2019s experience climbing the ladder of Canadian soccer\u2019s elite player programs before she switched allegiance to the United States, with whom she won Olympic and Women\u2019s World Cup titles.\nLeroux says the toxic training environment in Vancouver forced her daughter to make a choice as a teenager between quitting soccer entirely or moving to the US to pursue a career in her father\u2019s country of birth.\nThe gatekeeper to success in the Canada women\u2019s program at that time was the now-infamous disgraced coach Bob Birarda, who was quietly released from his dual role as coach of the Vancouver Whitecaps and Canada Under-20 women\u2019s teams in 2008 after allegations of abuse.\nAs Sydney\u2019s prodigious talent was more widely noticed, Leroux recalls Birarda contacting her to say her teenage daughter should join training sessions with his pay-to-play private academy \u2013 a two-hour drive from their family home. Leroux said her daughter wouldn\u2019t be able to make it and explained: \u201cI am a single mom and I work full time.\u201d\n\u201c\u2018Do you know who I am?\u2019\u201d Leroux recalls Birarda shouting at her. \u201cHe started listing who he was and who he had coached. He was like \u2026 a bully. By the time we left Canada, Birarda had control of everything. He had the Whitecaps. He had the U-20s women\u2019s team. It was crazy how he took over everything.\u201d\nLeroux recalls her daughter telling her of a trip to Texas while training with the Canada Under-20 team in the 2004-05 season. Birarda was assistant coach of the Canada Under-20 team on the trip and, according to Leroux, players were called into his hotel room for one-on-one meetings.\nSays Leroux: \u201cSyd called me and said \u2018Mom, Bob makes us go in his room\u2019. By yourself. One of the players came out and said, \u2018Oh, he\u2019s gross. He told me how pretty I was\u2019. She said it was so creepy.\u201d\nLeroux said the silence around Birarda\u2019s eventual departure struck her as odd at the time. \u201cWhen things really got heated up with Bob Birarda [in 2008] we had already left Canada,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen they said they had let him go from the Whitecaps and the Under-20 team I knew immediately that he had done something. Why was this so quiet? Why is everybody being so quiet? Why is everything so hush-hush? That really bothered me.\u201d\nBirarda was allowed to coach female youth players after leaving his role with the Whitecaps and Canada in 2008, after internal investigations into his conduct. He was arrested last year in Vancouver charged with six counts of sexual exploitation, two counts of sexual assault, and one count of child luring over a 20-year period between 1988 and 2008. The charges against Birarda are understood to involve at least three former soccer players. He is currently out on bail and has yet to enter a plea.\nSydney\u2019s time with Canada\u2019s national youth teams became confusing for the player and her mother. A national team administrator told Sydney she had been cut for disciplinary reasons, while her coaches would tell her that she was still very much part of the team. Sydney\u2019s talent meant she would often play with, and against, girls several years older than her within Canada\u2019s elite youth program. This presented other problems.\n\u201cShe was getting bullied [by players] and she would come home crying every night saying, \u2018Mom if this is what it is like, I don\u2019t want to play soccer any more,\u201d recalls Leroux (similar accusations have been made by Hope Solo against the US women\u2019s team).\nSydney told her mom that if she couldn\u2019t move to the US, she would quit soccer.\n\u201cShe was getting burned out,\u201d says Leroux. \u201cShe was little. It was crazy. A couple of coaches were the biggest bullies. It was a horrible experience playing soccer here in Vancouver. It was a culture of bullying.\u201d\nCanada Soccer told the Guardian that \u201cit is not aware of any bullying allegations in relation to [Leroux\u2019s] time with the women\u2019s national team program.\u201d It added: \u201cCanada Soccer has implemented a third-party independent review of the events of 2008. This will fully review the process that was followed by Canada Soccer and the investigation that was undertaken by the ombudswoman at the time. We are limited in making further comment until this investigation has concluded.\u201d\nLater, Leroux would be coached by Hubert Busby Jr when she played for the Whitecaps in 2011. An investigation by the Guardian revealed allegations of attempted sexual coercion by Busby during his time with the team in 2010 and 2011. He has since been suspended from his job as coach of Jamaica\u2019s women\u2019s team. Busby denies the allegations.\n\u201cBusby let [Sydney] do whatever she wanted to do,\u201d Leroux says. \u201cSydney was going through a break up at the time and he let her leave and go to the States to do whatever she needed to do. I heard about what happened with him, though, and it is a shame.\u201d\nLeroux\u2019s comments come as Canada Soccer announced last week that law firm McLaren Global Sport Solutions, a Toronto sports governance consultancy, would lead an investigation into how the national governing body handled the removal of Birarda in 2008. That announcement followed Major League Soccer appointing law firm Rubin Thomlinson to investigate how Whitecaps executives had dealt with the allegations involving Birarda and Busby.\nThe complex relationship between Canada Soccer and the Whitecaps is underlined by generational ties between the head of Concacaf, Victor Montagliani \u2013 a former president of Canada Soccer who was vice-president of the organization at the time of Birarda\u2019s departure \u2013 and Bob and Dan Lenarduzzi, longtime Vancouver Whitecaps executives.\nMontagliani and the Lenarduzzis, whose fathers were friends, grew up together in East Vancouver and played on the same teams - even as adults.\nIn a 2015 interview with The Province, Bob Lenarduzzi - Whitecaps president from 2011 to 2019 - credited Montagliani with creating a player pathway from local teams to national rosters.\n\u201cWe sat down and said this is crazy, why don\u2019t we figure out who should be doing what?\u201d Bob Lenarduzzi told the Province. \u201cVictor was the one we started the dialogue with. Now there\u2019s a better working relationship between the pro clubs and the CSA.\u201d\nA Concacaf spokesperson said Montagliani had no direct oversight of the Canada national teams at the time of the alleged events involving Birarda despite being a vice-president, national teams, of Canada Soccer when they occurred. According to the spokesperson, Montagliani\u2019s role dealt with fiduciary oversight, and he was not aware of any of the bullying allegations mentioned by Sandi Leroux. Concacaf and Montagliani have said they welcome a review into the 2008 investigation of Birarda. Montagliani is also a vice-president of Fifa.\nLeroux explains that hesitancy to speak up about allegations of abuse and bullying came from what she describes as a village environment in Vancouver at the time.\n\u201cEveryone knew each other,\u201d Leroux says.\nYet as investigations begin, she now expects more players to come forward with allegations.\n\u201cIt was horrible,\u201d Leroux says. \u201cIt really was. You felt that it was the men\u2019s club. That you couldn\u2019t do anything. You couldn\u2019t speak. You couldn\u2019t complain to anybody. You would be too scared. [Many players don\u2019t speak because they] don\u2019t want to lose the chance to work for Canada Soccer in the future or lose their position on the team. Even I\u2019m still worried about saying things about Sydney. They all cover for each other.\u201d\nSydney Leroux, who currently plays for Orlando Pride in the NWSL, went on to play 77 times with the US women\u2019s national team between 2011 and 2017. She won an Olympic gold medal in 2012 and was part of the US roster that won the 2015 World Cup held in Canada.\n\u201cI kept a lot of the problems from Sydney at the time because Sydney was so young and didn\u2019t want her to have to deal with it,\u201d Leroux says. But she says her daughter was so keen to leave the environment that she had little choice but to move to the US to pursue her career.\n\u201cSydney would have quit soccer if she stayed in Canada,\u201d she says. \u201cIt bothers me today that I didn\u2019t do something at the time but I knew that if I did they would punish her. But she was already getting punished and I didn\u2019t do anything. If she had been treated good maybe she wouldn\u2019t have left. It could have been different. We probably wouldn\u2019t have looked at another option if it was good.\u201d",

        "content": "New England have faced heartbreak in the final before. But this year they could finally end up lifting MLS Cup\nThe regular season was defined by ... \nThe number of MLS big beasts who experienced a fallow year. While the Seattle Sounders stayed competitive near the top of the Western Conference, the two Los Angeles teams found themselves at different stages of a rebuild, with Toronto FC preparing for a major overhaul in the East. The Columbus Crew, the defending MLS Cup champions, failed to make the playoffs while DC United also missed out. From early on, it was clear many teams already had their sights set on 2022. GR\nNew England Revolution have been a rock of a team the entire season. Unmoved by the Colorado Rapids, the top seed in the Western Conference, the Revs dominated MLS with a 22-5-7 record. Thanks to an unflinching attacking style and Carles Gil, league leader in assists, the Revs are primed to take it all. PW\nThe dominance of the New England Revolution, who waltzed away with the Supporters\u2019 Shield after putting up a record breaking 73 points. Their trio of midfielder Carles Gil and strikers Gustavo Bou and Adam Buksa helped create the best attack in the league. It only gets trickier from here for the Revs though, as no Shield winner has won MLS Cup since Toronto FC in 2017. JF\nBest team that didn\u2019t make the playoffs \u2026\nWhile there was undoubtedly disappointment in Carson over the LA Galaxy\u2019s failure to make the playoffs, Greg Vanney has made some progress in moving the club into a new era. What\u2019s more, the Galaxy lost just one of their last seven matches of the regular season. They stand a good chance of a stronger 2022 with another year under Vanney\u2019s stewardship. GR\nLet\u2019s have a moment of silence for DC United, whose spot in the playoffs seemed safe until a combination of losses saw them plunge in the standings. The transition with new head coach Hern\u00e1n Losada was tough for the club, costing them multiple matches. The nail in the coffin was the 6-0 spanking handed to them by New York City FC on 23 October. PW\nDC United missed the playoffs by a single point despite having one of the league\u2019s leading scorers, Ola Kamara, fronting their attack. They\u2019ll rue their poor defense and an astounding difference in home form (2.00 points per game) versus their away form (0.76ppg), the widest gap in the league. JF\nYour dark horses are ... \nNot so long ago, New York Red Bulls appeared to be drifting under Gerhard Struber. However, they dragged themselves into the playoffs for the 12th consecutive year. Their defence looks much improved with Struber\u2019s high-press also more cohesive than it was during the summer. If the Red Bulls can get the better of the Philadelphia Union in their first-round match, they could be a real force. GR\nMinnesota United strategically picked up points to slide into the playoffs as the No 5 seed in the Western Conference. Their hopes ride on striker Emanuel Reynoso, who boosted the club after they started the season with four consecutive losses. PW\nThe New York Red Bulls have lost just once in their last 12 matches. After a horrible start to the season, they\u2019ve tightened up defensively, not giving up more than a single goal since their September matchup with Columbus. Rarely out of games, a couple moments of brilliance could spark a deep run. JF\nPlayer to watch ...\nAfter finishing third in the Western Conference, Sporting KC have the quality to make a deep run in the playoffs with Johnny Russell as their main man in attack. The Scot found the back of the net 12 times in his final 10 regular season games as everything he touched turned to goals. If Russell can carry that sort of form into the postseason, Sporting KC could go far. GR\nSporting Kansas City\u2019s Johnny Russell has risen to star status, particularly in a brilliant end to the regular season. Now, he prepares to face the Vancouver Whitecaps in the first-round of the playoffs. The Whitecaps have talented striker Brian White, but Russell\u2019s speed and instincts should be enough to take Kansas City to the final. PW\nCarles Gil has been electrifying for New England. After missing much of last season to injury, he returned late in 2020 to lead the Revolution to the Eastern Conference final. In 2021 the Spaniard was even better and returned to the form that made him 2019\u2019s Newcomer of the Year, bagging a league leading 18 assists. JF\nTeam at risk of going out early ... \nIf Russell doesn\u2019t find top form, Sporting KC could find themselves in trouble. Peter Vermes\u2019 side might have finished third in the West, but they lost three consecutive matches to finish the regular season and could be low on confidence heading into the playoffs. What\u2019s more, Sporting KC can be defensively vulnerable. A first-round match against the in-form Whitecaps will be a tricky test. GR\nAfter a dismal start to the season Atlanta United made a comeback with Josef Martinez leading the club during a six-game undefeated streak. But in the first-round they face New York City FC, who are coming off an unbeaten streak of their own. Atlanta failed to beat NYC FC in the regular season and the club risks falling to Valentin Castellanos, who ended the season with six goals in four games. PW\nThe Philadelphia Union have been a team on the rise for the last few years, finally making good with a regular season title during 2020\u2019s abridged season. Still, they\u2019ve never made it to the conference finals in their history. It\u2019s hard to see them progressing that far this year either. The New York defense they face in the first-round will be tough to crack. JF\nEastern Conference final \u2026\nNew England Revolution 1-1 Philadelphia Union (Union win on pens). GR\nNew England Revolution 3-2 New York City FC. PW\nNew England Revolution 3-1 Nashville SC. JF\nWestern conference final \u2026\nPortland Timbers 1-2 Seattle Sounders. GR\nColorado Rapids 1-2 Sporting Kansas City. PW\nSeattle Sounders FC 2-0 Colorado Rapids. JF\nMLS Cup final \nPhiladelphia Union have been building towards a serious playoff charge for some time. Last season saw them lift the Supporters\u2019 Shield, but suffer defeat to the New England Revolution in the first-round. Twelve months older and wiser, the Union are a well-coached and disciplined side who have lost just one of their last 11 matches. They will take some beating. GR\nNew England lost only five of their 34 matches in the regular season. The power of Gustavo Buo and skill of Carles Gil should result in the Revs clinching the title, whoever they face in the final. PW\nFrom 2002 to 2007, the Revolution made the MLS Cup final four out of six seasons, including three straight from 2005 to 2007, and lost every time in heartbreaking fashion. This year the Revolution will look to exorcise their demons. After a deep run courtesy of Carles Gil\u2019s timely return last year, look for the Revolution to continue their form and capture their first MLS Cup. JF",

In the second episode, broadcast the following week, Sanghera confronts the legacy of empire head on.\nClive is commemorated in Shrewsbury with a statue in the town centre, which during the Black Lives Matter protests of 2020 became a focal point of anger.\nFollowing a petition calling for the statue to be removed, the council voted to retain it and instead have an information panel explaining the historical context. This panel has yet to be installed more than a year after this promise was made.\nStanding beside Clive\u2019s statue, Herbert says: \u201cThere was very much a request to bring it down and there were quite strong feelings. The council resolved in the end to keep it but put a plaque on it that will tell us more. But they haven\u2019t put the plaque on. I\u2019ve often wondered if it ought to come down. It\u2019s very imperial and I\u2019ve never been very comfortable with it. I\u2019ve always wished it wasn\u2019t here, put it that way.\u201d\nWhen asked if his politics were anti-imperial, he replies \u201cYes\u201d and goes on to explain he became so when he was about 14 or 15 and was expelled from school.\nInitially surprised by his response, Sanghera says: \u201cOne of the reasons this debate has become so poisonous is because people have such an emotional connection to the history. Someone like me is a descendant of the colonised, someone like you is the descendant of the colonisers, but you\u2019re breaking that pattern.\u201d\nTo which Herbert replies: \u201cI do think it\u2019s because I am a little bit detached time-wise, I just don\u2019t like that kind of stuff.\u201d\nIn the series, Sanghera travels from Edinburgh to speak to the writer Alex Renton, who recently discovered his ancestors\u2019 involvement in West Indian slavery; and Batley and Spen on the eve of a byelection to examine the debates around multiculturalism and the culture wars.\nThe series is a deeply personal one, as Sanghera examines his own confused sense of identity, which he traces back to empire. He returns to his home town of Wolverhampton, where he visits the house where his parents lived upon arriving from India in 1967, one year before local MP Enoch Powell\u2019s infamous \u201crivers of blood\u201d speech; and goes to his former grammar school to meet a new generation of young people eager to learn the history of empire that he wishes he was taught.",

        "content": "Country goes into fourth lockdown amid soaring cases and announces jab mandate from February 2022\nAustria is to become the first European country to make vaccinations against Covid 19 mandatory, and will go into its fourth nationwide lockdown for at least 10 days from Monday, the chancellor, Alexander Schallenberg, has announced.\nThe government said it was preparing the legal groundwork for a general vaccine mandate to come into effect from 1 February, with exemptions for those unable to receive a jab on medical grounds.\nThe age from which people will be required to be vaccinated has not yet been determined, the government said.\nThose refusing to be vaccinated are likely to face administrative fines, which can be converted into a prison sentence if the fine cannot be recovered.\n\u201cFor a long time the consensus in this country was that we don\u2019t want a vaccine mandate,\u201d Schallenberg said after a meeting with the Alpine republic\u2019s heads of state. \u201cIn spite of months of persuasion, we have not managed to convince enough people to be vaccinated\u201d.\nTightening vaccine pass controls and testing requirements had started to make a difference but it \u201chasn\u2019t convinced enough\u201d, said Schallenberg, who took over as chancellor last month from his party ally Sebastian Kurz. \u201cWe don\u2019t want a fifth wave, we don\u2019t want a sixth or a seventh wave.\u201d\nAustria is weathering its most powerful wave of Covid, with authorities on Friday reporting 990 cases per 100,000 people over seven days. It recorded another 15,809 new infections on Friday.\nThe country has the lowest vaccination rate in western Europe, with 66% of its population fully vaccinated. Over the past two weeks, the conservative green coalition government has tried to prevent a collapse of the health system by making it mandatory for citizens to show proof of vaccination or recovery at restaurants and bars, and then announcing a \u201clockdown for the unvaccinated\u201d.\nThe national lockdown is expected to last until 12 December but could be reevaluated after 10 days if the Covid situation has improved. Nurseries and schools will stay open but mask-wearing is mandatory in classrooms and pupils can choose to study remotely without a note from a doctor.\nLockdown rules would end for vaccinated people from 12 December but stay in place for those who declined to take the jab.\nThose who have got their second jab will in the future only be considered fully immunised for seven rather than nine months, and can get their booster shot after four months.\n The former chancellor Kurz, who resigned amid a corruption inquiry in mid-October, had assured the public in July that \u201cfor everyone who is vaccinated, the pandemic is now over\u201d.\n\u201cNo one wants a lockdown, it is a crude instrument,\u201d said Austria\u2019s Green health minister, Wolfgang M\u00fcckstein, on Friday. \u201cBut it is the most effective instrument that we have available\u201d.\nIn particular, the planned general vaccine mandate drew heavy criticism from the opposition benches in parliament. \u201cFrom this day Austria is a dictatorship,\u201d said Herbert Kickl of the far-right Freedom party, which has advocated scientifically unproven alternative treatments against coronavirus infections, such as the anti-parasite drug ivermectin.\nWhile countries including Italy and France have made vaccination against Covid-19 mandatory for health workers, Austria will be the first country in Europe to apply such a requirement for the society at large. Outside the continent, Indonesia, Micronesia and Turkmenistan have a vaccine mandate for adults.\nUnlike other federalised countries like Germany, Austria has a centralised national database of vaccination, which the government could check against those registered as living in the country to determine who has not yet got a jab.\nMandatory vaccination is not unprecedented in Austria. In 1948 the postwar government made vaccination against smallpox compulsory by law. In 1980 the World Health Organization declared smallpox the first disease to have been defeated through vaccination.\n This article was amended on 20 November 2021. Austria is entering its fourth nationwide Covid lockdown, not its third as an earlier version said in the text and subheading.",

        "content": "Anxiety, depression and exhaustion, as well as fears of catching Covid, and the witnessing of so many deaths, are among some of the reasons, according to several studies\nMary Ann Evely already knew she wanted to be a nurse at age 15, so she started volunteering at a children\u2019s hospital in St Louis.\nFifty years later, Evely\u2019s feelings about nursing haven\u2019t changed in spite of her work during the past 20 months in a hospice unit in Naples, Florida.\nIn one instance near the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, three young men stood outside their grandfather\u2019s room, not allowed to enter because of the virus. Evely wheeled the grandfather\u2019s bed close to the window so they could at least see his face as he died.\n\u201cThat was the hardest thing for me,\u201d said Evely, crying as she recounted the story.\nWhile Evely managed to move past that sorrow, her 28-year-old daughter Veronica, an intensive care unit nurse in Nashville, Tennessee, called her a year ago, after seeing three millennials die from Covid and said, \u201cI can\u2019t do nursing anymore.\u201d\nThat sense of burnout has become more common among nurses in the US during the pandemic because of anxiety, depression and exhaustion due to the increased workload; fears of catching the virus; and the witnessing of so many deaths, among other reasons, according to several studies.\nNow healthcare organizations across the country are trying to keep a shortage of nurses from getting worse and searching for answers on how to provide relief to nurses who are ready to quit.\n\u201cEverybody has gone through some amount of stress and emotional distress with the pandemic, and nursing is no different,\u201d said Betty Jo Rocchio, chief nursing officer for Mercy, a St Louis-based Roman Catholic healthcare organization. \u201cIt seems like our nurses have had that double impact, personally and professionally, and we say it\u2019s created professional burnout, but it\u2019s kind of just life burnout.\u201d\nIn a recent survey from the American Nurses Foundation, 21% of nurses said they planned to leave their job within the next six months, and half of those who wanted to leave said it was because work was negatively affecting their health and wellbeing.\n\u201cThey have given their all for a year and a half or two years,\u201d Annette Kennedy, president of the International Council of Nurses, said at a recent press conference. \u201cThey have worked long hours. They have worked without breaks and they have been called to do a duty without protective equipment and without support.\u201d\nBefore the pandemic, Mercy had about 9,000 nurses, which was about 1,000 fewer than the health system needed, Rocchio said. That gap was further exposed as Covid patients started to fill up the hospitals\u2019 emergency rooms and intensive care units.\nDuring the pandemic, the system has lost an additional 500 nurses to burnout, retirement or better paying travel nursing positions, Rocchio said.\nThe College of Nursing at the University of Missouri\u2013St Louis (UMSL) also saw a 20% decrease in its enrollment this year, according to Roxanne Vandermause, dean of the program.\nShe doesn\u2019t know the exact reason for the decrease but speculates that it could be because people have found school to be less of a priority during the pandemic or because of how healthcare \u2013 with its masking and vaccination requirements \u2013 has become an arena for conflict.\n\u201cThere is a point where I think average citizens say, \u2018I don\u2019t want to hear about these conflicts anymore. I don\u2019t want to be part of these situations that are so completely uncontrollable,\u2019\u201d Vandermause said.\nThe UMSL enrollment is not necessarily representative of national trends. Enrollment in bachelor\u2019s nursing programs across the country increased 5.6% in 2020 from the year before, to just over 250,000 students, according to a survey from the American Association of Colleges of Nursing.\nBut whatever the reason for the UMSL decrease, Rocchio is concerned because the local nursing schools are Mercy\u2019s pipeline for staff.\nTo increase the pool of nurses, Mercy is trying to find adults already established in other careers and encourage them to become nurses by offering scholarships and flexible clinical hours for training at its hospitals, Rocchio said.\n\u201cWe are trying to position ourselves to help anybody interested in nursing school get through nursing school,\u201d she said.\nHospitals across the country have also significantly increased salaries for nurses as they compete with one another and travel nursing companies for staff. The Wall Street Journal reported that the average annual salary for nurses, not including bonus pay, increased about 4% in the first nine months of the year to $81,376.\nMercy is preparing to release an improved benefits and compensation package in order to remain competitive in the local market, though they can\u2019t compete with travel nursing companies, Rocchio said.\n\u201cWe are looking at what are the things that our workforce needs in order to remain healthy, happy and stay working at Mercy, and it\u2019s not just money but competitive childcare\u2026as well as things around retirement, wellness\u201d and flexible scheduling, Rocchio said.\nEvely, the Florida nurse, has not received a pay increase during the pandemic, but her employer did provide nurses an additional week of vacation time, she said. Still, if her husband had become sick with Covid, and Evely had to stay home from work, that would have counted against her vacation time.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think nurses take care of themselves, and of course I think they are underpaid and underappreciated \u2013 especially nowadays.\u201d But she said before Covid \u201cI felt like that too,\u201d Evely said.\nIn spite of that feeling and other heartache \u2013 she lost a 48-year-old fellow nurse to Covid \u2013 Evely remains committed to working in hospice.\n\u201cSo many people say, \u2018How do you do this?\u2019 And I don\u2019t know what the correct response is, but I always say, \u201cIt\u2019s part of life, and I am so glad that I was able to be able to help your loved one in the final journey,\u2019\u201d Evely said.\nHer daughter Veronica has also continued to work as a nurse. After the phone call, she had three days off.\nEvely encouraged her to \u201cregroup and realize you\u2019re helping people,\u201d she said. \u201cAfter that, she was fine.\u201d",

Plus, a 95-year-old message in a bottle\nGood morning.\nEmergency crews in western Canada have been trying to reach 18,000 people stranded by landslides and struggling to find food among bare grocery store shelves after devastating flooding.\nWith communities in the region braced for more torrential rain in already inundated areas next week, the premier of British Columbia province declared an emergency and gave an emotional address in a press conference on Thursday.\nAppearing to fight back tears, John Horgan said: \u201cThe positive I\u2019m going to take out of this is that it had shown British Columbians coming together supporting each other.\n\u201cThis has been a terrible, terrible disaster but I know this: as British Columbians, as Canadians, we stick together. I want to come out of this. I\u2019m going to build a stronger better province and a stronger and better country.\u201d\nHow many have died? One person is confirmed dead in a landslide that swept vehicles off a road, but with many others missing that number is almost certain to rise.\nWhat\u2019s been done to help the stranded? Troops have been deployed in British Columbia to help stranded residents, support supply chains and search areas hit by landslides and floods.\nHouse Democrats have vowed to vote Friday on an expansive domestic policy package that would overhaul large swaths of the American economy, after the Republican minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, derailed a vote planned for Thursday evening with a rambling, hours-long speech.\nAfter months of fits and starts, gridlock and intra-party warring, Democrats had been on the verge of passing the centerpiece of Joe Biden\u2019s economic vision on Thursday. But final passage of the measure was ultimately delayed by McCarthy, who used his leadership privileges to rail furiously against the legislation, the administration and the Democratic party for more than four hours.\nDemocrats eventually dispersed and Steny Hoyer, the House majority leader, announced they would return early on Friday to vote on the legislation, known as Build Back Better. If it passes the House, the measure would next go to the Senate, where additional hurdles await in the evenly divided chamber.\nHouse speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s office derided McCarthy speech as a \u201ctemper tantrum\u201d, accusing him of making \u201cunhinged claims\u201d about the bill.\nWith a paper-thin majority, Democrats can spare only a handful of defections on the package. Only one House Democrat, Jared Golden of Maine, was expected to vote against the bill.\nThe Women\u2019s Tennis Association is prepared to pull its tournaments out of China if there is not an adequate response to Peng Shuai\u2019s allegation that she was sexually assaulted by China\u2019s former vice-premier, the WTA chief executive, Steve Simon, has told US media.\nPeng, a Chinese tennis star and former doubles world No 1, has not been seen in public since she accused the former high-ranking official, Zhang Gaoli, of sexual assault in a Weibo post that was deleted half an hour later.\nConcern among the global tennis community and beyond has grown over Peng\u2019s safety and whereabouts since her allegation, with the WTA calling for an investigation and the world\u2019s top players \u2013 including Serena Williams, Naomi Osaka and Kim Clijsters \u2013 tweeting #WhereIsPengShuai.\nSimon went further yesterday, telling US media the WTA, which has 10 events scheduled in China for 2022 worth tens of millions of dollars, was willing to pull them.\nWhat did Simon say? \u201cWe\u2019re definitely willing to pull our business and deal with all the complications that come with it because this is certainly, this is bigger than the business \u2026 Women need to be respected and not censored.\u201d\nWhat have China said? There has been no official response. Neither China\u2019s government nor Zhang have responded to media queries or made any public statements.\nAnxiety, depression and exhaustion are among the reasons why nurses are quitting the profession, leaving healthcare organizations grappling with staffing shortages.\nThe sense of burnout has become more common among nurses in the US during the pandemic due to the increased workload, fears of catching the virus and the witnessing of so many deaths, among other reasons, according to several studies.\nNow healthcare organizations across the country are trying to keep a shortage of nurses from getting worse and searching for answers on how to provide relief to nurses who are ready to quit.\n\u201cEverybody has gone through some amount of stress and emotional distress with the pandemic, and nursing is no different,\u201d said Betty Jo Rocchio, the chief nursing officer for Mercy, a St Louis-based Roman Catholic healthcare organization. \u201cIt seems like our nurses have had that double impact, personally and professionally, and we say it\u2019s created professional burnout, but it\u2019s kind of just life burnout.\u201d\nMore than 20% of nurses said they planned to leave their job within the next six months, according to a recent survey from the American Nurses Foundation.\nHalf of those said it was because work was negatively affecting their health and wellbeing. \u201cI don\u2019t think nurses take care of themselves,\u201d one nurse told the Guardian.\nThe Republican congressman Paul Gosar retweeted a violent video that depicts him murdering Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez just minutes after being censured by the US House.\nNarendra Modi, the Indian prime minister, has announced he will repeal three contentious farm laws that prompted a year of protests and unrest in India, in one of the most significant concessions made by his government and a huge victory for India\u2019s farmers.\nA Republican Senator has asked Saule Omarova, nominated to be comptroller of the currency, if he should call her \u201cprofessor or comrade\u201d, thereby dusting off the \u201cred scare\u201d playbook to portray Omarova, who was born in Kazakhstan, as a dangerous communist, which was a common ploy in the 1950s.\nTiger King\u2019s Carole Baskin is refusing to speak to a detective in Florida investigating the disappearance of her second husband. The detective said the star had three times refused requests for interviews, and that the investigation was continuing.\nThey are calling it the great resignation or the big quit. A record 4.3 million workers in the US quit their jobs in August and the trend is continuing. People cite all kinds of reasons for quitting \u2013 they want a better work-life balance, they want more challenges, better conditions, more meaning. But what about those left behind? How do you stop your own career getting trampled as your colleagues race out the door? How do you manage your Fomo and quarry some advantage out of the situation?\nAfter the Cop26 conference ended in Glasgow, many activists and climate scientists felt the agreement did not go far enough and that the US government was among those who had not backed strong words with enough actual deeds. But action on a smaller level in the US \u2013 in cities and states \u2013 is gaining traction and beginning to make a significant difference. Smaller-scale initiatives to cut emissions have been the significant way that the US has made climate progress in the last few years, in the absence of stronger federal leadership.\nWant more environmental stories delivered to your inbox?

        "content": "Workers are still waiting for reforms to an industry in which 60,000 got Covid and nearly 300 died\n\nJose Tovar believes he can pinpoint the day he got Covid-19: it was 8 April 2020 and he was cutting chuck bone at a meatpacking plant in Cactus, a little town in the Texas panhandle.\nCactus might be a small place, but if you regularly eat beef in the US, at one time or another, it very likely came from the JBS meatpacking plant here, where Tovar was one of its 3,000 workers.\nThe day he caught Covid, Tovar remembers that the man working next to him on the line was visibly ill. Just two days later Tovar, an immigrant from the northern Mexican border state of Coahuila, was short of breath and had a fever.\nCompany management refused to share the health status of his co-worker, Tovar recalls, and he was told it was up to him if he tested for Covid-19. He tested positive the next day, and went into quarantine.\nAt one point in the initial weeks of the crisis, supervisors at the Cactus facility instructed workers to use hairnets, rather than masks, to cover their nose and mouth, according to Tovar. \u201cIt was absolutely ridiculous,\u201d said Tovar.\nAt the time, it didn\u2019t occur to him that he would have to fight so hard to prove that he caught Covid at work, or that in the coming weeks hundreds of his co-workers, and their families would be infected. Or that meat plant workers would be hit so hard by the pandemic that representatives would liken their experience to that of a \u201cdisposable\u201d workforce.\nThe human costs are still being fully comprehended. Last month a House subcommittee report found that workers at the leading US meatpacking plants experienced cases and deaths that were up to three times previous estimates. For Tovar and many other workers the early response by the big firms was key, and indicative of long-term, systemic concerns about safety.\nThe World Health Organization declared the coronavirus a pandemic in mid-March last year, and Texas\u2019s governor classified its spread across the state as a disaster. Yet, for nearly a month, JBS did not do enough to protect its employees at the Cactus facility, many of them low paid refugees or migrants, according to interviews with workers, union leaders and experts.\n\u201cYou just have to look at the conditions in plants to understand the way that folks were crowded without masks was an epicenter of transmission,\u201d said Melissa Perry, chair of environmental and occupational health at George Washington University. Perry was an expert for Tovar in a lawsuit he later filed for compensation benefits from the insurer after missing work for weeks due to Covid.\nWorker representatives recalled that when some people brought masks from home, human resources ordered them removed. \u201cJBS was concerned that people were going to get scared or excited [about mask use],\u201d said Celestino Rivera, the United Food and Commercial Workers union representative for the Cactus plant.\nAsked about its response to the outbreak, JBS said it \u201caggressively\u201d prioritized health and safety through a range of steps to keep the virus out of its facilities as early as February 2020. It said that to instruct workers to wear hairnets as opposed to masks would have been a violation of company policy.\nIn mid-April, the company began to install plastic dividers between workers, hand out masks and check temperatures at the entrance of the building. Employees 65 years and older were kept from the plant and anyone experiencing Covid symptoms was advised to quarantine at home.\nStill, there was immense pressure felt by employees to keep working as staffing shortages raised the specter of a temporary shutdown. The company even resorted to cash and steak incentives to keep workers on the line. By the end of the month, the Trump administration had stepped in to declare meat processing plants \u201ccritical infrastructure\u201d. \u201cWe felt there were instances where supervisors, because they were short-handed, were trying to convince individuals to continue working,\u201d Rivera said.\nState health investigators in late April were tracking at least 159 coronavirus infections tied to the Cactus plant, including one death associated with the outbreak, the Texas Tribune reported at the time.\nWhen Tovar returned to work in May, he said that in banners and other communications there was a big focus on the \u201cessential workers\u201d message. \u201cThey kept telling us we were essential so that we wouldn\u2019t complain,\u201d Tovar said. \u201cIt felt wrong.\u201d Tovar said the processor was getting by with a depleted workforce, which made the pace of production daunting. Frustrated, some of his co-workers passed around the number of Texas RioGrande Legal Aid, a non-profit organization that provides pro-bono legal services to low-income people across Texas. \u201cI wasn\u2019t looking for money, and I didn\u2019t care if [JBS] fired me,\u201d Tovar said. \u201cI wanted to fight for justice.\u201d\nThere were 914 Covid-19 cases associated with that JBS plant by the end of June 2020, Texas Health and Human Services told the Guardian in an email.\nCactus is probably best known for a Waylon Jennings song, named after the town, an immigration raid that hit the meatpacker in 2006, and a tornado that ripped through town the following year. These days, the streets of Cactus are populated by refugees and migrants. The Guardian spoke to more than 30 workers in the town; many had stories about how tough life could be working in the plant, even before the pandemic. Some described injuries, including one man who showed the Guardian his hand where one of his fingers had been amputated in an accident at the plant.\nConsidering the blood-drenched environment of a slaughterhouse it should come as little surprise that the industry relies heavily upon, and the government is complicit in providing, foreign born workers to fill jobs that most American citizens won\u2019t do. Though traumatic injuries from ultrasharp knives and bone-crushing machines are common, the gradual wear and tear of the job can also break a body. Existing protections simply do not account for the physical toll of disassembling thousands of animals into their saleable parts for a living. Ultimately it took the devastation of the Covid-19 pandemic to fully expose the vulnerability of the nation\u2019s meat processing workers.\nFrom the start of the pandemic until September nearly 60,000 slaughterhouse workers at the major firms have contracted the coronavirus, and at least 298 of them have died. An exact accounting of the virus\u2019s toll may never be known, in part, because of what has been described as weak oversight and a hands-off approach to workplace inspections that were features of the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Osha) enforcement under the Trump administration.\nOn the campaign trail, Joe Biden cast himself as a champion of the working man, calling attention to the plight of workers in the meatpacking and processing industry. As president, Biden directed Osha to issue new emergency temporary standards to protect workers from the spread of the coronavirus. He also paused a controversial Trump-era proposal that would have allowed some meat processors to increase line speeds beyond regulatory limits. Both steps were widely praised by worker advocates, among them Debbie Berkowitz, a former Osha chief of staff, now a fellow at the Kalmanovitz Initiative for Labor and the Working Poor at Georgetown University. But after several months in office, the momentum toward deeper reforms has stalled, Berkowitz said. \u201cThe meat industry has not been held accountable for their failure to adequately protect workers,\u201d Berkowitz said, \u201ca true travesty.\u201d\nIn a statement, Osha said it was committed to worker safety and added that, as Biden had ordered, it was \u201ccontinuing to review\u201d its response to Covid.\nWorker advocates and safety experts say the administration has barely scratched the surface of problems baked into the industry\u2019s DNA. \u201cThe pandemic opened a window to the working conditions inside these plants,\u201d said Celeste Monfronton, workplace safety expert, \u201cbut the attention has not really extended to the underlying causes.\u201d Large multinational companies dominate the $227bn market and before the pandemic about eight workers died annually, while coronavirus has claimed at least 30 times that number.\nIndustry critics say foreign workers are particularly susceptible to exploitation, and the US refugee resettlement system funnels refugees to slaughterhouse jobs. Nearly 40% of the US meat industry workforce is foreign born and in Texas the number is closer to 56%.\n\u201cOur government has partnered with the meat industry to bring refugees so that they have a workforce that is vulnerable and scared,\u201d Berkowitz said. \u201cAnd they get away with it because the industry is hidden from public view.\u201d Advocates say the Biden administration has shown no indication that it will take on the social conditions and policy environments that endanger the lives of workers, such as requiring that the industry engage in health and safety research.\nAttention has turned, for now, to the congressional panel investigation into how the nation\u2019s largest meatpacking companies handled the pandemic. The investigation, opened in February by the House select subcommittee on the coronavirus crisis, said not only had JBS USA, Smithfield Foods and Tyson Foods refused to take basic precautions to protect their workers, they had \u201cshown a callous disregard for workers\u2019 health\u201d. In September the committee\u2019s chair, Jim Clyburn, added Cargill and National Beef Packing Company (National Beef) to its investigation.\nWith barely 21,000 residents spread over 900 sq miles of windswept plains, the people of Moore county, where Cactus is located, have cultivated a sort of frontier mentality. Perhaps that partly explains why county officials speak so supportively about its largest employer: JBS. Tommy Brooks, the county\u2019s emergency coordinator, bristled at the suggestion the company, or county officials, should have acted sooner to protect workers. \u201cThis is a very reputable company,\u201d Brooks said. \u201c[JBS] did what they needed to do to make sure their people stayed as safe as they possibly could while still providing food to the American people.\u201d\nThe company claims to have adopted measures beyond federal guidance and industry standards, including ordering face masks in March, and requiring their use in April. Moreover, the company said workers who tested positive for Covid received up to 26 weeks of pay at the short-term disability pay rate of between 60% to 70% of their base pay. And Covid-related healthcare costs were covered in full, while the families of workers who died from the virus received compensation equal to at least one year\u2019s salary, according to JBS. \u201cWe strongly disagree with any claim that suggests we have not prioritized the safety of our workforce at all times throughout the pandemic,\u201d JBS said in a statement.\nWhen the department of state health services initially offered assistance, the company refused, and as far as Brooks and the county judge, Rowdy Rhoades, could see, there was no reason to doubt the company\u2019s decision.\nWith at least 3,476 sick and 85 dead, Rhoades acknowledged the devastation caused by the coronavirus in his county. He added that Covid restrictions that shuttered businesses was tragic in its own right. \u201cThis sounds stupid for me to say, but we\u2019re God\u2019s country,\u201d Rhoades said of how the county endured the pandemic. \u201cGod takes care of us.\u201d\nTovar missed three weeks of work with Covid and had a fight to get fully compensated from a state workers compensation insurance scheme. Since passage of the Texas Workers\u2019 Compensation Act in 1989, it has become exceedingly difficult for workers to sue over injuries or illnesses that occurred at work. Texas businesses are not required to subscribe to the workers\u2019 compensation program, but the ones that do cannot be sued for negligence. \u201cThe system is anti-worker, anti-safety and designed to benefit big business,\u201d said John Gibson, a Lubbock-based workers\u2019 compensation lawyer.\nWith few legal options, Tovar filed suit in May of 2020 against American Zurich Insurance Company, a participant in a Texas\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation insurance program, which had denied him temporary income benefits for missed work. His claim was rejected by the insurance company, so Chris Benoit, Tovar\u2019s attorney, took his case to the Texas department of insurance\u2019s division of workers\u2019 compensation.\nBenoit had to prove that Tovar contracted the virus at work, something that very few workers\u2019 compensation cases involving respiratory diseases have found. His expert witness was Melissa Perry, the epidemiologist from George Washington University. In the two weeks before his infection, Perry told the Guardian that JBS did virtually nothing to limit the spread of the virus. She based her opinion, in part, on crowded working conditions and photos that Tovar took of the plant locker room. \u201cEveryone was just huddled together with no masks,\u201d Perry said.\nBenoit argued that JBS did not socially distance its employees, or require masks at the time Tovar was exposed to the virus. The only reasonable epidemiological conclusion, she said, was that the virus was transmitted to Tovar inside the plant. \u201cWhat was also clear from her assessment is that the one thing that they had to do to lower the risk of exposure in an outbreak like this was to reduce the line speed and space out workers,\u201d Benoit said of Perry\u2019s testimony. \u201cThat\u2019s just not something they were willing to do.\u201d\nThe insurer dragged out his case for a year, but, in May, it lost, and paid Tovar that $1,300 in lost benefits, in what was seen as a \u201crare win for workers\u201d.\nCritics say the business model of meat processors is designed to sustain the health of the industry, not its employees. Injured and sick workers are looked after by a pool of company-approved doctors who, critics say, send them back to work so that production won\u2019t suffer, and the company can avoid reporting lost workdays to Osha.\nEmployers were slow to protect their workers, Tovar\u2019s expert Perry said, adding that Osha failed to enforce infection control requirements. \u201cWhat can change if there\u2019s really no data, if there\u2019s really no information, if the companies say things are fine and Osha, which may never set foot inside the plant, accepts that on face value,\u201d said Perry. For a change, union officials say the administration is listening to their concerns and seeking their input. By January this year just five meatpacking plants have been fined a total of $69,000 for Covid-19 violations.\nRather than strengthen worker protections, Texas lawmakers made it even harder to challenge negligent employers when it passed Senate Bill 6 this June. The law shields businesses from lawsuits that ostensibly acted in good faith during the pandemic. Plaintiffs must gather evidence, which in some cases, such as Covid exposure, is practically impossible, Benoit said. Despite the obstacles, Benoit believes there is still reason for hope. \u201cMr Tovar\u2019s case proves that insurance companies can be beat,\u201d Benoit said.\nTovar stayed on at the JBS plant for months, right up until he was demoted from his chuck bone duties. The change came with a pay cut, from $24 to $19 an hour. \u201cThey told me I could either take the job or quit,\u201d Tovar said. At the end of October, he quit. Within days, Tovar was working the chuck bone line at another meatpacking plant near Amarillo.\nTovar fidgeted uncomfortably on the edge of his living room couch on a late May evening. He had gone under the knife to repair a hernia only a few days prior. The injury occurred while doing the same cutting, lifting and twisting he had been doing for three decades in meatpacking houses. \u201cThe hernia tore open,\u201d he said, and the slab of beef and knife fell from his hands at the moment. \u201cThe pain was intense,\u201d he said.\nWorkers\u2019 compensation insurance covered the cost of his hernia surgery. Just two days later, he was back at work for the 6am shift.\nThe meat processing industry has been desperate for workers, still reeling from pandemic related shortages, and Trump-era limits on refugee arrivals, down from 110,000 to just 15,000. Some have been offering signing bonuses of up to $5,000. Amazon, meanwhile, has been building a warehouse in Amarillo, and many in the refugee communities hoped to land a job there, apparently unfazed by the stories of the tech giant\u2019s poor treatment of its workers.\nTovar, for his part, has been trying to find meaning in his lawsuit. \u201cI think I did the right thing,\u201d Tovar said. \u201cHopefully it helps others.\u201d\nAdditional reporting by Encarni Pindado\nThe International Women\u2019s Media Foundation contributed to this article through grants awarded to Encarni Pindado.",

        "content": "Get Off! was set up by Kiri Pritchard-McLean and Nina Gilligan in order to create safer workplaces within little-regulated industry\nAn organisation has been established to tackle sexual harassment in the UK comedy industry. Get Off! Live Comedy was launched this week with a fundraiser at London\u2019s Comedy Store featuring Sara Pascoe, Nish Kumar, Russell Howard and Sikisa Bostwick-Barnes.\nThe lack of structure and regulation within the live comedy industry, plus the fact that most of its workers are self-employed, has led to problematic power imbalances and difficulties reporting harassment. The new organisation was set up by comedians Nina Gilligan and Kiri Pritchard-McLean following a wave of revelations from the industry in 2020. \u201cWe think everyone deserves a safe, respectful workplace,\u201d said Pritchard-McLean.\nVenues and promoters can become members of Get Off!, which provides them with access to an independent HR professional as well as assistance with harassment policies and training. Individuals can also approach the organisation to report incidents. \u201cIf you\u2019ve witnessed or experienced sexual harassment you can come to us,\u201d said Gilligan. \u201cWe want victims and witnesses to feel safe enough to come forward, so that we can investigate based on evidence.\u201d\nMembers who complete training and embed a policy will earn the right to display the Get Off! kitemark, showing performers and customers that they are actively tackling the problem. \u201cWe want the general public to understand who we are, so you can consume comedy ethically,\u201d said Gilligan.\nAround 60 venues and promoters have already joined, including the Comedy Store, Glee and the Stand. \u201cI\u2019m pleasantly surprised at how enthusiastic everyone has been, from the rooms above pubs to the big chains,\u201d said Pritchard-McLean. \u201cIt shows this is a priority, they\u2019re not just paying lip service.\u201d\nJessica Toomey runs Manchester comedy club the Frog and Bucket, which is now a Get Off! member and will host a fundraiser for the organisation later this month. Toomey also sits on the Live Comedy Association board and is part of its sexual harassment taskforce. \u201cWe knew that something like this had to be set up, but we almost felt it was impossible,\u201d she said. \u201cGet Off! helps flag a venue as a safe space. If you saw a venue hadn\u2019t signed up to this, you\u2019d wonder why. If something happens in your venue, it could be quite daunting to deal with that and know you\u2019re doing it in the right way. When it\u2019s your business, you\u2019re naturally going to be protective over it, so you need someone who is not linked to comedy and can take a fair, independent view of any complaints.\u201d\nSimon Mason, production manager at the Comedy Store, added: \u201cIt\u2019s important that all comedy clubs are involved. We are the longest-standing and one of the biggest, so it seems right to lead by example. We have a lot of young comedians performing here and they have to feel safe.\u201d\nGet Off! has collaborated with the University of Sunderland to conduct a comprehensive survey on harassment in the industry. \u201cIf you have anything to do with live comedy \u2013 if you\u2019re a technician, agent, producer, whatever \u2013 please fill in the survey,\u201d said Pritchard-McLean. \u201cWe want to be industry-led.\u201d The results, said Gilligan, would help determine where to put their resources.\n\u201cOften people don\u2019t think of organisations like this until they need them,\u201d said Pascoe. \u201cIt would be great if they at least knew it was there. Anything like this requires constancy \u2013 we need to make sure this is a constant conversation.\u201d\nThe organisation will host further fundraisers in early 2022 in north-east England, Wales and Scotland. When live comedy begins to recover from the pandemic, Get Off! will ask members to contribute a percentage of ticket sales.",

        "content": "Are Electro and Sandman ghosts or from another dimension? Why is Doctor Strange acting weird? And who is the sixth member of the Sinister Six? The newly released trailer is tantalisingly full of clues \nTrying to guess the plot of a movie from the trailer is always a pointless exercise, especially given modern studios\u2019 propensity for cheating. These days, there\u2019s every chance that promo material will feature footage that doesn\u2019t end up making it into the final movie \u2026 a situation further complicated by the smoke and mirrors regularly employed by reality-bending Marvel superheroes such as Doctor Strange.\nEven so, there is so much to unpick in the new trailer for Spider-Man: No Way Home that it\u2019s worth suspending our disbelief all over again. Have the audio and video been edited to avoid giving too much away? Probably. Are there characters shown behaving in ways that will look different when given their final context? Almost certainly. Are the Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield versions of Spidey being cunningly hidden from view? It is certainly starting to look like it.\nWe do get a look at the returning villains the Lizard and Sandman, though it\u2019s not 100% clear if they are being played by the same actors as in 2012\u2019s The Amazing Spider-Man and 2007\u2019s Spider-Man 3, Rhys Ifans and Thomas Haden Church. But that\u2019s the aspect of No Way Home that is starting to come into view: Alfred Molina\u2019s Doc Oc from Spider-Man 2, Jamie Foxx\u2019s Electro from The Amazing Spider-Man 2 and Willem Dafoe\u2019s Green Goblin from the original 2002 Spider-Man film are also back \u2013 but Spider-Man\u2019s enemies may not be the ones we thought we knew.\nElectro has a different costume, Doc Oc has some strange new powers. But most importantly, there seems to be a suggestion that all these supervillains (five of them, mind, so who else will make up the infamous Sinister Six?) met their demise after a final encounter with their own universe\u2019s Spidey. Fair enough in the cases of Doc Oc, the first Green Goblin and Electro, but Curt Connors (AKA the Lizard) was imprisoned rather than killed after his brushes with Garfield\u2019s take on the wall-crawler, while Sandman was allowed to escape by the Maguire iteration. So what is going on?\nCould it be that these villains are from alternate realities that do not entirely match up with those we\u2019ve seen before? That might also explain why Doc Oc is 20 years older than in his death scene (as well as the fact that Molina, the actor, has also aged since he last pulled on the robo-tentacles).\nIf all these baddies are \u201cghosts\u201d, as Doc Oc describes them, that might explain why they are so determined to take revenge on Spider-Man, and why they appear so unbothered by the prospect of being offed all over again. It would not explain why Tom Holland\u2019s Peter Parker seems so upset by the prospect of their slipping once again off this Marvel coil, however, unless of course it is the demises of the Maguire and Garfield wall-crawlers (or perhaps the entire universes linked to them) that he\u2019s really worried about.\nWe are still in the dark about why Doctor Strange is acting so weirdly in this trailer. He doesn\u2019t seem himself at all, and it\u2019s tempting to wonder if he\u2019s really being controlled by the missing sixth member of the supervillain team. Scarlet Witch? Mephisto? A returning, or non-fake outtake on Mysterio?\nIt won\u2019t be long before we find out, as No Way Home is in cinemas from 15 December. In the meantime, good luck working out what that nebulous title is all about: is Peter going to find himself stuck for good in one of the other Spider-verses? Let\u2019s hope, for everyone\u2019s sake, it\u2019s not the tiny corner of Marvel reality that Sony retains the rights to, for he would be much missed by the MCU.",

In central and eastern Europe in particular, but also Austria, Belgium and the Netherlands, case numbers are rocketing.\nBut missing from the prime minister\u2019s remarks, and from much of the media coverage of them, was the fact that Britain\u2019s rolling seven-day average of daily new coronavirus cases is still higher than the average of the EU27, and has been since June.\nAccording to figures from OurWorldInData, the EU\u2019s average has quadrupled in recent weeks, from just over 110 daily new cases per million people on 1 October to 446 on Thursday.\nThe UK began that same period with a daily infection rate of 505 per million people, nearly five times the EU27 average. After peaking at nearly 700 in late October the rate fell to 495 on 10 November, but for the past week it has been climbing sharply again.\nThe headlines made much of Angela Merkel describing Germany\u2019s situation as \u201cdramatic\u201d, but at 536 per million, its infection rate is lower than Britain\u2019s 581 \u2013 which remains 30% higher than the average for the EU27.\nSlovakia and Slovenia are currently the EU\u2019s hardest-hit countries, with rolling seven-day average rates of 1,643 and 1,581 per million respectively.\nNot far behind are Austria \u2013 western Europe\u2019s least vaccinated country, with 64% of the total population inoculated \u2013 on 1,395, Croatia on 1,275, and Belgium, the Czech Republic and the Netherlands, all with rates of more than 1,000.\nOther EU members including Ireland, Hungary, Greece and the Baltic states also have infection rates higher than the UK\u2019s. But several \u2013 mainly those with high vaccination rates and relatively strict social distancing rules \u2013 do not.\nThey include France on 201 daily infections per million, Italy on 138 and Spain on 95, as well as Portugal, Finland and Sweden. Infection rates in Romania and Bulgaria, previously the EU\u2019s worst-affected countries, are now also much lower.\nThe WHO has said repeatedly in recent weeks that its 53-country European region is again at the centre of the pandemic, and no one knows whether those continental countries that have so far kept rates relatively low will continue to do so.\nBritain\u2019s infection rate, meanwhile, has climbed by about 15% over the past 10 days, from a base that for the past six months has been consistently higher than the European average \u2013 something the prime minister does not often mention.",

        "content": "Only a UN tribunal, sponsored by the US president, can end the culture of impunity fuelling violence and poverty in the DRC\nThe numbers are difficult to absorb. According to a new IPC report, a record 27 million Congolese \u2013 roughly a quarter of the Democratic Republic of the Congo\u2019s (DRC\u2019s) population \u2013 are facing hunger, with 860,000 children under five acutely malnourished. The DRC is home to more starving people than any other country in the world. This could have been prevented.\nWithout faith that their own president F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi will act, people are turning to the US president, hoping that lobbying using the hashtag #CongoIsStarving on Twitter will urge Joe Biden to back the creation of an international criminal tribunal for the DRC to end the impunity fuelling violence and famine risk. Shockingly, it could be that simple to bring an end to this suffering; we are asking for solidarity, not charity, to save lives and end this nightmarish crisis.\nWhen I first wrote about famine in the DRC in 2017, 7.7 million people were on the verge. Then the UN said the crisis was on the scale of Syria and Yemen. Earlier this year, the World Food Programme said 22 million Congolese were close to starvation, surpassing Yemen to become the world\u2019s biggest and fastest-deteriorating food crisis. In a little more than nine months, an additional 5 million Congolese have become food insecure.\nFor the first time, there are similar levels of hunger in towns and cities as remote rural areas, where conflict has pushed things close to breaking point; with more than 40 local and foreign militia gangs fighting for control of minerals that make mobile phones and \u201cgreen\u2019\u201d cars. The forecast remains bleak through 2022 \u2013 suggesting that the worst is yet to come.\nAnyone who has studied the DRC will know the cause of this hunger is not drought or the economy, but a calamitous culture of impunity. The problem has worsened since Tshisekedi took office in 2019 because not only has he refused to take action against the war criminals responsible for the violence and the displacement of more than 5.5 million Congolese people, which fuels the hunger, he has promoted them. How can you protect civilians from violence if the very men who caused it are in power?\nLess than a year after becoming president, Tshisekedi told France\u2019s TV5Monde: \u201cI am not here to try crimes that happened before me.\u201d\nSince then Tshisekedi has rewarded and promoted army officers under UN, US and EU sanctions for human rights violations including Gen Gabriel Amisi \u2013 who a 2012 UN report accused of running a network supplying arms to rebel groups \u2013 and Gen Muhindo Akili Mundos, under UN sanctions for his part in organising and carrying out civilian massacres. According to a 2015 UN report, not a single individual under Akili has been prosecuted for civilian deaths.\nTshisekedi has promoted other known human rights violators labelled the \u201cred generals\u201d by senior UN officials, including Fall Sikabwe Asinda, Thierry Ilunga Kibambi and Egide Ngoy. In August, Tshisekedi appointed another former rebel leader Tommy Tambwe. Less than three months later, Tambwe\u2019s militia gang M23 attacked Bukavu.\nThis culture of impunity fuels insecurity and violence, which forces people off their land, closes markets, leads to loss of jobs and income and school dropouts. Food prices spiral upwards and poverty deepens in a country where the most recent figures show 73% of the population live on less than $1.90 (\u00a31.40) a day, creating food insecurity and pushing a country already on the edge of crisis, off the cliff.\nEvery day this goes on, more and more Congolese are killed, raped, displaced and pushed into poverty. The last mortality report published by the International Rescue Committee was in 2008 and placed the death toll at more than 5.4 million, since 1998, with 45,000 dying every month due to the violence, disease and famine that follow it.\nThe UN Food and Agriculture Organization is asking for $65m (\u00a348m) to help 1.1 million of the most vulnerable Congolese who cannot survive without food assistance, including mothers who are too malnourished to breastfeed their babies.\nSo far only $4.5m (\u00a33.3m) has been raised, leaving countless men, women and children facing desperate choices: should they join one of the many militia gangs to access their land so they don\u2019t starve \u2013 compounding the violence \u2013 or become displaced, walking vast distances in search of security?\nWithout an international criminal tribunal for Congo to end this calamitous culture of impunity, the survival of millions of people is at stake. And because our president has chosen to side with killers, the little hope left now lies with Biden to sponsor a UN security council vote for a UN tribunal to act to end the suffering.",

        "content": "Springboks\u2019 ability to mix up their potent stock of forwards will give a relatively inexperienced England a severe test\nIt arrives with all the subtlety and secrecy of a great wildebeest migration. Opposing teams know it\u2019s coming, head coaches can just about set their watch by it, but that very rarely dilutes its impact. The Bomb Squad, the menacing moniker given to South Africa\u2019s replacement forwards, has become so mythologised in the psyche of Springbok supporters and players alike that it feels as if it has always been there.\nRelying on a cohesive pack of heavies that outmuscles and outlasts the opposition in a battle of attrition is not a departure for South African rugby. Stereotypes exist for a reason and the Springboks take great pride in their aggressive approach to the game. It is not always pretty, but it is effective, and brutality has a beauty of its own.\nIt was during the last World Cup in Japan that the concept of the Bomb Squad gained prominence. Rassie Erasmus may divide opinion, and his character is currently under a microscope, but there is no denying his pedigree as a master tactician. He realised the potency of his scrum and maul and devised a way to keep his set-piece motoring at full capacity throughout the 80 minutes.\n\u201cOur front-row guys did not have heavy loads,\u201d he said after the 32-12 win over England in the 2019 final. \u201cThey tended to play the same number of minutes in the tournament and that helped today.\u201d\nHe achieved this by viewing his front row as comprising two distinct units. Barring injuries or a particularly poor performance, the plan was to rotate the entire front row in as little time as possible. If he could switch it up all at once, even better.\nIn four of their past five games, South Africa\u2019s scrum has packed down with a new set of faces staring at the opposition by the 46th minute. Against Wales and Scotland, Ox Nch\u00e9, Bongi Mbonambi and Trevor Nyakane were replaced by Steven Kitshoff, Malcolm Marx and Vincent Koch before the half-time whistle. Interestingly, the starters are all close to the same height, ranging from 173cm to 178cm. Their replacements are significantly taller, between 183cm and 189cm. This forces their opposite numbers to completely change their angles of engagement.\nSome supporters in South Africa and on social media have considered this to be an indictment on the starting trio and, like it or not, the optics of three black players being replaced by three white players still touches a nerve, but the results are self-evident. In all but two of their past 23 matches since November 2018, South Africa have outscored or equalled their opponents in the second half. Marx has scored three tries from the bench, picking up where Mbonambi left off in steering a devastating maul. Maintaining that foundation throughout the contest is a major contributor to the pack\u2019s staying power.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of pride [in being part of the Bomb Squad],\u201d Kitshoff said. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the team\u2019s plan and we\u2019re willing to execute what\u2019s best for the team because the Springboks come first.\u201d\nIn the Chasing the Sun documentary, which chronicles the side\u2019s transformation into world champions, Marx confesses to having his ego bruised by the prospect of opening the match sitting down. This is why a psychological recalibration has been key to the Bomb Squad\u2019s success.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important that there\u2019s absolute transparency and clarity in terms of the plan,\u201d the forwards coach, Deon Davids, said. \u201cThe players have a big buy-in. They understand the tasks. In our training sessions, there\u2019s always good competition.\u201d\nDuring the World Cup the Springboks gambled on a 6-2 bench split, opting for an additional forward. In the series-clinching win against the Lions in the third Test, as well as their four most recent outings, the coach, Jacques Nienaber, has reverted to a 5-3 split.\nInterestingly Eddie Jones has gone 6-2 for the clash at Twickenham. Bevan Rodd and Jamie Blamire, starting at 1 and 2, have five caps between them with the uncapped Nic Dolly on the bench. All six English front-rowers have a combined 138 Tests, swelled by Joe Marler\u2019s tally of 73. By contrast Marx, Kitshoff and Koch have 133, supplementing an additional 108 from the starters.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a lot of confidence [in our front row],\u201d said England\u2019s scrum coach, Matt Proudfoot, who fulfilled the same role for South Africa in the 2019 World Cup. He also stated he had no intention of replicating the Bomb Squad with his new charges. He has already created the \u201cFight Club\u201d among his pack, declining to shed any insight as to what they get up to.\nHowever they do it, this comparatively inexperienced English unit will have to find a way of countering one of the most potent threats in world rugby. Ready or not, the Bomb Squad is coming.",

        "content": "Democrats will vote on the Build Back Better plan Friday after Kevin McCarthy furiously railed against it\nHouse Democrats have vowed to vote on Friday on an expansive domestic policy package that would overhaul large swaths of the American economy, after the Republican minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, derailed a vote planned for Thursday evening with a rambling, hours-long speech.\nAfter months of fits and starts, gridlock and intra-party warring, Democrats had been on the verge of passing the centerpiece of Joe Biden\u2019s economic vision on Thursday. But final passage of the measure was ultimately delayed by McCarthy, who used his leadership privileges to rail furiously against the legislation, the administration and the Democratic party in an overnight speech that lasted an extraordinary 8.5 hours.\nDemocrats eventually dispersed and Steny Hoyer, the House majority leader, announced they would return early on Friday to vote on the bill, known as Build Back Better. If it passes the House, the measure would next go to the Senate, where additional hurdles await in the evenly divided chamber.\nMcCarthy\u2019s protest speech enraged Democratic lawmakers who taunted and jeered, underscoring the deep animosity between the two political parties a day after the censure of Congressman Paul Gosar, a Republican from Arizona who shared a video depicting himself killing congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and threatening Biden.\nAt one point during his discursive and angry monologue, McCarthy quoted the Democratic congresswoman Abigail Spanberger: \u201cNobody elected Joe Biden to be FDR.\u201d\n\u201cI did,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez shouted.\n.@AOC just went \u201clive from the cloakroom\u201d on Instagram to trash @GOPLeader\u2019s speech as \u201cone of the worst, lowest quality speeches\u201d pic.twitter.com/0jypYNSlmk\nHouse speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s office derided McCarthy\u2019s speech as a \u201ctemper tantrum\u201d, accusing him of making \u201cunhinged claims\u201d about the bill.\nShortly after midnight, Democrats began to file out of the chamber. \u201cI\u2019m not going to stop,\u201d McCarthy said as they left. \u201cI\u2019m really not talking to them. I\u2019m talking to the American people.\u201d\nThe planned vote follows the release of a cost estimate from the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, as requested by a band of centrist Democrats with concerns about the legislation\u2019s impact on the federal deficit.\nGoodnight everyone, except the rambling fool on the house floor who hasn\u2019t realized we all went home and the American people are asleep. https://t.co/nVck9v9EhP\nThe analysis found that the bill would spend $1.7tn over 10 years, increasing the deficit by $367bn over the same span of time. The score did not include estimates of Democrats\u2019 plans to raise revenue by increasing enforcement of federal tax laws.\nThe budget office separately predicted that boosting funding for the Internal Revenue Service by $80bn would raise $207bn in revenue, shrinking the deficit to $160bn over 10 years. The estimate was far less than the $400bn the White House said would be raised by tougher IRS enforcement.\nWith the analysis complete, the treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, said in a statement that \u201cBuild Back Better is fully paid for\u201d and would ultimately reduce the country\u2019s debt by enacting \u201creforms that ask the wealthiest Americans and large corporations to pay their fair share\u201d.\nThe budget score appeared to be enough to placate worried centrists, at least for now. Congresswoman Stephanie Murphy, co-chair of the centrist Blue Dog coalition, said she would vote for the bill, despite \u201creservations about the overall size of the legislation\u201d.\n\u201cI will work with my Senate colleagues to improve this bill, and I hope to vote on \u2013 and enact \u2013 a more streamlined version of the bill once it returns from the Senate,\u201d she said in a statement.\nThe package is ambitious: it aims to dramatically reduce childcare costs, provide universal pre-kindergarten for children, lower the cost of prescription drugs for seniors, expand Medicare to cover hearing aids, extend work permits to millions of undocumented immigrants and provide the largest-ever investment in efforts to combat the climate crisis. The House version of the legislation also includes four weeks of paid family and medical leave, though the provision faces opposition from Senator Joe Manchin, a Democrat of West Virginia.\nWith a paper-thin majority, Democrats can spare only a handful of defections on the package. Only one House Democrat, Jared Golden of Maine, was expected to vote against the bill.\nPelosi had twice attempted to bring the spending bill to the floor for a vote, only to see those plans unravel amid a standoff between progressives and moderates over Biden\u2019s double-barreled legislative agenda. A truce brokered by the president and the Congressional Black Caucus helped secure the passage of a sprawling public works bill earlier this month and paved the way for Friday\u2019s vote.\nTwo of the Senate\u2019s 50 Democrats, Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, have not yet committed to supporting the package, even as negotiators reshaped the climate and tax portions of the package to meet their demands.\n\u201cThis was like a Rubik\u2019s cube, trying to get all the different provisions together,\u201d Congressman Joaquin Castro of Texas said at a press conference highlighting the immigration reforms contained in the bill. \u201cYou move one piece and there\u2019s a constituency or a caucus in the House or Senate that is unhappy.\u201d\nOpening the House floor debate on Thursday, Democrats touted the historic nature of the legislation. Congressman John Yarmuth of Kentucky, the chair of the House budget panel, which played a critical role in shaping the package, said any single element of the bill by itself would be significant, but together they represented the \u201cmost consequential legislation for American families since the New Deal\u201d.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a hell of a bill,\u201d he said.\nDemocrats and Republicans sparred on the House floor over the economics of the plan. Republicans assailed it as reckless spending that would exacerbate the trend of rising inflation and slow economic growth. Democrats argued the opposite, that the bill would actually combat inflation while relieving many of the financial stressors Americans face, such as the cost of childcare and prescription drugs.\nThough many of the bill\u2019s initiatives remain broadly popular among voters, including among Republicans, boiling economic discontent have sent Biden\u2019s approval ratings tumbling.\nFacing daunting challenges in next year\u2019s midterm elections, Democrats are hopeful that enacting Biden\u2019s agenda in full will bring something of a reversal of fortunes for the party. But McCarthy, who hopes to be speaker if Republicans take back control of the House next year, predicted otherwise.\n\u201cCould she be the speaker in modern history, one of the few to lose the House twice and lose the most seats?\u201d he said, breaking her record for the longest House floor speech in history. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d",

        "content": "New York is giving kids $100 to get jabbed, and there\u2019s exceedingly good news on the confectionery front\nWith a capitalist zeal I admire, New York is bribing young kids to get vaccinated, as it bribed their older siblings and parents before them. Not for these under-12s the lame promise of protecting grandma at Thanksgiving next week. Instead, a more reliable incentive: cold, hard cash. For every child who gets a Covid shot at a state school or city-run site, a guaranteed $100 payment. If you catch Covid and wind up on a ventilator, the American healthcare system will come for your house. But at prevention stage it\u2019s all high-fives and free money. By American standards it\u2019s thrilling.\nTwo weeks after my six-year-olds receive their first vaccine, we head to Times Square to collect our bribe. The city is up to something with its choice of venues. There are 3 million under-18s eligible for the vaccine in New York, and if every one of them claims the cash it will murder the city\u2019s finances. So it is that in each of the five boroughs there is a single, discouraging location from which to collect the pre-loaded debit cards. In Brooklyn it\u2019s an obscure YMCA halfway to Coney Island. In Queens \u2013 a huge borough \u2013 it\u2019s a single vaccination site in East Flushing. The Manhattan pickup site occupies the most revolting corner of revolting Times Square, a hard-to-spot building where the foot traffic outside looks like a Covid party.\nWe will not be deterred. We take the bus to 57th street and walk 10 blocks, past the Platinum Dolls pole-dancing club, past the huge advertising hoarding decrying antisemitism, past the baffling line of people waiting to gain entrance to the M&M store. Inside the test site we present ourselves to the vaccine incentive pickup table, show our vaccine cards and collect our winnings.\nOne hundred dollars is a lot of money for a six-year-old, and in the run-up to collection I have been torn between using it to teach my kids financial literacy and downplaying it to preserve their innocence. As it turns out, I needn\u2019t have fretted. Ten minutes after pickup they\u2019ve both forgotten the whole thing, the excitement having apparently been entirely found in the journey. I activate the cards and start spending the money.\nFor the last 18 months, Ghislaine Maxwell has been a guest of the Metropolitan Detention Centre in Brooklyn, a facility, her lawyer Bobbi C Sternheim complained, that is \u201cpermeated with mould and vermin\u201d, resulting in her client \u201csustaining hair loss\u201d and other physical impairments. On Tuesday Maxwell appeared in a court in lower Manhattan while prospective jurors were selected for her sex trafficking trial. She had travelled in from Brooklyn in shackles, but appeared before the court unencumbered and in civilian clothing. According to the report in the Guardian, she was \u201crelaxed\u201d and \u201claughing\u201d with her attorneys. No photos were permitted, but in a drawing by the court artist Maxwell looked like the heroine of a pulp fiction novel, peering slyly over the top of her mask. Her hair looked fulsome.\nIt was a far cry from the parties of the early 2000s, or those months in 2019 between Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s arrest and her own, which \u2013 after a ruling from the judge \u2013 the prosecution won\u2019t be permitted to characterise as Maxwell being on the lam. (She wasn\u2019t hiding, her lawyers insist; she was unaware she was being looked for, and it was mere coincidence that during that time she changed phones, email addresses, and ordered packages for delivery using a different person\u2019s name.)\nMaxwell\u2019s lawyers also asked the judge to prevent the prosecution from referring to her accusers as \u201cvictims\u201d, a request he denied. Since Maxwell is, it\u2019s assumed, intending to fight her case partly on the basis that she herself was exploited by Epstein \u2013 \u201clike many people who achieve great power and wealth, Jeffrey Epstein exploited the \u2018halo effect\u2019 to surround himself with people who would serve his needs\u201d, her lawyers said in an earlier court filing \u2013 Maxwell\u2019s victimisation is surely dependent for its credibility on the wider victimhood of others. Her point, I suppose, is that she wasn\u2019t the one doing the victimising. Like her erstwhile pal Prince Andrew, she may choose to use the defence that when it came to abandoning her friend the financier and sex offender, she was simply too honourable to walk away.\nRipple effects were felt midweek from the latest addition to a small but enjoyable sub-genre of New York stories, the blockbuster divorce. At Sotheby\u2019s an auction triggered by the dissolution of Harry and Linda Macklowe\u2019s marriage resulted in $650m worth of art sales, driven by works by Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko, Cy Twombly and Andy Warhol. The pair separated in 2018, whereupon a judge ordered their $2bn fortune be divided and the famous Macklowe collection sold off.\nOne piece of pop art missing from the auction was the 42ft billboard that Harry Macklowe, who made his fortune in real estate, affixed to the side of a building he owned at 432 Park Avenue a year after his divorce. It featured a photo of him and one of Patricia Landeau, the woman he married in 2019. The purpose of the billboard, he said, was to celebrate his new bride, although it wasn\u2019t lost on observers that his ex-wife had been going to move into 432 Park. Who knows what revenge art this spectacular might have fetched.\nThursday\nMost British confectionary imported to the US ends up in the niche British section of the supermarket, but I have high hopes that with Mr Kipling we may finally break through. The manufacturer, Premier Foods, which owns Bisto and Angel Delight, is pushing expansion into the US market after the success of its cake slice rollout in Canada. Unlike Colonel Sanders or Ronald McDonald, Mr Kipling doesn\u2019t even have an avatar, and yet the company\u2019s 80s marketing campaigns must have been very shrewd. Mere mention of the brand and, along with the indelible image of the battenberg squares, the phrase \u201cexceedingly good cakes\u201d wafts up from the past, accompanied by the vague smell of almonds.\nMy children have grabbed hold of the term \u201cparty bus\u201d and every bus, coach and minivan we pass triggers the question: \u201cIs that a party bus?\u201d Times Square was very busy for this line of inquiry, but it doesn\u2019t let up all week, culminating in the spotting of several party buses at 8am on the school run.\n\u201cWhat do you think is inside a party bus?\u201d I ask, finally.

Nearly all the biggest faiths in the UK have offered online services and prayer sessions since March 2020 when places of worship were closed.\nThe enthusiasm for virtual worship surprised many faith leaders. Since restrictions on in-person worship were eased and eventually lifted, a significant proportion of congregations have opted to continue practising their faith online.\nFor some, continued anxieties about Covid transmission have been a key factor in staying away from places of worship. Others who are at home because of illness, disability or caring responsibilities have found a way of sharing in collective worship previously denied to them.\nBut some have simply found online worship more convenient, and the bishops\u2019 statement suggests concern that a number of Catholics may have discovered alternative ways of spending Sundays.\nA key part of Roman Catholic teaching is that the faithful must physically receive the sacraments from a priest. But during the Covid crisis, Pope Francis has urged people to celebrate a \u201cspiritual communion\u201d.\nThe bishops\u2019 statement, issued at the end of a meeting in Leeds, said Sunday mass was \u201cthe very heartbeat of the church and of our personal life of faith\u201d and attending mass was \u201ca personal response to the selfless offering of Christ\u2019s love\u201d.\nIt added: \u201cWe recognise that for some people there may be certain factors that hinder attendance at Sunday mass. The pandemic is clearly not over. The risk of infection is still present. For some, there is legitimate fear in gathering together.\n\u201cAs your bishops, we recognise that these prevailing circumstances suggest that not everyone is yet in the position to fulfil the absolute duty to attend freely Sunday mass.\u201d\nHowever, it added: \u201cWe now encourage all Catholics to look again at the patterns they have formed in recent months with regard to going to mass on Sundays. This would include consideration and reflection about what we might do on Sundays, such as sports or shopping, or other leisure and social activities.\n\u201cThis review, and the decisions which arise from it, fall to every Catholic and we trust this will be done with honesty, motivated by a real love for the Lord whom we encounter in the mass.\u201d\nAn international study of the effect of the pandemic on the faith of young people and families published this month found widespread disengagement and disconnection, and that many failed to return to church after lockdowns eased, the Church Times reported.",

This week the Guardian revealed how two scientists had refused to allow their work to be featured by the museum.\nJess Worth of the campaign group Culture Unstained, which campaigns to stop fossil fuel sponsorship of the arts, said: \u201cThe Science Museum continues to dismiss all critics of its fossil fuel partnerships as wilfully misinformed activists, but in reality it is facing a profound crisis in confidence from the scientific community and losing the public\u2019s trust.\u201d\nLast month the climate scientist Prof Chris Rapley, a former director of the Science Museum, resigned from its advisory board, saying he disagreed with its \u201congoing willingness to accept oil and gas company sponsorship\u201d.\nA few weeks later two trustees \u2013 Hannah Fry, a professor in the mathematics of cities at University College London, and Jo Foster, the director of the Institute for Research in Schools charity \u2013 resigned from the museum\u2019s board in protest at its deal with Adani.\nFry said the Science Museum was \u201cgiving the false impression that scientists believe the current efforts of fossil fuel companies are sufficient to avoid disaster\u201d.\nThere have been several protests at the museum, most recently when youth activists occupied it overnight.\nAs well as scientists and academics, many others who have worked with the museum group in the past \u2013 as speakers, advisers, contributors to exhibitions or participants in events and festivals \u2013 have also signed the letter.\nIt says that although they have \u201cexcellent personal relationships\u201d with \u201ctalented and committed members of staff\u201d at the museum, they \u201ccan no longer be complicit in the policies adopted by the group\u2019s senior leadership and trustees\u201d.\nDame Mary Archer, the chair of the board of trustees at the Science Museum Group, defended its stance on Friday. \u201cGiven the scale of the climate challenge, we reject the argument that we should sever all ties with the energy sector,\u201d she said.\n\u201cEnergy companies involved with fossil fuels are causing climate change but they also have the skills, money and geographical reach to be a big part of some of the solutions. So where a company is showing a willingness to change, our leadership team believes it is valid to continue to engage, while urging these companies to show more leadership in accelerating the shift to renewables instead of fossil fuels.\u201d\nArcher acknowledged there were \u201crobust internal debates\u201d on the issue at the museum and said she fully respected critics who disagreed with the management\u2019s position. \u201cOur door remains open for the dialogue that is integral to our work, both as part of the cultural community and as a science institution, and we\u2019d encourage our critics to consider what is achieved by deplatforming,\u201d she said.\nA spokesperson for Shell defended its relationship with the museum, saying tackling the climate crisis would need \u201cunprecedented collaboration between business, government, consumers and civil society\u201d. They said the company had a \u201ccomprehensive energy transition strategy\u201d in place.\nAdani did not respond to a request for comment.",

        "content": "Legislation reviewer warns against treating mental health differently in terrorism investigations\nTerrorism should be treated in the same way as ordinary crime when it comes to any connection to mental health issues, a terrorism laws watchdog has said, as more information comes to light about the dead Liverpool bombing suspect.\nIt has become increasingly clear that Emad al-Swealmeen, who police believe blew himself up in a taxi outside Liverpool Women\u2019s hospital on Remembrance Sunday, suffered from poor mental health, with detectives revealing on Friday they had gathered evidence from his brother on his \u201crecent state of mind\u201d.\nThe Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) has criticised some in the media for rushing to speculate about the suspect\u2019s ideological motives, adding that the picture is \u201ccomplicated\u201d by his \u201creported mental health problems\u201d.\nAn overlap between terrorism and mental health issues is becoming increasingly common. Lawyers for Khairi Saadallah, who murdered three men in Reading in 2020, unsuccessfully argued the attack was driven by a mental health disorder, not terrorist motives. Similarly, lawyers for Mahdi Mohamud, who injured three in stabbings at Manchester Victoria station in 2018, unsuccessfully argued that his schizophrenia had made him more vulnerable to radicalisation.\nJonathan Hall QC, the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, told the Guardian it was a complex area but that it was not unknown for individuals with a wide range of criminal offending to have mental health difficulties and they were not treated differently as a result.\n\u201cThe fundamental difficulty is: do you want to keep terrorism as part of the general criminal law? The answer is probably yes,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople find the criminal process obviously very frustrating and is full of delays but it commands confidence.\n\u201cIf you start saying mental health has a different impact on terrorism than on ordinary crime then you begin to unmoor it, don\u2019t you? If one was to say in an intuitive way: \u2018Surely it\u2019s different?\u2019 Well, I would just question that.\n\u201cPeople who are mentally ill or have neurological or developmental issues, they may be as capable as you or I of holding down a job, falling in love, and I\u2019m afraid also committing a crime or committing a terrorist offence.\u201d\nHall said the debate could get caught in \u201cdifficult definitional issues\u201d but ultimately if someone used a suicide belt to kill innocent members of the public, it was highly likely an ideological cause that led them to take that step would be found.\nHe agreed that part of the difficulty was that methods of terrorism had shifted from 9/11 style attacks directed by global networks to \u201cself-initiators\u201d \u2013 sometimes referred to as lone actors \u2013 springing attacks on the streets after being radicalised online in their bedrooms.\n\u201cNo one is truly on their own,\u201d Hall said. \u201cThis guy obviously had access to bomb manuals. On the assumption he was radicalised, he\u2019s networked through the internet. He could have been recruited or he could have decided to go down that dark tunnel by himself.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cIt would be a brave person to say in order to avoid the demoralising effect, to take the wind out of the sails of the terrorists, let\u2019s not call it terrorism.\u201d\nPolice investigating the Liverpool bombing have said Swealmeen experienced episodes of mental ill-health and they were still trying to understand what part this played in the attack. A Mersey Care NHS foundation trust spokesperson confirmed he had previously accessed its services but was not a service user at the time of the incident, while those who knew him, such as Kate Hindley, who met Swealmeen through church, said he made \u201cno secret\u201d of his mental health struggles.\nThe MCB has suggested the rush to pin an ideological cause on the attack when there are other factors at play has damaged relations with the Muslim community. A spokesperson said: \u201cSince 9/11, there has been an unfortunate tendency to resort to feverish speculation once a suspected terrorist attack, or terrorist-style attack, occurs. This has taken a turn for the worse with social media amplifying or becoming the source of speculation.\n\u201cRather than allow the authorities to conduct a thorough investigation of such incidents, there are some divisive commentators and thinktanks who would much prefer that we rush to name, blame and shame the perpetrator.\u201d\nThey added: \u201cAfter Sunday\u2019s attack, we saw this again with newspapers suggesting this was Islamist-inspired, that Remembrance Day services were targeted and that Muslims were not doing enough. Now we are hearing that the situation is much more complicated for this Christian convert with reported mental health problems.\n\u201cThe desire to feed the beast of speculation has a real world impact on Muslim communities who fear backlash. The media has a moral obligation to resist speculation after such incidents and question those who seek to apportion blame.\u201d",

        "content": "Analysis: the authoritarian PM\u2019s first retreat is a much needed triumph of democracy\n\u201cThe strongman finally blinks,\u201d was how one commentator put it. On Friday morning, India woke to a surprise announcement by the prime minister, Narendra Modi, that he was repealing the farm laws, which have been at the heart of one of the greatest challenges his government had faced in almost eight years in power.\nIt was a significant turning point, not only for the farmers, but for Indian politics and the reputation of the Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) government. Since Modi was first elected in 2014, his modus operandi has been that of a tough, unyielding, authoritarian strongman leader who does not bow to public pressure.\nModi did not apologise after the catastrophic policy of demonetisation in 2016, when millions of banknotes were suddenly taken out of circulation, strangling the economy. His response to opposition in the disputed region of Kashmir, after his government unilaterally stripped it of its semi-autonomous status in 2019, was to bring in hundreds of thousands of troops and implement an ongoing crackdown. He did not back down later that year when millions of people took to the streets after his government passed a citizenship law seen as prejudicial to Muslims. Nor did he apologise for the mistakes and government missteps during the devastating second wave of Covid in April.\nYet on Friday, there was Modi, in a rare tone of contrition, apologising to farmers, \u201cwith a pure heart and honest mind, that something may have fallen short\u201d.\nHis conciliatory words of retreat have sounded hollow to many farmers. After millions of them rose up in opposition to the laws, Modi\u2019s government has spent the past year throwing the full weight of the state at farmers to try to crush the dissent.\nThere was police brutality, teargas and water cannon to stop them entering Delhi. There were hundreds of arrests and police cases against farmers and activists supporting their cause. There were government statements against figures such as the popstar Rihanna and the environmentalist Greta Thunberg, who had voiced support for the farmers.\nThe government intervened to stop people tweeting to support the farmers. In parliament and at political rallies, ruling-party MPs repeatedly called the protesting farmers terrorists, Sikh separatists and anti-nationals who were conspiring against India and working for Pakistan.\nBut for the first time, none of it worked. The proud and equally headstrong farmers, mostly from Punjab and Haryana, led by powerful unions, had made it very clear to Modi they would not be moved or disappear quietly. And unlike the other protests and challenges since 2014, this time the BJP had begun to pay a heavy political price.\nModi\u2019s climbdown is seen by most as strategic political manoeuvring before the state elections in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab next year, rather than driven by sympathy for the farmers. After recent poor performances in the West Bengal and Himachal Pradesh state elections, the BJP are already seen to be on the back foot. Keeping power in Uttar Pradesh, India\u2019s most populous state and the heartland of the BJP, is crucial for Modi.\nBut the farm laws, and the perceived mistreatment of the farmers \u2013 who hold a reverential place in Indian society \u2013 had clearly begun to erode BJP support in an already tight Uttar Pradesh election race, not helped by the farmers\u2019 unions who had pledged to put all their efforts into taking votes away from the BJP. The situation became even more dire for the BJP after four peacefully protesting farmers were run down and killed in Uttar Pradesh last month, seemingly on purpose, and the son of a senior BJP minister was arrested in connection with the deaths. The attack repulsed even those not sympathetic to the farmers.\nModi\u2019s perceived surrender is sure to dent his reputation as a strongman to whom no dirt sticks. But for many, the greater significance is that it has reaffirmed that the power that sustained protest and struggle \u2013 the basis on which independent India was built \u2013 still holds. Under Modi, dissent has been systematically and successfully crushed through an authoritarian mix of draconian legislation and state machinery. Activists and critics are regularly jailed under terrorism laws, civil society groups have been hounded and shut down and protests are repeatedly met with force.\nFriday\u2019s retreat was therefore hailed as a rare and much-needed triumph of democracy, in an India otherwise sliding fast towards authoritarianism. As one protesting farmer said proudly on Friday: \u201cIn us, Modi has met his match.\u201d",

But the combative language around previous meetings between David Frost, the UK\u2019s Brexit minister, and the European Commission vice-president Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d had been dropped as the two chief negotiators talked in Brussels on Friday.\nIn a statement, Lord Frost said while \u201csignificant gaps\u201d remained, there was \u201cthe potential to generate some momentum in our discussions\u201d. \u201cLooking forward, the United Kingdom\u2019s preference remains to secure a solution based on consensus,\u201d he said.\nThe European Commission, in a post-meeting statement, reiterated a call for a reciprocal \u201cmove\u201d by Boris Johnson\u2019s government following the EU\u2019s proposal in October to cut out most checks on goods coming from Britain. The commission added that it was \u201cessential that the recent change in tone now leads to joint tangible solutions in the framework of the protocol\u201d.\nBut the EU did not double down on the claim made just a fortnight ago that the UK was failing to engage sincerely in the talks nor did \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d raise publicly the prospect of retaliatory moves should article 16 be triggered.\nBoth sides reported that there had been good progress in ensuring medicines authorised in Britain would be freely available in Northern Ireland, although there was some frustration on the EU side that agreement on that issue had not yet been found. \u201cWe now need to press on and get this crucial issue across the line,\u201d the commission said.\nFrost had earlier told reporters that he had been heartened by comments on Thursday night from the Irish taoiseach, Miche\u00e1l Martin. \u201cWhere there is a will, there is a way, and I think both sides just need to knuckle down and get it resolved,\u201d Martin said in an interview with the BBC.\nAsked whether there was any prospect of a compromise solution on the UK\u2019s demand that the European court of justice lose its role as arbiter of disputes over EU law in Northern Ireland, Frost was conciliatory.\nHe said: \u201cIt\u2019s not an issue that we have managed to discuss very much so far. We have very different positions. But I know the taoiseach said last night that the EU had serious intent to resolve the difficulties that we\u2019re facing, and I think that\u2019s very good thing that we take that very seriously.\u201d\nMeanwhile, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, criticised the commission for failing to defend the interests of its fishers operating in UK coastal waters, while his maritime minister said Paris would \u201cfight\u201d for their rights.\nMacron, who faces an election in April, told reporters during a visit to northern France that the UK should be forced to fulfil its treaty obligations. He said: \u201cWe did not get what we wanted. They are playing with our nerves.\u201d\nThe French government claims it is due a further 150 licences for vessels operating in the waters of the UK and Jersey, a British crown dependency. \u201cWe will continue to fight every day to get what should be ours and so that those 150 licences arrive,\u201d the French maritime minister, Annick Girardin, told France Inter radio.\nThe Northern Ireland protocol in the withdrawal agreement that Johnson signed keeps the region in the single market and draws a customs border down the Irish Sea in order to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. In October, the EU offered to drastically reduce the number of checks on goods coming from Great Britain to Northern Ireland in recognition of the political and economic disruption being caused.\nOn Friday, \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d said: \u201cThese measures would create a type of \u2018express lane\u2019 which would substantially facilitate trade between all parties. A win-win situation for all. It is a unique and completely new model for how goods can be moved from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, one that would strengthen opportunities for people and businesses alike.\u201d\nFrost and \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d will meet again next Friday.",

One day in the late 1960s, while at university in London, I was reading the Daily Telegraph sports section in the university refectory. A fellow student put the Guardian down in front of me, open at one of David\u2019s match reports. He told me to read it and assured me that, having read it, I would only buy the Guardian in future. Fifty-four years later, I\u2019m still buying the Guardian every day. Graham Russell Market Drayton, Shropshire\n How very sad to hear the news that the wonderful David Lacey has died. His writing was always the first I would turn to in the sports section. Richard Williams (David Lacey never wasted words \u2013 he used them to enrich the reader, 17 November) was spot-on. My favourite was a description of the efforts of Trevor Steven as \u201cStakhanovite\u201d. I had to look it up, but have used it ever since. Robert DrakeOxford\n How sad to hear the news about David Lacey. For many of us, his unmatched football writing was the reason we stuck with the Guardian through thick and thin. His easy style and witty analysis made one turn to him first. He was also impartial and never let his support for Brighton & Hove Albion FC cloud his expertise \u2013 a trait lesser football scribes would do well to mimic.Max Bell Thame, Oxfordshire\n I was so sad to hear of the death of the greatest football writer. His description of the former Nottingham Forest player Franz\u00a0Carr as the player \u201cwith the Ferrari legs and the Skoda brain\u201d still makes me chuckle.

While he is there, the president will undergo a routine colonoscopy.\n\u201c\u2026 The vice-president will work from her office in the West Wing during this time.\u201d\nBiden left the White House before 9am. The White House said it would share results of his physical.\nJust after noon, Psaki said Biden had resumed power.\nThe president \u201cspoke with [Harris] and [Chief of staff Ron Klain] at approximately 11.35am\u201d, Psaki tweeted, adding that Biden was \u201cin good spirits and at that time resumed his duties.\n\u201cHe will remain at Walter Reed as he completes the rest of his routine physical.\u201d\nSuch temporary transfers of power have been made before. As Psaki pointed out, in 2002 and 2007, Vice-President Dick Cheney assumed the role of temporary president when George Bush had colonoscopies.\nUnsurprisingly, Donald Trump reportedly bucked accepted practice. According to his former press secretary Stephanie Grisham, the 45th president refused anesthetic when he had what was in all likelihood a colonoscopy \u2013 Grisham described a \u201cvery common procedure\u201d similar to that which Bush had \u2013 in November 2019.\nTrump, Grisham wrote, refused anesthetic because he did not want his vice-president, Mike Pence, to be even temporarily in charge. She also said Trump \u201cdid not want to be the butt of a joke\u201d.\nThe health of all presidents is closely watched. Trump\u2019s visit to Walter Reed \u2013 and its cack-handed cover-up \u2013 prompted reports he had suffered a heart attack. Past 70 when he was sworn in, Trump was the oldest president elected for a first time until Biden surpassed him.\nBiden will turn 79 later this month. After his last publicised physical, in December 2019, doctors pronounced him \u201chealthy, vigorous\u201d and \u201cfit to successfully execute the duties of the presidency\u201d.\nHe has, however, survived two brain aneurysms, the second in 1988 when he was 45. Should he become incapacitated for longer than required for a regular procedure, the 25th amendment to the US constitution provides for his replacement by Harris.\nThe amendment, which also dictates the means by which temporary power is passed, has never been invoked in full. In a book published this week, the journalist Jonathan Karl reported that senior cabinet officials discussed it in the wake of the Capitol attack, over concerns about Trump\u2019s mental health.\nHarris is the first Black, Asian woman to be vice-president, but her short spell in power on Friday came amid reports she is struggling and often at odds with Biden.\nThe White House has defended her. On Thursday, Psaki told Politico there was \u201cno question\u201d that racism and sexism were part of \u201cattacks\u201d against the VP.\nOn Thursday night, it was reported that Harris\u2019s communications director, Ashley Etienne, will leave her role in December.\nAmid intense speculation about what Etienne\u2019s departure might mean, James Clyburn of South Carolina, the House whip and a close Biden adviser, told CNN: \u201cPeople leave jobs all the time.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been a part of transitions myself at the state level. And I know that within the first several months \u2013 sometimes it takes a year \u2013 that people may find out, \u2018This is not exactly for me.\u2019 So these things tend to happen.\u201d\nBiden was due to carry out a key duty on Friday afternoon: pardoning the White House Thanksgiving turkey.",

        "content": "Repeal of \u2018black laws\u2019 designed to modernise agricultural sector is huge victory for farmers\nNarendra Modi has announced he will repeal three contentious farm laws that prompted a year of protests and unrest in India, in one of the most significant concessions made by his government.\nIn a huge victory for India\u2019s farmers, who had fought hard for the repeal of what they called the \u201cblack laws\u201d, the prime minister announced in an address on Friday morning that \u201cwe have taken the laws back\u201d.\n\u201cWe have decided to repeal all three farm laws. We will start the constitutional process to repeal all the three laws in the parliament session that starts at the end of this month,\u201d said Modi, in a surprise announcement.\nWhile Modi remained adamant in his speech that the laws were necessary reforms, he acknowledged that they were unfeasible given the fierce opposition from farmers. \u201cI appeal to all the farmers who are part of the protest \u2026 to now return to your home, to your loved ones, to your farms, and family. Let\u2019s make a fresh start and move forward,\u201d he added.\nModi had passed the three farm laws in 2020 in an attempt to overhaul India\u2019s archaic agriculture sector by rolling back farm subsidies and price regulation on crops. The agriculture sector still employs about 60% of India\u2019s workforce, but is riddled with issues of poverty, debt and inefficiency.\nHowever, they quickly became a major source of contention among India\u2019s millions of farmers, who accused the government of passing the laws without consultation. They said the reforms put their livelihoods and farms at risk and gave private corporations control over the pricing of their crops, which could crush smallholder farmers.\nAfter the government refused to repeal the laws last year, hundreds of thousands of farmers marched to Delhi\u2019s borders, met on the way with barricades, teargas and water cannon, and set up protest camps along the main highways into the capital.\nTens of thousands of farmers have remained at the several camps around Delhi borders ever since, maintaining one of the most sustained challenges to the Modi government, even through the harsh winters, baking summers and the brutal second wave of Covid-19. They found support in huge swathes of India, as well as internationally, with figures including Rihanna and Greta Thunberg speaking out in support of their actions, much to the chagrin of the government. The protests turned violent in February when the farmers stormed into the centre of Delhi and briefly took over the historic Red Fort in the old city centre.\nThe government had made concerted efforts to crush the farmer protest movement over the past year. Farmers and supportive activists were arrested and police made several threats to clear the protest camps around Delhi, before briefly resorting to barricading in the farmers with concrete barriers and spikes. Those leading the protests were regularly cast as terrorists and anti-nationals conspiring against India.\nAfter several rounds of negotiations failed, the government agreed to suspend the laws earlier this year, but the farmers, who have the backing of powerful unions, said they would not budge until the laws were repealed entirely.\nOn Friday, farmer leader Rakesh Tikait said the farmers would still not disband their protest camps and rallies until the act of repealing the laws had been carried out in parliament. He also emphasised that more than 700 farmers had died over the past year during the protests against the farm laws.\n\u201cAt last, all of our hard work paid off \u2026 I salute the farmer brothers who were martyred in this battle,\u201d said Tikait.\nPreviously the Modi government had said it would not bow down to pressure from the farmers over the farm laws. Modi, a strongman prime minister, has until now been unyielding to all mass protests and challenges to his government.\nHowever, it is thought that Modi\u2019s decision to rollback the laws and make a rare public apology is tied to upcoming crucial state elections in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab, where farmers make up a crucial proportion of the \u201cvote bank\u201d and farmers\u2019 unions hold significant power and influence. The farm laws had caused a lot of anger in the north Indian states that are the heartland of Modi\u2019s ruling Bharatiya Janata party (BJP).\nAshutosh Varshney, director of the Centre for Contemporary South Asia at Brown University, said it was the Uttar Pradesh elections \u201cpure and simple\u201d that had motivated the decision.\n\u201cIf the BJP loses Uttar Pradesh in March, it will open up politics in a way that can have huge implications in 2024 [the general election].\u201d\nVarshney said the rollback made Modi look \u201cpotentially vulnerable, not yet decidedly weak\u201d, adding: \u201cThis is his first reversal when faced with a movement. \u201cIt will encourage other movements but Modi will back down only if the protest threatens the BJP electorally. Otherwise Modi can ride it out.\u201d\nAn opposition MP, Palaniappan Chidambaram, said in a tweet: \u201cPM\u2019s announcement on the withdrawal of the three farm laws is not inspired by a change of policy or a change of heart. It is impelled by fear of elections!\u201d\nIn his speech, Modi said he was repealing the laws because he lamented that the government had been \u201cunable to convince farmers\u201d.\n\u201cWhatever I did was for farmers,\u201d the prime minister said. \u201cWhat I am doing is for the country.\u201d\nAmarinder Singh, former chief minister of Punjab state, which is home to many of the protesting farmers, tweeted: \u201cThankful to PM Narendra Modi \u2026 for acceding to the demands of every Punjabi.\u201d",

The vote went almost wholly along party lines, 220 to 213, with Jared Golden of Maine the sole Democrat to oppose it.\nRepublican minority leader Kevin McCarthy had derailed the schedule to vote on Thursday by delivering a marathon overnight speech of eight hours 32 minutes. It was the longest speech ever made on the House floor but could only delay rather than deny the inevitable.\nThe House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, triumphantly brought down her gavel to mark the bill\u2019s passage to enthusiastic applause throughout the chamber from Democratic members. There were chants of, \u201cBuild Back Better! Build Back Better!\u201d\n\u201cThe Build Back Better Act is passed,\u201d Pelosi announced minutes later, smiling with arm aloft, to more cheering and chants of \u201cNancy! Nancy! Nancy!\u201d\nSoon after, a triumphant Pelosi said at a press conference: \u201cWe will be telling our children and grandchildren that we were here this day.\u201d\nThe bill is \u201cmonumental, it\u2019s historic, it\u2019s transformative, it\u2019s bigger than anything we\u2019ve ever done,\u201d she added.\nOn climate crisis action, Pelosi said: \u201cIf you care about the planet and how we pass it on, this bill is for you.\u201d\nPresident Biden will transfer power to Vice President Kamala Harris for the brief period of time when he is under anesthesia today while getting a colonoscopy, the White House says. \u201cThe Vice President will work from her office in the West Wing during this time.\u201d\nThe Build Back Better Act provides hundreds of billions to new social programs and action to mitigate the effects and worsening of the climate crisis.\nOutside the US Capitol, progressive leader and Democratic congresswoman Pramila Jayapal said there was not agreement on every element of the bill but that she was pleased with the overwhelming support.\nShe called the bill \u201ca very strong vote to send to the Senate\u201d.\nSouth Carolina congressman James Clyburn, who was instrumental in shepherding Black voters to support Joe Biden when he was struggling in the primaries during the 2020 campaign, eventually seeing him win the nomination and the White House, spoke of \u201ca good day\u201d as he appeared alongside Pelosi after Friday\u2019s vote.\n.@SpeakerPelosi: \"The Build Back Better Bill is passed.\"The House of Representatives passes President Biden's Social Spending Plan. The bill goes now to the U.S. Senate. pic.twitter.com/zxTxPCPz70\nThe bill now goes to the Senate, where it faces total opposition from Republicans and an uphill battle, in its current form, against centrist Democratic senators Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona.\nThe Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, has indicated that he wants the bill to pass the Senate, return to the House and be on the president\u2019s desk by Christmas for signing, a tall order with more fierce debate yet to come and a crowded legislative calendar on Capitol Hill in December.\nThe huge bill will use the reconciliation process for budgetary-related legislation, meaning it can be passed in the Senate with a simple majority, rather than a 60-vote threshold, so that Democrats alone can see it through the chamber if they support it.\nBut in a hint of the wrangling to come, Bernie Sanders, an independent senator for Vermont, said: \u201cThe Senate has an opportunity to make this a truly historic piece of legislation. We will listen to the demands of the American people and strengthen the Build Back Better Act.\u201d\nThe package is ambitious: it aims to dramatically reduce childcare costs, provide universal pre-kindergarten for children, lower the cost of prescription drugs for seniors, expand Medicare to cover hearing aids, extend work permits to millions of undocumented immigrants and provide the largest-ever investment in efforts to combat the climate crisis.\nThe House version of the legislation also includes four weeks of paid family and medical leave, though the provision faces opposition from Manchin.\nPelosi told reporters: \u201cWe had so much agreement within the bill \u2026 and then whatever comes out in the Senate, we\u2019ll be working together with them so that we have agreement when it comes back to us. The biggest challenge was to meet the vision of President Biden.\u201d\nFive days ago Biden signed the bipartisan $1.2tn infrastructure bill into law at the White House, dealing with rebuilding America\u2019s roads and bridges and spreading broadband internet.\nThe president is attending Walter Reed hospital for a routine medical check on Friday, the day before his 79th birthday.\nHis medical required a colonoscopy, which required going under anesthesia. As such, he briefly transferred power to the vice-president, Kamala Harris, the first time the US has had, albeit briefly, a woman as acting president.\nJen Psaki, the White House press secretary, tweeted that Biden had spoken to Harris at about 11.35am, adding:\u201c@POTUS was in good spirits and at that time resumed his duties. He will remain at Walter Reed as he completes the rest of his routine physical.\u201d",

        "content": "Attacker used aliases to buy parts for device, which may have detonated prematurely, police say\nThe suspected Liverpool bomber packed his homemade explosive device with ball bearings to cause maximum deaths and injuries, police have said.\nEmad al-Swealmeen, 32, died on Sunday when a taxi he had hired drove to Liverpool Women\u2019s hospital and exploded outside the entrance.\nAn intensive investigation by counter-terrorism police and MI5 leaves investigators currently believing:\nSwealmeen bought items for the homemade bomb in person from stores around Liverpool over a period of months.\nHe also had multiple phones and devices and used those to purchase items for the explosive device online.\nPart of the device contained the homemade explosive HMTD, used in some previous devices such as that used in the 7 July 2005 bombs to attack the London transport system. It is believed other homemade explosives were also in the device.\nSwealmeen, who had claimed asylum after arriving in the UK, had shown signs he was following his birth religion of Islam again, after going through ceremonies to convert to Christianity in 2015 and 2017.\nHe used his birth name as well as the name he took on converting to Christianity, Enzo Almeni, and other aliases to make the purchases needed to construct the improvised explosive device.\nPolice said it was possible the homemade bomb exploded because of \u201cthe movement of the vehicle or its stopping\u201d, and thus before Swealmeen had intended it to detonate.\nThe explosion was declared a terrorist incident but more than five days later, police cannot say what ideology or cause spurred the attack.\nIt is highly unusual to find no evidence of ideology after several days of a terrorism investigation. But the nature of the device, with ball bearings meant to turn into shrapnel, is seen as a clear sign of murderous intent.\nRelatives of Swealmeen, originally from the Middle East, have been tracked down by investigators and have given details of his life, as have other people who knew him.\nRuss Jackson, an assistant chief constable and head of counter-terrorism police in the north-west, said: \u201cOfficers spoke with the brother of al-Swealmeen yesterday evening [Thursday] and this has given us an insight into his early years and an understanding of al-Swealmeen\u2019s life and his recent state of mind, which is an important line of investigation.\u201d\nJackson said examination of what was left in the cab and of two Liverpool addresses linked to Swealmeen had started to give police clues about the nature of the bomb and how it was put together. Jackson said: \u201cIt was made using homemade explosive and had ball bearings attached to it which would have acted as shrapnel. Had it detonated in different circumstances we believe it would have caused significant injury or death.\u201d\nInvestigators are not certain about the target, but lean towards it being the maternity hospital rather than a Remembrance Day event under a mile from where the cab stopped just before 11am.\nJackson said: \u201cWe still do not know how or why the device exploded when it did, but we are not discounting it being completely unintentional, and it is a possibility that the movement of the vehicle or its stopping caused the ignition. We are spending considerable time seeking to understand the way the purchases for the ingredients to make the device were made. This is complicated because purchases have spanned many months and al-Swealmeen has used many aliases.\u201d\nSo far police have found no evidence that anyone else was involved. Four men who were arrested by counter-terrorism detectives have been eliminated as suspects.\nThe explosion and revelations that someone had been plotting since April to attack the north-west caused anxiety in the region, where in 2017 the Manchester Arena bombing killed 22 people. Jackson tried to provide reassurance: \u201cWe have found no connection between this incident and the terrible events of Manchester in May 2017. The device was also different to the one used in the Manchester Arena attack.\u201d\nPolice have said Swealmeen experienced episodes of mental ill-health and they were still trying to understand what part this played in the attack.\nThe taxi driver who drove Swealmeen fled the cab after the device detonated.\nThe explosion, the second incident to be declared one of terrorism in a month after the killing of the MP Sir David Amess, led to the UK\u2019s terrorism threat level being raised to severe, meaning an attack is highly likely.",

He received a life sentence for raping and killing Lynda Mann and Dawn Ashworth, both 15, in Leicestershire in 1983 and 1986.\nA Probation Service spokesperson said: \u201cProtecting the public is our No 1 priority so when offenders breach the conditions of their release and potentially pose an increased risk, we don\u2019t hesitate to return them to custody.\u201d\nThere was an outcry when Pitchfork was released from prison in September following an unsuccessful campaign to keep him behind bars.\nIt is understood the breach of his licence conditions did not involve a fresh criminal act and nor did it require police to become involved, other than to arrest him so he could be returned to prison. Officials declined to say what the concerning behaviour was and it is understood the families of his victims were being contacted to be briefed.\nTypical licence conditions for a serious offender such as Pitchfork include regular reporting to police and probation, restrictions on where they can go and declaring all electronic devices in their possession.\nAt the time of his release, Dawn\u2019s mother, Barbara Ashworth, spoke out against the decision to free him, saying: \u201cLife should have meant life.\u201d\nOn Friday, she told the PA Media news agency: \u201cI\u2019m pleased that he\u2019s been put away and women and girls are safe and protected from him now. It\u2019s a safer place when he\u2019s behind bars and I won\u2019t have to worry about other people being hurt by him for the time being. But there\u2019s always the worry that he might get out again, he seems to have a lot of people on his side who give him the benefit of the doubt. But for now, I have to be pleased about the news.\u201d\nPitchfork was caught after the world\u2019s first mass screening for DNA, when 5,000 men in three villages were asked to volunteer blood or saliva samples, although he initially evaded justice by getting a colleague to take the test for him.\nThe Parole Board ruled he was \u201csuitable for release\u201d at a hearing in March despite this being denied in 2016 and 2018. He was placed on the sex offender register and was subject to other licence conditions.\nIn July the Parole Board rejected calls from the government to reconsider the decision. Robert Buckland, the then justice secretary, had formally asked it to reconsider the move on the grounds there was an arguable case the decision was \u201cirrational\u201d.\nThe government plans to overhaul the parole system, with the findings of a review expected later this year. It has also sought to change legislation so child killers face life behind bars without parole.",

He was also ordered to pay \u00a335,000 within a year towards the costs of the prosecution.\nBut the former government whip, who is on licence until next year, was summonsed to attend Uxbridge magistrates court on Friday for non-payment.\n\u201cI find myself in a very difficult and embarrassed position,\u201d he told the court, asking magistrates to \u201cgive me time to the end of my sentence to get myself back on my feet\u201d.\nThe court heard that most of the \u00a351,000 Elphicke received from the sale of his marital home had been used in legal fees and to pay six months\u2019 rent up front for a one-bedroom flat in Fulham, south-west London.\nHe told the court he had worked with the Step Change debt charity to assess his financial situation but a repayment proposal was not accepted by the court.\n\u201cI have no job, I have no career, I am long-term unemployed,\u201d said Elphicke. \u201cI am working with the jobcentre and my probation officer to find a new career. I have made a claim for universal credit. I am separated from my wife who has filed for divorce. I have had to find a new place to live.\u201d\nElphicke was convicted in July of three charges, two in relation to a parliamentary worker in 2016 and one in relation to a woman at his family\u2019s central London home in 2007. The sentencing judge described Elphicke as \u201ca sexual predator who used [\u2026] success and respectability as a cover\u201d.\nDuring the trial, jurors heard that his first victim had suffered a \u201cterrifying episode\u201d when he assaulted her, then chased her round his home chanting: \u201cI\u2019m a naughty Tory\u201d.\nIn March, Elphicke lost a court of appeal challenge against his jail term after his lawyers argued the sentence was too long and should have been suspended.\nIn the wake of the case, the Commons Standards Committee found five Conservatives had breached the code of conduct over an \u201cegregious\u201d attempt to influence his legal proceedings. They were his wife, Natalie, who stood for office and became the Conservative MP for Dover after her husband did not stand in 2019, Sir Roger Gale, Theresa Villiers, Bob Stewart and Adam Holloway.\nMagistrates agreed to adjourn the case to 17 December, while Elphicke is waiting for his benefits claim to be assessed, with a payment order expected to be made at the next hearing.\n This article was amended on 20 November 2021. Charlie Elphicke ceased to be an MP in 2019, not \u201clast year\u201d as an earlier version said.",

They include brass plaques, bronze figures, carved ivory tusks, musical instruments, weaving equipment, jewellery, and ceramic and coral objects dating to the 13th century.\nA further 15 objects may have been taken during the military raid but their provenance has not been established, an interim report by Dan Hicks, a curator at the museum, said.\n\u201cThe work of restitution begins in part with the sharing of knowledge,\u201d said the report. \u201cThe restitution of African cultural heritage is of the utmost importance in the 2020s.\u201d Moves by museums \u201cto embrace the importance of transparency about looted African collections\u201d were welcome.\nLast month, Jesus College, Cambridge and Aberdeen University became the first British institutions to return Benin bronzes to Nigeria. Germany has also agreed to hand back Benin bronzes next year.\nLai Mohammed, Nigeria\u2019s minister of information and culture, said: \u201cWe look forward to a similar return of our artefacts by other institutions that are in possession of them.\u201d\nAbout 10,000 objects looted during the raid on Benin are held in 165 museums and many private collections across the world. The British Museum in London holds 900 objects, the largest collection in the world.\nThe 145 objects in the care of the Pitt Rivers Museum represented less than 1.5% of the objects taken in the attack, Hicks\u2019 report noted.\nIt said: \u201cThe chaotic theft of royal and sacred artworks and other items by perhaps up to two hundred soldiers, sailors and administrators during the sacking of Benin City in the British naval expedition of 1897 is one of the most well-known examples of the widespread practice of military looting by European troops in the later 19th and early 20th centuries.\u201d\nEarlier this year, a statement from Oxford University said the Pitt Rivers Museum had been \u201cworking with Nigerian stakeholders \u2026 to identify best ways forward regarding the care and return of these objects\u201d.\nThe work was part of efforts to \u201cidentify collections that were taken as part of military violence or looting, or otherwise contentious circumstances and engage in conversations with external partners about the future care of these objects\u201d.",

        "content": "The hilly capital has an inordinately high number of incline lifts and more are being built as easily accessible sites become harder to find\nSome look like glass elevators plucked from a science-fiction film, others a giant fibreglass bucket, but however they come, Wellington\u2019s personal cable cars are more than just an alternative to scaling the hilly capital\u2019s interminable steps; they are a small slice of daily magic for the hundreds of people who use them.\n\u201cThere\u2019s something very romantic about coming home late from a party, and deciding to take the cable car up to the house,\u201d Vogeltown resident Rose Lu says.\n\u201cIt feels like I\u2019m in one of those touristy ferris wheels: I can look out along Liardet Street, and there\u2019s a hint of the ocean at the top of the ride.\u201d\nFor a city of just 215,000 people, Wellington has an inordinately high number of personal cable cars, or incline lifts \u2013 152 at last count. In other countries, this private mode of transport is typically reserved for luxury properties \u2013 the hills of Los Angeles, or along the seaside cliffs of Sydney \u2013 but in Wellington, cable cars snaking up suburban slopes are a common sight.\nFinding a house with a cable car wasn\u2019t on the shortlist of must-haves when Lu and her partner were house-hunting. But the property they chose came with one, despite there being a relatively modest 80 steps up to the house.\n\u201cWe were a bit perplexed as to why there was a cable car installed, because the access to the house isn\u2019t bad for Wellington. Later, we found out that the previous owner got the cable car installed for accessibility reasons,\u201d Lu says.\n\u201cMy mum made me promise to never get rid of it because she wasn\u2019t getting any younger, so the stairs wouldn\u2019t be getting easier.\u201d\nFor Hataitai resident Jess Hunt a cable car was an added bonus when she went looking for a rental. \u201cIt kind of goes through the trees and it\u2019s quiet. You feel like you\u2019re arriving at a little sanctuary because you\u2019re ascending or descending silently,\u201d she says.\nThe cable car services three houses, with drop-off stations for each. Last month, it presented her flat with a unique Halloween party opportunity.\n\u201cWe were sitting in the cable car talking about the Halloween party and then we were like, we should theme the cable car and turn it into like a ghost ride.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I thought, why don\u2019t we just get Grim Reaper? I wanted it to be this descending into the underworld type thing.\u201d\nHunt put an advertisement out to the student community, offering to pay someone to take on the role. The winning candidate was \u201cperfect\u201d, staying in character for more than two hours, and playing his own spooky music for ambience, as he ferried souls up and down the slope.\nRoughly 300 personal cable cars once dotted the city\u2019s hills, but regulation was introduced in 2005 after a Wellington family survived a 10-metre plunge when their cable car engine failed. Some cable cars were decommissioned as a result.\nFor a few households, it is the only means of access to their home, which can present difficulties to emergency services staff.\nPete Burtonwood, who retired from the fire service 18 months ago, was responsible for creating a database of Wellington\u2019s residential cable cars, so that in the event of a call-out, officers knew what to expect.\n\u201cSome of them are alongside pathways going to the house, but some of them have completely taken away that normal foot access,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a challenge.\u201d\nThe weight-limits in cable cars are also restrictive. The maximum Burtonwood saw in his time was 350kg.\n\u201cTwo average firefighters and their full kit with some basic equipment is probably around about 250 kilos. Picture 2am, there\u2019s no light, you\u2019re trying to get a hose down there \u2013 there is a whole scenario of things that are challenging.\u201d\nAccess Automation is the company that manufactures and installs the vast majority of the country\u2019s residential cable cars. Its owner, Mark Galvin, who has been in the business for 25 years, says cable cars have always been a feature of the city, but they were relatively rudimentary in the early days.\n\u201cTraditionally cable cars would just be a straight rail that would go up the hill, and people would modify the contour of the land to suit a straight line. We can make them bend and twist and follow the topography of the ground,\u201d Galvin says.\nThe demand for cable cars has risen, he says, as they can add value to a property, but also because the easy-access sites in Wellington are becoming harder to find.\nThe longest cable car he is aware of is 200 metres, which services a set of apartments in Oriental Bay.\n\u201cIt basically transforms what was a difficult, gnarly access, to something that really is fun and quite exciting. It\u2019s a spectacular way to arrive home,\u201d Galvin says.\nInstalling one can cost about $150,000 to $200,000, depending on the terrain, and there are maintenance costs on top. Lu had no idea servicing a cable car would be so expensive.\n\u201cIt costs more to maintain the cable car than a regular car, which we don\u2019t even own, and it only travels about 20 metres. Each of the concrete foundations is $30,000 to $40,000 to replace so we were warned about keeping them tidy.\u201d\nThe annual cable car warrant of fitness costs $850. \u201cExorbitant costs aside, I really do love the cable car,\u201d Lu says.\n\u201cI sometimes come home and find the cable car in a different position than I had left it, and deduce that a courier has used it to take a package up to the house, and I\u2019m glad that it brings joy and a little bit of relief to other people\u2019s days as well.\u201d",

        "content": "There is renewed hope for closure in one of Australia\u2019s most notorious missing persons cases \u2013 and the country is transfixed\nSeven years, two months and seven days after three-year-old William Tyrrell went missing, a swarm of police cars are still parked outside the house where he was last seen, looking for him.\nParked on curbs and dirt paths in Kendall, the usually quiet town four hours north of Sydney, where houses have large front yards and gardens back into bushland, dozens of detective and forensics cars are revisiting one of Australia\u2019s most notorious missing persons cases \u2013 and the country is transfixed.\nThere are two new icons in town surrounded by police tape \u2013 the former home of William\u2019s late foster grandmother, and stretches of bush along a creek about 1km away.\nExcavators, electronic sifters, pump engines and shovels disrupt the sound of birds and cicadas chirping.\nFresh evidence that has revived the investigation and triggered a search this week has also brought renewed hope for closure. Exactly what that new evidence is has not been revealed by police.\nPolice are understood to be focused on one person of interest in the case. They are also understood to be exploring the possibility William fell from the balcony of the home he was playing at.\nIn addition to the new search activity, detectives announced they seized a grey Mazda in Sydney\u2019s south that previously belonged to the mother of William\u2019s foster mother. It is understood they believe the car may be linked to the new search areas they are exploring.\nThe case has destroyed families across Sydney and Kendall and churned through three separate chief detectives in charge of the investigation, been the subject of a coronial inquest, attracted the attention of thousands of volunteer searchers and millions of Australians who have been unable to answer the question of how the three-year-old could just disappear.\nThe first police car arrived at Benaroon Drive in Kendall at 11.06am on Friday 12 September 2014, 10 minutes after William\u2019s foster mother called police to report him as missing.\nLess than an hour earlier, the toddler was wearing a Spider-Man suit and singlet, and had been crawling around and roaring, pretending to be a \u201cdaddy tiger\u201d.\nAt 9.37am, William\u2019s foster mother took three photos of him appearing \u201cspider manned out\u201d, she would later tell the coronial inquest, with the pictures becoming the key image associated with public awareness campaigns pleading for members of the public to come forward with information.\nThe Sydney family had travelled to Kendall to spend time with their newly widowed foster grandmother when suddenly his foster mother stopped hearing him playing, in a timeframe police believe occurred between 10.05am and 10.20am.\n\u201cI heard (a) roar, it sounded really loud and close like he was just around the corner,\u201d the foster mother told police after his disappearance. \u201cAfter a couple of minutes, I thought \u2018oh he is quiet\u2019.\n\u201cIt was only a matter of a few minutes ... I don\u2019t understand how he could disappear so quickly,\u201d she said.\nWilliam\u2019s foster father had left the home at 9.30am to drive out of the town to find better mobile reception for a Skype call and to fill a script at a chemist \u2013 actions which have been verified by police.\nBy the time he arrived back at the home, his wife has said she had already searched the house and garden for him, and had then taken her mother\u2019s car and driven it down Benaroon Drive looking for him, before returning, figuring he couldn\u2019t have travelled that far from the home.\nA search party of concerned locals quickly formed and with the police they failed to find the lost boy.\nThey found nothing.\nAs the initial search stretched from days to weeks into months and turned up nothing, the police strike force set up to investigate William\u2019s disappearance received a new chief \u2013 Gary Jubelin.\nJubelin has become synonymous with William\u2019s disappearance, and his career unravelled with the case.\nThe bald, black-suit-wearing detective had become the face of the police investigation into William. He was considered one of the most high-profile homicide detectives in Australia, having had success in locating the remains of Matthew Leveson in 2017, 10 years after the 20-year-old went missing after visiting a nightclub in 2007.\nUnder Jubelin\u2019s command, the investigation moved through hundreds of \u201cpersons of interest\u201d who were ultimately ruled out, including one local maintenance worker who would later initiate defamation proceedings over how he felt the media reported police\u2019s pursuance of him.\nNotoriously, Jubelin was found to have made secret audio recordings when pursuing another person of interest \u2013 a neighbour of the foster grandmother\u2019s \u2013 actions which saw him removed from the case in 2019, convicted of misconduct, and ultimately retire as a detective. The person Jubelin recorded is no longer a person of interest in the case.\nThis week, amid the renewed police search, Jubelin went on Sydney radio to defend his handling of the investigation after the state\u2019s police commissioner, Mick Fuller, spoke on the same station and said the team that took over from Jubelin \u201cinherited what was a bit of a mess\u201d.\nJubelin took issue with Fuller\u2019s comments, saying he provided monthly progress reports to his superior officers detailing everything \u2013 \u201cwhat suspects I was targeting, what the future directions were\u201d. He also said he had investigated all theories, including that William had died in an accident, but he said any theory had to be backed up with facts.\nAlready, the case had been shrouded in mystery.\nIt was only in 2017 that a supreme court judge ruled in favour of allowing William\u2019s foster care status to be reported, a development which resulted in further details about William\u2019s biological family being made public.\nWilliam had been taken into foster care following concerns about the environment he was being brought up in. However, his biological parents attempted to hide him, going on the run for several weeks before being arrested.\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t bring myself to give them my son,\u201d his biological mother would tell the coronial inquest into her son\u2019s disappearance in 2019.\nHis biological parents have been ruled out as persons of interest in his disappearance, however the impact on them was profound. They would later split up, and his biological family has made claims throughout the investigation and legal process about their access to the case.\n \nEmail:\u00a0sign up for our\u00a0daily morning and afternoon email newsletters\nApp:\u00a0download our free app\u00a0and never miss the biggest stories\nSocial:\u00a0follow us on YouTube,\u00a0TikTok,\u00a0Instagram,\u00a0Facebook\u00a0or\u00a0Twitter\nPodcast:\u00a0listen to our daily episodes on\u00a0Apple Podcasts,\u00a0Spotify\u00a0or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app\n\u201cWilliam\u2019s father hasn\u2019t been the same since he disappeared \u2013 in a way, two sons have been lost,\u201d William\u2019s biological father\u2019s mother told the inquest.\nEven in the initial search for William, in the days after he went missing, it has been reported that his biological parents were not able to legally join the search because if he was found they would be in a situation where they were in contact with their son without the presence of case workers legally required to supervise contact.\nThe findings of a coronial inquest into William\u2019s disappearance, which concluded last year, are yet to be handed down.\nA $1m reward for information on the case still stands.\nThis week, as police returned en masse after new evidence revived the case, the theory about what happened to William has changed, and there are some stark differences between the search that happened on the morning he disappeared and what is happening now.\nOn the Friday morning in 2014, a search party and police set out to find a boy they believed had wandered off and become lost in unfamiliar surroundings.\nInstead of concerned local citizens and scent detection dogs helping police, it is now forensic grave archaeologists, cadaver dogs, earthmovers and radars. They are looking for William\u2019s remains.\nInitially police believed that William had wandered off, and only later that he was abducted.\nHowever, Detective Chief Superintendent Darren Bennett, the man who has taken over Jubelin\u2019s role, said it\u2019s \u201chighly likely that if we found something it would be a body\u201d when announcing the new three-week search.\n\u201cWe are looking for the remains of William Tyrrell, there\u2019s no doubt about that,\u201d he said.\nSince Monday, police have set up search sites at the home on Benaroon Drive, where they searched the garden bed as well as a cement slab in a garage that was laid after William\u2019s disappearance. Forensics teams have used techniques including luminal to search for traces of blood, as well as ground-penetrating radars and 3D cameras to search for anomalies in subterranean soil.\nBy Friday, they had moved on from the home to focus on nearby bushland on Batar Creek Road. They have so far cleared one stretch of the bushland and pumped a nearby creek, and have earmarked two further neighbouring plots of bushland to explore.\nThe search team is made up of about 70 people working at any given time, including Rural Fire Service volunteers who are clearing trees and weeds, a federal police forensics imagery and geomatics team, public order and riot squad members, local detectives and ambulances.\nThey have been arriving at 8am each day, sifting through dirt until about 5pm, when they lay tarpaulin over the ground they have been looking at to protect soil from potential rain overnight.\nThey have also been joined by a forensic grave archaeologist, an anthropologist and a hydrologist \u2013 Prof Jon Olley. Olley famously helped find the remains of missing Queensland boy Daniel Morcombe.\nMorcombe was 13 when he went missing from Queensland\u2019s Sunshine Coast in 2003, and his remains were found almost eight years later.\nWhile police now believe the best outcome for Tyrrell\u2019s case would be to find his remains for evidence in a potential prosecution, the recent disappearance and discovery of missing Western Australian girl Cleo Smith has exposed key differences in how police treated the first few hours after each child was reported missing.\nWhen Cleo went missing in October, WA police treated the case as an abduction, collecting all evidence from a large radius of the remote outback camping site where she was alleged to have been taken from her family\u2019s tent.\nGarbage bins and CCTV were sifted through, and details of every car seen in the area and mobile phone that had a connection to nearby reception towers were followed up, and ultimately police stormed a home to find Cleo alive.\nHowever, in William\u2019s case, police acted differently. As they initially thought William had wandered off, the first response was a search. It meant that information about everyone in town was not captured and that movement in and out of the town was not initially paused.\nFurther, police interviews with some persons of interest took place months and years after William\u2019s disappearance.\nIt has now taken them seven years to return to the home he was last seen in to dig up the backyard and nearby bush.\nWhile police are yet to announce significant findings, there have been moments of significance for the search team.\nOn two occasions, pieces of cloth thread have been discovered and bagged up as evidence to be forensically analysed at a police lab in Sydney.\nThe first, a piece of red thread, was discovered on Wednesday, fuelling speculation it could be similar to the Spider-Man costume that William was last seen wearing. Police produced a sample Spider-Man costume to compare it to the finding, but have not yet confirmed its significance.\nLikewise, after finding a piece of light blue cloth on Friday next to a pumped creek, police are unclear of its significance. It will take several days before testing has concluded.\nBeyond those two attention-grabbing moments, the search has been a hot, long slog.\nOn Thursday, a forensic expert dug up a live snake, which he then carried away on his shovel.\nPerhaps more noticeable than any evidence gathered by police has been the local response to the latest search.\nThe memory of William hangs over the town that has been in the national interest for only this reason in recent years, and residents are weary of how many locals have been linked to the case at various points as persons of interest and later ruled out.\nOn several occasions throughout the dig so far, locals have driven by the search site shouting at the media and police gathered to leave the town.\nOn Friday afternoon, as police packed up for the day and relaid the tarpaulin over the search area, their cars drove from the unsealed Cobb and Co Road onto Batar Creek Road, leaving a cloud of dust over the search site.\nThe search for evidence continues.",

        "content": "A prime minister who is demonstrably comfortable with intervention now declares government has to get out of people\u2019s faces\nWe\u2019ll get to Scott Morrison \u201cdouble-speaking to extremists\u201d (as Daniel Andrews put it on Friday) shortly. But let\u2019s begin with Israel Folau and what Bill Shorten said back in May 2019.\nIf you\u2019ve forgotten this whole fracas, Folau posted on Instagram that homosexuals would go to hell. Rugby Australia then terminated Folau\u2019s contract. As Labor\u2019s campaign review puts it: \u201cThis triggered a debate about religious freedom and hate speech. Bill Shorten called Scott Morrison out on his failure to condemn Folau\u2019s remarks. This led to Shorten defending criticism he was seeking to embarrass Morrison because of his religion.\u201d\nBack then, Morrison was clearly courting believers. The Pentecostal prime minister had invited the media into the Horizon church at Easter only a few weeks before, and told voters during his final speech of the election campaign he would \u201cburn for them every day\u201d.\nMorrison\u2019s strategy yielded dividends. Labor, as its campaign review notes, \u201clost some support\u201d in the 2019 contest \u201camong Christian voters \u2013 particularly devout, first-generation migrant Christians\u201d. Labor MPs in western Sydney bore the brunt of this voter backlash.\nI\u2019m reminding you of this history, and this dynamic, to set up the final parliamentary sitting fortnight of 2021. Morrison at the moment looks very much like a political leader casting around for a hammer blow. Rather than sitting in any particular pocket, he\u2019s on the prowl for definitional fights, constantly market-testing what next year\u2019s election might be about.\nI suspect Morrison would like to close out the parliamentary year with a simple and satisfying fight with Labor about religious freedom. Actually let\u2019s be more precise. Morrison started out in 2018 saying he would legislate to protect religious freedom, but that objective has morphed over time to anti-discrimination measures, largely because a number of government MPs think legislating to protect religious freedom is either a solution in search of a problem, or a shield for prejudice.\nIn any case, the proposal will finally land next week. To secure his pick-a-box fight, Morrison first has to corral his own people. Some MPs pine for the original religious freedom objective, others are worried about antediluvian nasties. Bear in mind backbenchers haven\u2019t seen this bill yet, they\u2019ve only been given a general briefing.\nIf Morrison can line up his own people (checking you all logged the \u201cif\u201d in that sentence) and steer a package through the government party room without a boilover, he\u2019s on the way. The next hurdle is persuading faith leaders to endorse the proposals. Faith leaders are important, because they speak directly to the voters the prime minister is courting, but they have been underwhelmed by the government\u2019s previous attempts. If the prime minister can get some buy-in from the churches, that\u2019s useful.\nIf Morrison achieves both these things, then he will hope for a Labor eruption \u2013 a refusal to support the package, or a split. If Labor declines to rise to the bait, the next best development would be Labor sending the package off to a Senate inquiry.\nThis bill will likely need an inquiry, given the current iteration has been cooked up quickly with little or no transparency. But if Labor pulls that procedural lever, Morrison can blame the opposition for delaying the package. Morrison\u2019s script writes itself \u2013 this stalling tactic shows Labor just doesn\u2019t respect Australians with traditional values.\nBut not all Liberals are convinced the prime minister\u2019s pre-Christmas wedge is a winner. A version of this narrowcasting certainly worked electorally in 2019, but things have moved on. Morrison is no longer the new bloke in a baseball cap \u2013 a politician voters barely knew. Three years later, the prime minister is a known known. His tactics, the ingrained cynicism of some of his habits, is now an established trope of popular culture.\nAnd if the religious discrimination package is a pitch (at least in part) to voters in western Sydney, are voters likely to be receptive? Liberals have been hunting in the city\u2019s west since the Howard era. Howard\u2019s battlers. Tony\u2019s tradies. Morrison\u2019s quiet Australians.\nIn 2019, that included people of faith, but the people of western Sydney have just battled through the Delta outbreak and the prolonged lockdown. Liberals tell me there is residual anger in that part of Sydney because a lot of small businesses failed to qualify for the government\u2019s fiscal support because they were cash businesses. MPs also point to a widely-held perception that there was one rule for the eastern suburbs and another for the west.\nThe Labor frontbencher Ed Husic gave voice to community resentment in a recent speech. He noted 60% of the pandemic deaths happened in the west and south-west of Sydney. People in the west were \u201clocked down, treated like we\u2019re responsible for the Bondi cluster, made to jump through testing and vaccination hoops just to leave our local government areas to make a living\u201d.\n\u201cThe Liberals were content to draw a line through the middle of Sydney, carve it up \u2013 and see how we on the other side fared,\u201d Husic said. \u201cIt was a grossly uneven line at that \u2026 The Liberals bizarrely managed to divide the Penrith LGA, locking down the largely Labor-voting areas and leaving free the largely Liberal-voting ones.\u201d\nThe recent message from Labor has been clear: if you want to weaponise religious freedom against us in migrant communities in Sydney\u2019s west, we can see you and raise you a pandemic walk of shame. MPs think housing affordability, jobs and even climate change \u2013 with the western suburbs now sweltering in extreme heat during the summer \u2013 are more salient issues than religious freedom.\nWith the federal election now only months away, some Liberals are worried about how the government is travelling in New South Wales. There is significant frustration that preselections have not been finalised for key seats. There is also concern about bleeding votes to political insurgencies on the right, with the long pandemic restrictions an accelerant of voter disaffection.\nA lot of the focus this week, understandably, has been on the ugly and deeply troubling civil unrest in Melbourne. But major-party MPs believe Clive Palmer\u2019s United Australia party is also picking up support in NSW, with Craig Kelly now the party\u2019s Sydney-based frontman. If you\u2019ve watched politics this week, you\u2019ll have noticed that both Morrison and Labor leader Anthony Albanese focused their faux campaigns in Sydney and surrounding areas.\nThat brings us back to Morrison, and Daniel Andrews\u2019 accusation about the prime minister dog-whistling to extremists. Premiers have endured death threats, and federal MPs report being besieged by infuriated anti-vaxxers in their electoral offices.\nGiven the thin line between political disaffection, rising extremism and lethal violence we\u2019ve seen in Britain and the United States, a cautious prime minister focused on governing (as opposed to constant campaigning) would be minded to send an unequivocal message about boundaries, and responsible civic behaviour.\nBut Morrison knows the Coalition is at risk of bleeding votes to protest parties \u2013 so he\u2019s executed an abrupt shape-shift. A prime minister who is demonstrably comfortable with intervention across a range of fronts now empathises with frustration, and declares government has to get out of people\u2019s faces.\nI mean, seriously? Scott Morrison? The prime minister who shut the international border. The prime minister who put the economy into hibernation and funnelled out billions in fiscal support. The prime minister who demanded a vaccination mandate for aged care workers. The prime minister who fronted the lockdowns, and read out lists of detailed restrictions about hairdressers, barre classes and density limits. The prime minister who repelled the libertarians within his own ranks by declaring he would save lives and livelihoods.\nHow does all the opportunism and inconsistency help him?\nWe can cut to the chase.\nThe clear message that Morrison\u2019s constant shape-shifting sends voters is Australia\u2019s prime minister is fixated on saving one (political) life in particular.\nHis own.",

        "content": "T20 can continue to add value in Australia if broadcasters understand its limits, writes Greg Chappell in his new book\nThere were mixed reactions to the BBL and mixed views about where exactly T20 should sit in the programming. Some of us who had had experience of some earlier changes to the game, for instance when India fell head over heels for 50-over cricket after the 1983 World Cup, knew that there would inevitably be some cost to the interest in and quality of Test cricket. The logic went that if we, as administrators, denigrated Test cricket with our programming or commercial decisions, we couldn\u2019t expect the general public to retain the love of the long game that we were trying to sell to them.\nThere was duly a level of fear about exactly what the BBL would take away, relative to what it added. Even so, CA had concluded, not unwisely, that too few cricket followers were actively supporting their traditional state teams during the domestic Big Bash that had started in 2005. While the contests between the states are still avidly followed by many, it is a long time since a significant number of those followers had been anything more than passive \u2013 listening to radio, getting online updates and reading reports on a day\u2019s play. New identities, shared across six capital cities with two teams apiece in the biggest centres of Sydney and Melbourne, would offer a fresh start.\nOver the first 10 years of the competition, the record would suggest that this was the right move. Particularly in the smaller markets of Perth, Brisbane, Adelaide and Hobart, populations have latched onto their local team in a much more active way. The dual-club models in Melbourne and Sydney have not been without their problems, but they can also point to a good degree of success on the field and also moments like the biggest single crowd for a domestic game in Australian history, when 80,883 spectators descended on the MCG to watch the Melbourne Stars host the crosstown Renegades on a warm January evening in 2016.\nSomething that should always be made clear is that the advent of the BBL was for reasons both directly and indirectly financial, as opposed to cricket reasons. In direct terms it created the opportunity for more revenue through broadcast rights fees, and indirectly it afforded the chance to grow the game\u2019s audience beyond its traditional base and thus expand the number of \u2018customers\u2019 that cricket served in Australia.\nThe cycle that CA was attempting to break in terms of revenue was the fact that when India tours Australia, the governing body makes a lot more money than any other season, including the Ashes, because of the value of selling the rights to that tour back into India. While CA is a bigger and healthier board than many around the world, it was still in the same boat as all those other nations equally dependent on the extra money flowing from an India tour. But by creating the BBL and lavishing resources upon it in its early years \u2013 a significant proportion of which came from a joint stake in the short-lived T20 Champions League \u2013 was able to sell a purely domestic product to broadcasters for a significant sum of money separate to international rights. That had never been possible before, as even a figure as keen on cricket as Kerry Packer never showed much interest in non-international matches. In one move, the BBL increased the value of domestic broadcast rights and reduced CA\u2019s reliance on rights from an India tour.\nThat reliance had been at the front of many minds on the CA board in 2008 after the \u2018Monkeygate\u2019 saga, where for several days a touring India team might have upped sticks and flown home in the middle of a tour, with the financial ramifications that would have had.\nThe decision to invest so much in the BBL, over the grumbles of the states who had wanted the investment to be balanced by the sale of at least some of the clubs to private owners, has paid off, and it is to CA\u2019s credit that it went down that path. But \u2018paid\u2019 is the operative term; the BBL is a tournament that exists for commercial reasons and so has never been considered in the cricketing terms that might otherwise have influenced much of its shape.\nThere were some scary demographics developing in the mid-2000s even though the national team was the world\u2019s best at the time. \u2018Pale, stale and male\u2019 was the catchphrase, with white males over the age of 40 comprising the vast majority of Test cricket\u2019s audience, while anyone under the age of 40 couldn\u2019t give a hoot about it, even more so if those people were female. Consequently there was a need for new ways to attract spectators and players, in the same way 50-over cricket brought a younger and wider crowd to the game in the 1970s and \u201980s.\nHad we only played Test cricket over the past 40 years, cricket would be a niche game played by so few countries it wouldn\u2019t matter: in India it would probably sit a distant third behind football and hockey. On the flip side, South Asian immigration to Australia has only made the BBL more vibrant, as it attracts lovers of the game who are not automatically drawn to the traditional image of the baggy green cap. India, by its sheer size, is not only a giant on its own terms but it has the capacity to create other cricket nations around the world simply through large-scale migration.\nThe subsequent expansion of the BBL into a full home-and-away competition, occupying more than two months of prime summer real estate, has been about chasing ever more of this and other audiences for broadcasters.\nUltimately, this is the biggest worry I have about T20 cricket in general and the BBL in particular. Ever more expansion of an entertainment product like this runs the growing risk of killing the golden goose through over-saturation. The pressure is there from broadcasters for ever more content during the summer holidays, causing offshoot conversations about growing the number of games or even the number of clubs from the current eight. That in turn creates a danger of over-exposing the flaws in T20 cricket, particularly the fact that by fielding eight teams, it is already stretching the talent resources available in Australia.\nThis is an edited extract from Greg Chappell: Not Out, published by Hardie Grant.",

        "content": "Two bodies\u2019 handling of revelations of racism and sexism could hardly be going worse, and sorry is not going to be enough\nSo, how\u2019s that Ashes phoney war going? Back at the beginning of November the headline problem in English cricket was who would bowl in the death overs now Tymal Mills was injured. Three weeks later, the government is threatening to bring in an independent regulator to oversee the ECB, whose chief executive, Tom Harrison, is fighting to hold on to his job, because England\u2019s most successful county club, which has lost its CEO and chairman and suspended its head coach, has been called institutionally racist, while a slew of current players and commentators have been accused of racist and discriminatory behaviour.\nLess than a week ago Australia were celebrating their first-ever World T20 Trophy. Now they have lost their Test captain, Tim Paine, because of a sexting scandal that happened the last time England were in Australia, in 2017. Paine sent an unsolicited \u201cdick pic\u201d to a female employee of Cricket Tasmania with the caption \u201cfinish me off right now\u201d. Four years later, she has, and now Australia have got a fortnight to find a replacement. Cricket Australia cleared Paine of breaching their code of conduct in an investigation they held at the time, but now it\u2019s finally gone public, have decided that they don\u2019t \u201ccondone his language or behaviour\u201d after all.\nThere are some common themes here, of players who seem oblivious to the impact their behaviour has on their colleagues, who seem to feel free to abuse the power they have over people junior to them, and of bosses who have failed to hold those players to account until they\u2019ve been shamed into doing it.\nThis is the same Cricket Australia who were making great play of their plan to commission two new statues of female cricketers as a demonstration of their \u201ccommitment to challenging ourselves to continue to address gender inequality across our game\u201d even while they were sitting on a report about Paine\u2019s behaviour, the same ECB who had their players dress up in \u201canti-discrimination T-shirts\u201d as a display of their \u201ccollective stance against any form of discrimination in cricket\u201d even while they, and Yorkshire, were dragging their heels following up on Rafiq\u2019s allegations, which had been made the previous year.\nThis is the behaviour of executives whose principles are dictated by public relations, who believe in doing the right thing as an exercise in damage limitation. The ECB were at it again on Friday, putting out a statement following their \u201call-game meeting\u201d that offered a series of platitudes about \u201cmaking cricket more open and inclusive\u201d and \u201censuring effective governance and leadership\u201d, and promises of \u201ca series of tangible commitments to make cricket a sport where everyone feels safe and everyone feels included\u201d. There was absolutely no information on what, exactly, those tangible commitments might be. Apparently they still need to \u201cconsult with their stakeholders\u201d before finalising the details.\nIt\u2019s a bureaucratic word salad, institutional gobbledegook leavened with meaningless poster slogans like \u201cwe stand together against discrimination in all its forms\u201d and \u201cour game must win back your trust\u201d, the language of people who have forgotten how to talk honestly, and who are hopelessly out of touch with basic human emotions at play here.\nOne of the great lessons in all this is that language matters, how one small phrase, even when it\u2019s apparently meant in jest, can cause lasting pain and trauma. This week the ECB\u2019s executives have given us a variation on the same lesson, it\u2019s been one long demonstration of how it is possible to say so much and have no real impact at all.\n\u201cWe are truly sorry,\u201d the statement says. How reassuring to know it\u2019s not one of their insincere apologies. And a sincere apology, Rafiq said in parliament on Tuesday, was \u201call I ever wanted\u201d. How they must wish they had given it to him then, in the plain and straightforward language some of those same Yorkshiremen who have been accused of discriminating against him are supposedly famous for. The lawyers who (you imagine) are vetting their statements seem to be more prolix.\nIn among the blizzard of allegations, accusations, and apologies, Rafiq gave one himself when screenshots began to circulate on social media showing a series of antisemitic messages he had sent 10 years earlier.\nAnd typically, his was a model for everyone else to follow: swift, unmitigated, and humane, it sounded like he had written it himself, rather than had it done on his behalf. Rafiq\u2019s messages didn\u2019t diminish his testimony about the culture of the club. If anything they are more evidence about how commonplace racist language was at Yorkshire while he was playing there.\nIt\u2019s too late for a sorry to suffice now, even if the ECB was capable of giving a good one. It\u2019s been 14 months since Rafiq first described how he had considered suicide because of the institutional racism he\u2019d faced at the club, and sorry is not enough. Not any more. The speed with which this has all unravelled is in inverse proportion to the time in which it\u2019s been building, and all the years of institutional failure to address the problem.\nRafiq was the crack that broke the dam. The ECB says that more than 1,000 people have contacted its inquiry into discrimination in cricket in the last week alone. It has already grown well beyond what they are capable of handling. The ECB can\u2019t even be trusted to run a cricket competition without alienating the vast majority of cricket supporters, and that\u2019s what it is supposed to be good at. The idea that they\u2019re in any way equipped to take on a social, political, and cultural problem of this size is utterly laughable.\nIf there\u2019s one positive in all this, it\u2019s that everyone now has a clear idea of the scale of the problem the sport has been fighting against \u2013 and there are, even at the ECB, lots of good people fighting against it. Australia don\u2019t have that, yet, and there is a clear sense of a wider problem lurking under the surface there, too. But then you don\u2019t have to look too hard, or ask too loud, to find evidence of endemic sexism in English cricket either. The Ashes is three weeks away, and the two countries are slouching towards Brisbane.",

        "content": "The decision to punish South Africa\u2019s director of rugby for his video rant during the Lions tour took far too long\nWhen Rassie Erasmus\u2019s remarkable video came to light during the British & Irish Lions tour of South Africa it was the height of summer in the UK. By the time World Rugby released its long overdue verdict this week, Christmas trees had already gone up and festive music has started playing on the radio. For an organisation that is supposed to be the guardian of the game, such a delay is unsatisfactory.\nTo put into perspective just how crazy it is that it took four months to deliver, consider what would have happened had it been a player in the dock. If a player is deemed to have done something worthy of a disciplinary hearing in a match on a Saturday they would be sanctioned by the middle of the following week.\nErasmus\u2019s video came out shortly after the first Lions Test but World Rugby did not even bring disciplinary action until the second Test had taken place. A match, lest we forget where the first half lasted more than an hour, such was the apparent need of the officials to linger over every decision. Granted, the verdict this week was thorough, it was 80 pages long and included powerful testimony from the first Test referee, Nic Berry, but World Rugby does not help itself by waiting for so long before acting.\nThe punishment handed down, on the face of it, seems to fit the crime. A 10-month ban from matchday activities means Erasmus will have to sit out Wales\u2019s summer tour of South Africa next year as well as the Rugby Championship but I think there is a bit of misdirection with the two-month ban from all rugby activities. Saturday marks the end of South Africa\u2019s season.\nSince the video came to light Erasmus was free to continue the rest of the Lions tour, the Rugby Championship \u2013 albeit he did so remotely \u2013 and the majority of their northern hemisphere tour, missing only one match. Again, to use the player comparison, I\u2019d have probably been delighted to miss one match and a bit of pre-season if there was no trophy on the line and Erasmus has made his views on the matter clear on Twitter, supping on a pint of Guinness.\nIn rugby union we often find ourselves craving consistency. But where is the consistency with Erasmus\u2019s ban? Players are no longer given bans in weeks or months, it\u2019s matches \u2013 because there are occasions where weeks or months can be meaningless. Why wasn\u2019t Erasmus banned for a certain number of matches?\nIn the short term, will South Africa be affected by Erasmus\u2019 absence against England? Given the experience of their playing group I\u2019d be surprised. I can\u2019t speak for what works for the Springboks but I know as a player there was a time when you wanted the messaging from the coaches to stop. To have the freedom and responsibility to figure things out on the field.\nI don\u2019t think it will affect Saturday\u2019s match officials either but it may have a galvanising effect on the Springboks. There may be an extra point of motivation there, on top of the fact that they were snubbed for the World Rugby player and coach of the year awards. I wonder if Eddie Jones has recognised that and sought to create the narrative around South Africa claiming England were weak in the World Cup final.\nIt actually reminds me of the buildup to that final and the importance of what is said and how it can motivate players. Having spoken to Siya Kolisi not long afterwards, I know that the hype around Tom Curry and Sam Underhill, particularly after their performance in the semi\u2011final against New Zealand, was a huge motivating factor for him. I remember John Mitchell talking about those two as being on a par with David Pocock, with Richie McCaw, and I think that lit a fire under Kolisi.\nI remember when I played against Scotland for England and all week Thom Evans was being talked about as the fastest winger in Europe. That really pissed me off and I knew that I couldn\u2019t let him score in that match. I remember he made a break, I made a covering tackle \u2013 I\u2019m not sure where I found the speed to get there but I think my extra motivation played a big part.\nUltimately it is the messages in the dressing room that matter most for the players but that doesn\u2019t mean that those made in public cannot make a difference. In many ways, it was what Erasmus was trying to do during the Lions tour \u2013 but clearly he wildly overstepped the mark in doing so \u2013 and I suspect it is what Jones has attempted to do before Saturday\u2019s forwards battle.",

        "content": "Marvin Bartley, Tommy Elphick and Ryan Garry give an insight of what Newcastle players and fans can expect of the manager\nWhen Eddie Howe said on Friday, almost two weeks into the job, that he is yet to see Newcastle in daylight such is the time he has spent at the club\u2019s training ground, it offered a glimpse into the world of a workaholic manager who was in the building before 7am on his first day.\n\u201cWhen he takes a job on, he is fully invested,\u201d says Marvin Bartley, who played under Howe at Bournemouth and Burnley. \u201cOne day I thought: \u2018I\u2019m going to beat the gaffer in.\u2019 No matter what time I came in in the morning, his car would be there. I\u2019m thinking: \u2018How is he getting in so early? Is he sleeping there?\u2019 I was never able to beat him in.\u201d\nThere is no chance Howe\u2019s team will be underprepared for Brentford\u2019s visit to St James\u2019 Park on Saturday, even though he has to miss his first game after testing positive for Covid-19. Howe will be in contact with his staff from his hotel room and his assistants, Jason Tindall and Graeme Jones, will lead the team. \u201cHe always thought the training would take care of the weekend,\u201d says Tommy Elphick, his captain when Bournemouth won promotion to the Premier League. \u201cAs a player, you could always see he was working backwards.\u201d\nHowe has spoken of feeling refreshed and energised on his return to management after 15 months away, but in that time, as well as enjoying playing sport with his eldest sons, Rocky and Harry, he focused on self-improvement, visiting Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, Rayo Vallecano and Liverpool, optimising his colour-coded training plans into a digital format and analysing Newcastle\u2019s strengths and weaknesses long before taking the job.\n\u201cPeople would say: \u2018You\u2019ve been out of the game\u2019 and question that, but for me I\u2019m more relevant and in touch than I\u2019ve ever been in terms of what is going on at the top level,\u201d Howe said last week.\nDay one provided a snapshot of how Howe works. First came the bleep test \u2013 high fitness levels are paramount for his teams to be dynamic \u2013 and on the grass he was typically hands-on, playing out a passing drill focused on overlapping runs. \u201cHis energy in training is what drove us,\u201d Elphick says. \u201cHe taught us a way to win. We all got a text message the night before his first session. He asked us to bring some money in to put into a pot. He split us into four teams and we had a winner-takes-all tournament. It was a way he tapped into us to bring a competitive edge to the group. We never looked back.\u201d\nThose who have worked with Howe stress how much he cares about his players and staff. He was there for Harry Arter after the tragic death of the midfielder\u2019s daughter, and Ryan Garry, who played under Howe during the manager\u2019s first spell at Bournemouth, recalls his support after breaking his leg for a second time. \u201cEddie was first-team coach at the time and he was one of the first staff members, after the physio, to give me a call,\u201d says Garry, the England Under-18s manager. \u201cHe has got that empathy for people on a personal level. Those little things you don\u2019t forget.\u201d\nHe would often lay on \u201cextras\u201d at training. Garry remembers Howe and his assistant Jason Tindall putting on a 45-minute session for defenders \u2013 \u201cEddie\u2019s appetite for developing players is huge\u201d \u2013 and when Bartley joined Burnley from Bournemouth, he and Charlie Austin would head in early because Howe would put on tailor-made sessions. Garry raises another episode after a League Two defeat at Aldershot. \u201cI was marking their striker, Marvin Morgan, and myself and Eddie had a difference of opinion. We got back to the ground, everyone\u2019s gone home, the lights are out, and we\u2019re having a half-hour discussion in the tunnel about how you can mark someone in the channel.\u201d\nWhen Howe, formerly Bournemouth\u2019s centre of excellence manager, took the reins in 2008, the team were lumbered with a 17-point deduction, bailiffs turned up on a regular basis and players went unpaid. Howe galvanised the club, washing the kit and dipping into his own pocket to fund equipment and bring in a conditioning coach. He and Tindall would scout the opposition. \u201cI would know everything about my opponent before I went on the pitch,\u201d says Bartley. \u201cEddie was ahead of his time.\u201d\nHowe was quick to foster a sense of buy-in. After avoiding relegation to non-league, he told the squad on the first day of pre-season that the aim was promotion, which they achieved. \u201cHe makes you believe in yourself and in him,\u201d says Bartley, recalling Howe\u2019s first spell at Bournemouth. \u201cWe were almost like robots; we believed in him so much, we respected him so much. Anything that he said went. If he said you have to run 10 miles before you train, we would do it without question. When he went to Burnley, they had just been relegated and there were a lot of players that thought they knew better.\u201d\nHowe demands high standards. Sitting on balls in training is punished with a fine and players recognised they could not ease off. \u201cIt was always: \u2018How are we going to get better for tomorrow?\u2019\u201d says Elphick. \u201cWhen he walks into the canteen, you would always sit up that little bit straighter. On away trips I would always make sure I was down and looking fresh and ready for breakfast. You were always conscious what he was thinking about you. He definitely carries that presence and aura and keeps you on your toes.\u201d\nThe 43-year-old seems permanently fresh-faced and although he is personable, he is not merely a Mr Nice Guy. Howe sent Aaron Ramsdale, an \u00a3800,000 signing from Sheffield United, on loan after the goalkeeper missed the bus for a Bournemouth game at Chelsea. \u201cIf he needs to rollick you, he will, but he loses it in the right way, to make sure it has an impact on the team,\u201d says Bartley, recalling the time he snaked down the team bus carrying a cowboy costume for the Christmas party in Manchester, a couple of hours after being sent off early in a 5-0 defeat at Morecambe.\n\u201cIt was one of those old-school coaches that only had one way on, one way off, so to get off we had to walk past the gaffer. I had the hat and everything, boots with the spikes \u2013 they were clinking along as I was walking down the coach. I was saying to Darren Anderton: \u2018I can\u2019t come.\u2019 As I went past him he didn\u2019t even look at me. I could just feel he was disgusted with me. He brought it up in every team talk after, saying: \u2018You boys owe me.\u2019\u201d",

        "content": "Thomas Tuchel believes Conor Gallagher is in the right place to continue his rapid development after the midfielder\u2019s excellent performances on loan at Crystal Palace were rewarded with a senior England debut.\nGallagher performed well as a substitute for Gareth Southgate\u2019s side against San Marino having been called up as a replacement for Chelsea\u2019s Mason Mount after playing for England Under 21s against the Czech Republic last week. The 21-year-old spent last season on loan at West Brom and Tuchel said said he was delighted with the progress Gallagher has made under Patrick Vieira at Palace.\nAsked whether he had considered recalling Gallagher, the Chelsea manager said: \u201cActually I haven\u2019t thought about it. I think it is important for him to be happy where he is and not change things. It is important to be calm, I feel him happy there and that he is having this impact at Crystal Palace.\u201d\nTuchel was more circumspect about Gallagher\u2019s chances of breaking through at Chelsea next season but the player has clearly made an impression.\n\u201cIt is too early to talk about that in public before we talk with Conor himself and what his goals are,\u201d Tuchel said. \u201cThis will happen in the summer as we all agreed to the decision that we wanted to send him to Palace. He saw a possibility for him. I am not surprised the national coach loves him because I loved him from day one. Humble, nice, smile on his face and all the time ready to give everything, want to learn and improve.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cAs a teammate I would have loved to play with him. It is a pleasure to know him; I am super happy that it has worked out so well. He needs to keep his feet on the ground.\u201d\nChelsea are hopeful that Romelu Lukaku may be fit for a place on the bench at home to Juventus in the Champions League on Tuesday, and continue to be without Mateo Kovacic for the trip to Leicester on Saturday lunchtime. Tuchel was positive over new contracts for the defenders Antonio R\u00fcdiger and Andreas Christensen, whose deals expire at the end of the season.\n\u201cThings are mature, respectful and clear,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course there are delays. With Andreas too, from my point of view, we all want the same thing. Hopefully and obviously I expect some good news in the next days but everything can change. The situations are handled from all sides very carefully.\u201d\n Tuchel dismissed reports that Hakim Ziyech, who has started only two league games this season, could be allowed to leave in January.\n\u201cAt the moment there are no thoughts about a potential change, swap deal or whatever,\u201d he said. \u201cI have talked to nobody here in Cobham about that. Hakim was not in my office expressing a wish like this and right now I think he is a full and important member of the squad.\n\u201cHe is a very talented guy and a very ambitious guy. We expect the very best of him all the time but it\u2019s very tough competition. I cannot let everybody play 90 minutes all the time. It\u2019s simply impossible.\u201d",

        "content": "The turkeys, raised in Jasper, Indiana, were pardoned by the president on the day House passed his Build Back Better agenda\nIt has been described as the hardest job in the world. American presidents are expected to be tough but compassionate, dealing with a never-ending list of crises and, once a year, playing standup comic with a pair of turkeys.\nThe collision was acute and awkward for Joe Biden on Friday after a jury acquitted Kyle Rittenhouse of all charges related to deadly shootings last year at an anti-racism protest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, sparking widespread outrage.\nOften touted for his empathy, Biden issued a statement acknowledging that the verdict \u201cwill leave many Americans feeling angry and concerned, myself included\u201d. But minutes later, in a screeching gear shift, he was in the White House Rose Garden pardoning two Thanksgiving turkeys.\nOn a bright, cold day, with a whiff of hot apple cider in the air, he made the best of it.\nThe annual ritual \u201creminds us to have a little bit of fun and always be grateful\u201d, said Biden, adding later: \u201cIt\u2019s important to continue traditions like this, to remind us how from darkness there is light and hope and progress, and that\u2019s what this year\u2019s Thanksgiving, in my view, represents.\u201d\nSomeone with a dark sense of humor might have named the turkeys Manchin and Sinema, after the two Democrats standing in the way of Biden\u2019s agenda in the US Senate. Instead the birds, raised in Jasper, Indiana, were called Peanut Butter and Jelly, which met with presidential approval.\n\u201cI have to admit to you \u2013 my wife doesn\u2019t like me to admit it \u2013 that\u2019s what I like for lunch: peanut butter and jelly,\u201d Biden said.\nThe annual White House ceremony to spare a turkey from the Thanksgiving dinner table began in earnest with George HW Bush in 1989. Donald Trump trashed many traditions but maintained this one, trying his hand at political satire despite the scandals engulfing him.\nBarack Obama used to make his daughters wince with turkey wordplay such as \u201cYes, we cran\u201d. Puns were one more norm restored to the White House by Biden.\nPeanut Butter and Jelly, he said, had been selected \u201cbased on their temperament, appearance and, I suspect, vaccination status \u2013 yes, instead of getting basted, these two turkeys are getting boosted\u201d \u2013 a nod to vaccine booster shots that the Food and Drug Administration authorized broader use of earlier in the day.\nThe turkeys, on the move to Biden\u2019s right, made gobbling noises.\nThe turkeys had received red carpet treatment at a fancy Washington hotel, prompting a gag at the expense of the transportation secretary, Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, and his husband Chasten.\n\u201cSecretary Buttigieg couldn\u2019t be here today. But I\u2019m sorry for Pete and Chasten, Peanut Butter and Jelly are now the new Indiana power couple.\u201d\nAll this prompted polite ripples of laughter from White House staff and their children. Biden had more. This was a blockbuster day that had begun with the House of Representatives passing his Build Back Better package.\n\u201cFolks, turkey is infrastructure. Peanut Butter and Jelly are going to help build back the Butterball.\u201d\nAs is also traditional, the president, who underwent a colonoscopy on Friday and turns 79 on Saturday, turned serious for a bit, dwelling on those who have lost loved ones, the unfinished struggle against the coronavirus pandemic and the need to heal the nation\u2019s divisions.\nThen came the grand finale, as he walked over to Peanut Butter, raised his hand and declared: \u201cBy the power vested in me as president of the United States, I pardon you, I pardon you this Thanksgiving.\u201d\nPeanut Butter gobbled. Biden leaned down and stroked Jelly. Both birds are destined to live out their days at Purdue University in Indiana.\n\u201cThank you everybody, hope you have a happy, happy, happy Thanksgiving,\u201d Biden said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s freezing, innit?\u201d\nAs the band played, Biden worked the crowd and posed for pictures with children, the avuncular retail politician once more, savouring this lighthearted interlude. Perhaps he could be forgiven for not hurrying back to the Oval Office and its world of trouble.",

        "content": "Former Daily Mail editor announces decision not to proceed with second bid and takes swipe at civil service\nPaul Dacre has pulled out of the running to be the next chair of the media regulator, Ofcom, after concerns were raised about the transparency of the recruitment process.\nAfter failing in his first attempt when an interview panel decided the former editor of the Daily Mail did not fulfil the required criteria, ministers then cleared the way for him to be given another shot.\nBut when the Guardian revealed a lobbyist at a company with close connections to the Conservative party was picked to help select which candidates should be approved, Dacre announced he would not proceed with an application again despite being urged to \u201cby many senior members of the government\u201d.\nHe said he had been judged inappropriate to head Ofcom the first time because his \u201cstrong convictions\u201d were not compatible with the role.\nOne government figure told the Guardian they were \u201cgenuinely disappointed\u201d by Dacre\u2019s decision to pull out and ministers had expected to back him to become chair of Ofcom. They insisted the former Daily Mail editor had taken the decision not to proceed after not enjoying the original interview process and reflecting on how it could be second time around. The growing public scrutiny of appointments and government sleaze following the Owen Paterson affair may have also played a role, although the source insisted ministers did not tell Dacre to step aside.\nThe government had spent more than a year trying to ease Dacre\u2019s application for the job. After he failed the first interview process the government spent the summer trying to find people willing to sit on a fresh interview panel for the job, with many individuals reluctant to put their name to the process. The job description was also rewritten to favour a more confrontational candidate, in another move seen as favouring Dacre.\nThe government now has just 10 days to find another preferred candidate, with applications due by 29 November.\nAnnouncing his decision to drop out of the Ofcom race, Dacre described the process of civil service recruitment as an \u201cinfelicitous dalliance with the blob\u201d, and suggested it was Whitehall workers rather than politicians \u201cwho really run this country\u201d.\nWriting in a letter in the Times, he said: \u201cTo anyone from the private sector, who, God forbid, has convictions, and is thinking of applying for a public appointment, I say the following: the civil service will control (and leak) everything; the process could take a year in which your life will be put on hold; and if you are possessed of an independent mind and are unassociated with the liberal/left, you will have more chance of winning the lottery than getting the job.\u201d\nDacre said he wished Ofcom \u201call the luck in the world\u201d as it prepared to grapple with \u201ctrying to regulate the omnipotent, ruthless and, as we\u2019ve learnt, amoral tech giants without damaging freedom of expression\u201d.\nIn a final attack on the civil service, Dacre said he was taking up \u201can exciting new job\u201d in the private sector that \u201cstruggles to create the wealth to pay for all those senior civil servants working from home so they can spend more time exercising on their Peloton bikes and polishing their political correctness\u201d.\nFollowing the suspicion that senior politicians had interfered in an attempt to install Dacre despite his apparent unsuitability for the role, Boris Johnson was urged to rule him out of the running.\nThe Conservative MP Julian Knight, the chair of the culture select committee, said earlier this autumn: \u201cWhere a previous candidate has been deemed to be unappointable for a post, they should be ruled out of reapplying.\u201d\nA spokesperson for Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said: \u201cThe recruitment process is fair and open and in line with the governance code for public appointments, which clearly sets out that assessment panels must be objective when deciding which candidates meet the criteria for a role.\n\u201cThe process is regulated by the Commissioner for Public Appointments, who is responsible for ensuring that the appointment is made in accordance with strict guidelines.\u201d\nIt came as the Scottish and Welsh governments raised concerns about interference in the recruitment of Ofcom\u2019s next chair, saying it could \u201cadversely affect the standing of the public service broadcasting system\u201d.\nIn a letter to the culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, ministers for both the devolved administrations said \u201cdelays, changes and an apparent lack of transparency have caused us to lose further confidence in the process\u201d.\nThey questioned the level of Downing Street\u2019s interference, saying the appointment process had been \u201ctarnished by delays and questions about the real independence of those involved\u201d.\nAccusing Dorries and her predecessor as culture secretary Oliver Dowden of overseeing a selection that was \u201cfalling below the standards we expect\u201d, the Welsh and Scottish government demanded to be brought in on the process.\nThey wrote: \u201cGiven the importance of public service broadcasting to our nations and the real impact for our nations of any decision on selecting the Ofcom chair which is not transparent or impartial, we urge you to involve us fully in the process as is right to protect a system which is so important to the public in Scotland and Wales and all the UK.\u201d",

As he heads to his country retreat of Chequers this weekend, some at Westminster have begun to wonder if he has what it takes to get the show back on the road.\nAs well as exposing Johnson\u2019s lax approach to probity in public life, the Paterson debacle highlighted what those who have worked with him say is one of his most maddening characteristics \u2013 the impetuous style of decision-making and tendency to sudden reversals cruelly caricatured by Dominic Cummings as \u201clike a shopping trolley\u201d.\nAnd it played into wider worries about his competence and whether the Downing Street machine is working as it should. \u201cNo 10 is a really difficult job and he doesn\u2019t have the skillset to run it, he just doesn\u2019t,\u201d said one senior Tory. \u201cHe\u2019s a great campaigner; a terrible administrator. But he doesn\u2019t trust anyone to run it for him.\u201d\nJohnson\u2019s longtime adviser Ben \u201cGazza\u201d Gascoigne was recently persuaded to return to his side, in a sign that all was not well with the post-Cummings setup.\nOne Conservative MP likened the impact of the events of the past fortnight to a hurricane hitting the government. \u201cObviously morale is low, and people have felt dispirited,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s completely up to him to turn it around.\u201d\nYet Tory MPs\u2019 perceptions of Johnson are inevitably heavily influenced by his ability to help them try to hold their seats at the next general election, and so far there is only modest evidence that the negative headlines are damaging the Conservatives\u2019 appeal.\n\u201cPeople have noticed it, and it has added to this general sense that was already there, of a slight loss in confidence in the government compared to the giddy heights of the vaccine rollout,\u201d said James Johnson, a pollster with JL Partners who previously worked for Theresa May. \u201cWhat I don\u2019t think it is, is the definitive brand-changing moment for Boris Johnson.\u201d\nHe said the prime minister remained protected by the \u201creputational screen\u201d of the pandemic, and the sentiment of many voters in recent focus groups he had carried out continued to be that \u201cthey\u2019re in an unprecedented situation, they\u2019re doing their best job\u201d.\nIt is unclear how long that screen will continue to deflect voters\u2019 concerns about other issues.\nProf Rob Ford, an elections expert at Manchester University, likened the impact of sleaze stories on a government\u2019s popularity to the children\u2019s game Jenga. \u201cYou\u2019re watching Johnson pull Jenga blocks out from the bottom and put them on the top. You can see that the pile is becoming more unstable, but you can never really know for sure whether any particular block that you pull out is going to be the one that pulls the whole thing down.\u201d\nRemembering the mid-1990s, when John Major\u2019s government was dogged by a slew of sleaze stories, he said: \u201cOnce it sets in as an atmosphere, as a miasma, and once voters begin to expect it, then there\u2019s an air of self-fulfilling prophecy to it.\u201d\nLabour strategists have long believed that by highlighting alleged corruption \u2013 whether the prime minister\u2019s wallpaper or the Covid contracts VIP lane \u2013 they can chip away at Johnson\u2019s reputation, but they wouldn\u2019t have dared hope for the self-inflicted damage of the past fortnight.\n\u201cIt\u2019s brought out the best in lots of people in the party, not least Keir [Starmer] and Angela [Rayner],\u201d said one Labour insider, referring to the party leader and his deputy. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a gift to us, the fact that Keir is strait-laced, and with his career history \u2013 he doesn\u2019t exactly scream corruption. And it also plays into Angela\u2019s strengths as someone who can really tear chunks out of them. It creates a really nice dynamic for us.\u201d\nLabour is under no illusions that this alone will help it to dislodge Johnson, but it believes the cracks are starting to show on domestic policy delivery too, particularly against the backdrop of a deteriorating economic environment.\nTwo announcements at the end of the week made clear that delivering on Johnson\u2019s promise to \u201cunleash Britain\u2019s potential\u201d in a way his voters will appreciate will not be straightforward. The cap on costs for social care and plans for new rail links across the north of England have been significantly scaled back \u2013 with red wall voters set to benefit less than had been previously expected.\nThe changes have been driven by cost-cutting, with Rishi Sunak keen for the Conservatives to avoid clobbering the middle classes with more tax increases and to hold on to their reputation as guardians of the public purse, something he sees as a key dividing line with Labour.\nBut Sunak\u2019s cautious approach underlines the tensions between the disparate groups of voters who handed Johnson his majority in 2019 \u2013 the red wall of newly Tory seats, and the blue wall across the home counties, now firmly in the Liberal Democrats\u2019 sights after their victory in Chesham and Amersham.\n\u201cThe two halves of the Conservative coalition, the only thing they agree on is \u2018get Brexit done\u2019,\u201d said Ford. \u201cAny policy that actually falls under the category \u2018unleash Britain\u2019s potential\u2019 involves one half of that coalition paying for something the other half wants, or one half of that coalition getting it in the neck for something the other half doesn\u2019t want.\u201d\nHe pointed to planning proposals \u2013 now under review by Michael Gove \u2013 that would have led to significant increases in housebuilding in the south, and the changes to the social care plans.\nHanding Gove the levelling up portfolio in the latest reshuffle was an indication that Downing Street takes seriously these issues of how, where and at whose cost its promises can be delivered. But there are inherent tensions, and they are evident not just within the Tories\u2019 voter base but in the parliamentary party too.\nAnother of Johnson\u2019s character traits was highlighted by the backlash against the scaled-back rail plans \u2013 namely, his boosterish tendency to make lavish promises he then fails to deliver.\nThe transport select committee chair, Huw Merriman, put it most brutally in the Commons, saying: \u201cThis is the danger in selling perpetual sunlight and then leaving it for others to explain the arrival of moonlight.\u201d But it was striking how many other Conservative MPs expressed their anger publicly. Many more did so in private.\nDowning Street hopes Johnson has now wrenched the car back on to the road after a torrid few weeks, but he can\u2019t expect much gratitude from his shaken colleagues. As Ford put it: \u201cI can\u2019t think of a story when there\u2019s been so much harm wilfully inflicted by a government on itself.\u201d",

        "content": "John Lewis, Asda and Currys plan more deals but some retailers report stock and staff shortages\nThe Black Friday discount day is back with a bang this year with shoppers expected to spend almost \u00a39.2bn next weekend \u2013 15% more than in 2020 when much of the UK\u2019s high street was in lockdown.\nJohn Lewis, Asda and Currys said they were planning more deals this year for the event, which accounts for more sales than Christmas week, despite struggles with sourcing stock and recruiting drivers for home deliveries.\nSome stores, such as Next and Marks & Spencer, do not take part in Black Friday and others are taking a different approach. Ikea, for example, is offering 20% extra in refunds on old furniture items brought back for resale.\nGary Grant, the founder and chairman of toy chain The Entertainer, said consumer confidence had been knocked by rising living costs such as higher food and fuel bills and shoppers would be eager to save money in the Black Friday sales.\n\u201cThe consumer wants Black Friday deals,\u201d he said.\nWhile experts agree that Black Friday sales will rise, as families prepare to gather after the pandemic put a dampener on celebrations last year, there is debate over how well high street stores will fare in comparison to online.\nOnline spending is expected to rise by a fifth compared with last year, according to research by analysts at GlobalData for the VoucherCodes Shopping for Christmas report, despite the reopening of high street outlets.\nHowever, Andy Mulcahy, the strategy and insight director at the online retail trade body IMRG, thinks web sales for November, and Black Friday itself, could be down as much as 10% now shoppers have the option to go in to stores.\nThis would be the first time less money was spent online on Black Friday than the year before in the UK since the event was first imported from the US a decade ago.\nConcerns about online players\u2019 ability to deliver goods and shortages of some ppular products, such as computers and gaming consoles, may also dampen spending.\nMulcahy said retailers were still upbeat, and for those with good stock holdings Black Friday would be a \u201cbanger\u201d.\n\u201cThey [sales] will be very high still, it\u2019s just that those volumes are rationalising a bit following astronomical growth in 2020,\u201d he added.\nIn the battle for shoppers rival stores have engaged in one-upmanship by launching deals well before Black Friday. Amazon, for example, started its sale nearly a fortnight ago, Currys launched deals for its loyalty card holders on 5 November and John Lewis launched its first 900 offers on Friday. Of the 317 retailers IMRG monitors about a quarter had launched their Black Friday promotions by Friday, a similar number to last year.\nJon Williams, the trading operations director at John Lewis, said the retailer was expecting a return to 2019 levels. He said sales were already ramping up by 40% week on week as shoppers prepared for Christmas. The department store plans to have 17% more offers than last year when stores were closed and a special \u201ccrisis group\u201d will meet every day up to Christmas to head off problems with deliveries or stock supply.\nWilliams said that despite a shortage of drivers across the industry the company was confident of being able to meet demand for home deliveries as they expected more sales in stores.\n\u201cWe expect about 70% of sales online and 30% in stores so that amount going through the shops should take the pressure off,\u201d he said.\nHe expects strong demand for technology products and said John Lewis had worked hard to get enough computers in stock given the global shortage of microchips that had put the squeeze on availability across the industry. Williams said there would be \u201cpockets were some suppliers of big brands are stressed\u201d.\nGrant said the pandemic had \u201ctrained\u201d people to shop online, a trend that had been to the detriment of high streets and shopping centres. To coax shoppers out, The Entertainer will offer an additional 10% off to customers who spend more than \u00a330 in its stores next week.\nIn what is likely to be a widespread problem, The Entertainer was experiencing problems with agency staff not turning up for shifts in its warehouses \u2013 even though it is offering retention bonuses for workers who stay on until Christmas.\n\u201cIn the first three days of this week we have had 86 people not turn up for work and that has a huge impact on your productivity,\u201d Grant said. \u201cIf we can\u2019t pick it, we can\u2019t get it on a lorry and the shop can\u2019t have their stock delivery.\u201d\nTV: LG 55NANO806PA \u2013 was \u00a3899, now \u00a3599 (a third off) at AO, John Lewis or Very.Laptops: Apple MacBook Pro 13-inch 2020 (Core i5) \u2013 was \u00a31,999, now \u00a31,799 (10% off) at John Lewis; Samsung Galaxy Book Pro 13.3-inch \u2013 was \u00a31,099, now \u00a3949 (about 13% off) at Currys or AO.\nWashing machine: LG F6V1010WTSE \u2013 was \u00a3949, now \u00a3749 (21% off) at AO or John Lewis.Electric toothbrush: Oral B Smart 5 5000 \u2013 was \u00a3169.99, now \u00a364.99 from Amazon (62% off according to the retailer).",

        "content": "Okehampton welcomes revamp of service connecting Dartmoor town to Exeter and beyond\nIn 1972, the people of Okehampton turned out in force to wish a fond farewell to the Devon moorland town\u2019s regular passenger rail service.\nThe mayor, Walter John Passmore, carried a funeral wreath and his wife, Daisy, waved the green flag to signal the final train\u2019s departure, just about managing a sad smile for the cameras.\nAlmost half a century on, the Dartmoor line is being reopened, and the first 40-minute service was due to arrive in Okehampton from Exeter St David\u2019s shortly after first light on Saturday.\n\u201cIt\u2019s great news for the town and for the whole area,\u201d said Dennis Le Worthy, a retired police officer, who was among the lucky ones treated to a trial trip on the revamped branch line this week.\n\u201cThe town has been crying out for this. It will bring more visitors in and make it easier for Okehampton people to get into Exeter for work, college, shopping, the hospital whatever.\u201d He disembarked the trial train beaming. \u201cIt was exceedingly smooth.\u201d\nWhile there is gnashing of teeth in northern England at Boris Johnson\u2019s announcement that major rail projects have been shelved, there was at least some train joy in west Devon.\nOkehampton businesses reckon it will be a financial boost for the town. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be amazing,\u201d said Paul Elston, who manages the youth hostel and bike hire store next to the station. He is anticipating carriages full of cyclists and hikers heading to Okehampton and the moor.\nThe estate agents are seeing an increase in interest in the town. Miller Town & Country has a sign in its window announcing: \u201cHome buyers from Exeter are coming.\u201d Sales negotiator Helena Thomas said people would be able to buy in Okehampton and commute far and wide \u2013 even as far as London. \u201cWe\u2019re selling everything as soon as it comes on the market,\u201d she said.\nKevin Ball, a borough councillor, said it was not just about people making a fast buck. \u201cWhen the railway first came here 150 years ago it helped tackle rural isolation,\u201d he said. \u201cThe closure of the line brought that back. This new train service will make people feel more connected.\u201d\nAndrea Davis, Devon county council\u2019s cabinet member for climate change, environment and transport, hopes more people would leave their cars at home and use the branch line to reach Dartmoor. \u201cIt\u2019s giving people greener choices,\u201d she said. And it will also, hopefully, ease pressure on the A30, the main route into Devon and Cornwall.\nAlthough the line was closed as part of the Beeching cuts, the track was not ripped up. Volunteers helped run a heritage service on the line, including children\u2019s Christmas specials, and since the late 90s the county council has subsidised limited Sunday Great Western Railway services between Okehampton and Exeter.\nEarlier this year the Dartmoor line was awarded \u00a340m through the Department for Transport\u2019s Restoring Your Railway Fund. The project to reopen the line took just nine months and came in under budget.\nNetwork Rail praised its engineers who had worked so quickly but also emphasised it had been an effort by the whole community, who had worked alongside professionals, doing jobs ranging from helping hack back vegetation at the side of the line to sprucing up the station.\nAmong the volunteers were wife and husband Sue and Tom Baxter, stalwarts of the Dartmoor Railway Association, which has campaigned for the return of the Dartmoor line.\n\u201cIt\u2019s wonderful to see the trains back,\u201d said Sue, who was to be found fussing over bunting on the station before the reopening and is about to go on a GWR customer services course so she can work as a volunteer station helper.\nNetwork Rail and its partners say that if the Dartmoor Line is well used, it will help build the case that other closed branch routes should be reopened. Many would like a rail line to the town of Tavistock and then on to Plymouth restored.\nBut the glory days of rail travel when you could whizz from London to the resorts of north Cornwall are still far away.\nMalcolm and Amanda Mitchell, from Bude in north Cornwall, had made the winding 30-mile road journey to reach Okehampton to view the last-minute preparations.\nThey are supporters of the pressure group Connect Bude, which is campaigning to bring the line back to their town. \u201cWe\u2019ve still some way to go before we get our route back,\u201d said Malcolm. \u201cThis is great for Okehampton but we may not see our line in our lifetime, which is a sad thought.\u201d",

But it\u2019s also the place to pick up organic fruit and vegetables produced on surrounding farms, surprising Flemish cheeses, many, such as Westmalle, aged with a local Abbey-brewed beer, freshly caught shrimp, and tasty maatjes soused herrings.\nOn the square you can also discover local wines at Belgian Wine Bar (their Entre-deux-Monts bubbly is excellent), vegan ice-creams at Icelab, or delicious cheese and shrimp croquettes sold in the unmissable Faro, a red-and-white-striped street-food lighthouse.\nDinnerInvincible may be closed on Saturday and Sunday but weekend visitrs can still kick off in style by reserving a Friday-night slot at this local favourite. A three-course meal comprises creative dishes mixing classic Flemish ingredients, such as saut\u00e9ed crunchy brussels sprouts with intense bone marrow, or pairing flaky line-fished hake with the salty sea vegetable salicorne.

Whether you go for pintxos (tapas) in the bar or a proper meal in the restaurant upstairs, you\u2019ll want to return. It\u2019s all about the best local produce \u2013 off the scale in this part of Spain \u2013 prepared in seemingly simple yet ingenious ways by chef Pablo Loureiro Rodil.

Gros, just across the river, is another foodie paradise, particularly for cool, contemporary places to eat. At Galerna Jan Edan, Jorge Asenjo and Rebeka Barainka are only just in their 30s but already have a lot of fans in gourmet circles in Spain. Working with small local producers, they create intriguing menus that always feature oysters.

Superb local produce (meat and cheese as well as seafood), spectacular beaches and a dynamic cultural scene make the Cantabrian capital a clever choice for a city break.\nLunch\n  It may look like a bright-and-breezy gastrobar but Vermuter\u00eda Sol\u00f3rzano was actually founded 80 years ago and is a Santander institution. Ask the barman to recommend a vermouth (from a list of more than 100) to sip while you have a look at the menu, then pick a few things to share to get a flavour of the traditional dishes of northern Spain. Rabas \u2013 strips of super fresh squid in batter \u2013 are the quintessential tapa here, so start with those.

One of its specialities is hake, maybe in tempura batter with a mild allioli sauce, or with salsa verde and clams. There are superb steaks and the oxtail with lamb sweetbreads is also popular. And its rice pudding and homemade ice-cream with li\u00e9bana cheese make dessert a memorable part of the meal.

        "content": "Ex-head of Renault and Nissan insists colleague held in Japan is innocent as he works to refute his own charges\nCarlos Ghosn knows how compelling his story is. Born in Brazil to Lebanese parents, he scaled the corporate ladder to the very top of global industry to be crowned head of Renault and Nissan, before suffering a spectacular downfall: arrested in Japan and, in a dramatic finale, escaping in a box to freedom in Beirut.\n\u201cThere are going to be a lot of movies,\u201d he said via video interview just before the third anniversary of his arrest. \u201cThis story is very rich. There are so many facets.\u201d\nGhosn has already given extensive access to one documentary, with versions from Apple TV+ and Netflix in the works. He is also to be played by Fran\u00e7ois Cluzet, a French cinema legend and star of international hit The Intouchables, in an unauthorised television series, and is working directly with another miniseries about the events.\nBefore his arrest in 2018 on charges of concealing income, Ghosn ran a car manufacturing behemoth second only to Volkswagen in volume. His empire included France\u2019s Renault and Japan\u2019s Nissan, and he had masterminded a carmaking alliance that also took in Mitsubishi. He is now living the life of a free man with his wife in Lebanon (which does not have an extradition treaty with Japan) and still working on refuting the Japanese charges, as well as doing consulting work via video calls.\nGhosn\u2019s freedom has come at great cost to other people. An American former special forces soldier and his son were jailed in Japan for their part in helping Ghosn escape, as were two pilots and an airport official in Turkey, where the plane stopped en route to Lebanon.\nGhosn has also been unable to testify in the months-long trial of Greg Kelly, an American former Nissan executive arrested at the same time as him whose movements have been limited to Japan since November 2018. The judges in Kelly\u2019s case have given themselves until March to reach a verdict. Kelly denies the charge of helping Ghosn conceal income.\nWhile the judges deliberate, and three years after the initial arrests, Ghosn\u2019s public relations advisers contacted the Guardian to offer separate interviews with him and Kelly\u2019s wife of 43 years, in which both protested Kelly\u2019s innocence and criticised the slow-moving Japanese criminal justice system.\nDee Kelly has had to start a Japanese language course in order to qualify for a student visa, which allows her to stay in Japan with her husband. She watched all but one day out of 71 of Kelly\u2019s extended trial.\n\u201cYour life is taken from you,\u201d she said, speaking via video from Washington, where she was lobbying senators after the end of her husband\u2019s trial. \u201cIt\u2019s thrown out the window.\u201d\nShe said she did not blame Ghosn for fleeing Japan. \u201cHe had to make the decision that was right for him, right for his family,\u201d she said.\nAsked if he felt he shared any blame for the suffering of others, Ghosn said Japan\u2019s \u201chostage justice system\u201d was at fault.\n\u201cYes, I feel bad about the fact that something that should have been dealt with in the boardroom in a very simple way, straightforward manner, cleared with the audit committee, whatever, be dealt with with the hostage justice system in Japan,\u201d he said.\nGhosn is barred from international travel by an Interpol \u201cred notice\u201d that he is seeking to have lifted. However, he has taken on new consulting work via Zoom calls. He has worked with several unnamed automotive startups, as well as environmental technology startups working in wastewater, fertiliser and plastic recycling.\nIn some cases he has taken equity in companies he has advised, although his confinement to Lebanon has prevented him from sitting on boards, he said. He also ruled out working directly in the car industry in the future.\nHe has few qualms about portraying himself as an electric vehicle visionary. Under his watch in 2010 Nissan launched the electric Leaf, but the carmaker is widely acknowledged to have squandered its lead in electric vehicles even before Ghosn\u2019s exit.\n\u201cIn 2007-2008 I was the only one with Elon Musk who [said] clearly that we think the future is going to be electric,\u201d he said. \u201cThe market after 13 years, it\u2019s just saying: \u2018These guys are right, the market is going to be electric.\u2019\u201d\nGhosn said the sky-high valuations of electric car startups such as Musk\u2019s Tesla and the Jeff Bezos-backed Rivian \u2013 some of which are worth more than most major legacy carmakers despite in some cases having minimal revenues \u2013 are not comparable with the likes of Nissan or Renault.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a question of is it too high, is it too low?\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a completely different ballgame. If you look at Tesla or Rivian, I think you should put them in the valorisation of Google, or Facebook, or Nvidia, etc. They are in this category.\u201d\nOn Nissan, which collaborated with Japanese prosecutors to bring him down, Ghosn is unsurprisingly withering, arguing it does not have a vision to exist in the electric car age. The Japanese carmaker has not given up on seeking what it deems to be justice for what it alleges to be Ghosn\u2019s crimes. The company is seeking civil damages from Ghosn in two cases in Japan, one in the Netherlands (the home of the Renault-Nissan alliance offices), and one in the British Virgin Islands.\nA Nissan spokesperson said the company had found \u201cserious misconduct by Carlos Ghosn and Greg Kelly which was later corroborated by multiple government agencies who conducted their own thorough, independent investigations\u201d. They added: \u201cThe facts of the misconduct will be shown during the court proceedings and the law will take its course.\u201d",

        "content": "World Cup hosts are speaking to their Gulf rivals not us, leaving a trail of victims that reflects the company sport now keeps\nOne year to go, 11 in the making. Welcome to Qatar 2022, the final countdown, and a World Cup that for all the noise, the sense of fingers crossed and a gaze averted from the bloodier details, still makes no real sense at all.\nIt was easy to feel a bit distracted as Sepp Blatter read out the word \u201cQatar\u201d, with a slight break in his voice, shortly after lunchtime on 2 December 2010. There was an edge of hysteria in the chamber at Fifa House. Ten minutes earlier Blatter had broken the red wax seal on another padded envelope, and said \u201cRussia\u201d, to protracted squeals of joy.\nThe crowd had already begun to seethe. Flushed-looking media types veered towards the exits. Blatter himself, so priapically alive in the presence of his fellow shiny gleaming golden orb, the World Cup trophy, had begun to wilt a little on stage, perhaps feeling in that moment the first stirrings of the storm that was to come.\nThe Qatar announcement brought a more localised surge of noise. Sat in the row behind, you could feel the whoosh of wind as the winning delegation leapt up, all except for Zinedine Zidane, whose smooth, bald, muscular head remained motionless above the back of his chair. No surprise there. Zidane went on to wear the same look of a man worrying vaguely about his dry cleaning ticket though three successive Champions League victories. But it is also hard to argue with that quizzical expression.\nAs of this weekend we have exactly a year until ignition. The opening game of Qatar 2022 will kick off at 10am GMT on 21 November at the Al Bayt stadium in Al Khor City, 50 miles from Doha on the north-east coast. It has, safe to say, been an unusually fraught journey to this point, trailed still by so many unanswered questions. It\u2019s not about the \u201chow\u201d. We know now that this was a supremely well executed plan to procure a first Gulf World Cup, one that makes the English FA\u2019s freebie handbags, the David Cameron-in-a-waistcoat optics, look toe-curlingly naive.\nZidane was paid a million dollars to express his support for Qatar\u2019s bid, providing a visible face \u2013 along with Pep Guardiola and Alex Ferguson \u2013 for a vast machinery of lobbying and back-channelling. If you believe Blatter the fate of the bid had been set two weeks before Zurich around a lunch table at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace in Paris. Michel Platini has robustly denied switching his vote to Qatar at the request of the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, and crown prince Sheikh Tamim. In Blatter\u2019s version Platini phoned from that lunch saying, \u201cSepp, it\u2019s not going to work, we will have a problem.\u201d Which would at least stand as one of the few unarguably true statements in this whole sorry process.\nOf the people present at that Elys\u00e9e tableau, Sarkozy is currently serving a one-year sentence for political chicanery. Blatter and Platini have been banned from football and pursued by prosecutors. That Fifa voting committee has been ravaged by bans and indictments. Zoom out and the light turns darker.\nQatar is adamant there have been only a tiny number of deaths around its World Cup preparations. A Guardian report concluded at least 6,500 migrant workers from India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka have died in the country since Qatar won hosting rights. If we accept this figure then we must also accept that this is a World Cup washed in blood, played out in grand illuminated structures that will stand as monuments to the suffering of those who built them. Welcome to Qatar 2022, already one of the most mind-boggling sporting stories ever told. Albeit one that still slips from view.\nThe real question is still, why? Why does Qatar want this? The assumption has been that it is a propaganda event. The phrase \u201csportswashing\u201d was coined recently, but that process has circled around Fifa since Benito Mussolini\u2019s World Cup and on into assorted post-war despot affairs. It has been assumed that this is what Qatar wants, to present itself as a more liberal, open state, ready to dance the YMCA, to hand over your limited-edition pint of World Cup lager, to reposition itself from illiberal Gulf power to just another player in the sunshine leisure economy.\nAnd through this door we enter a labyrinth of conflicting principles, a place where no one is ever really clean. Does it matter that Britain and Qatar are so intertwined on every other level? Should the World Cup ever be played in a nation where, for example, homosexuality is still a crime? That was certainly the case in England in 1966, so there is at least some precedent.\nIt makes for a convenient blurring of lines and interests. And how much easier to take a shortcut into this world through pop culture, to expend your resources on paying David Beckham to look handsomely baffled in scenic locations, on the spectacle of Alexa Chung \u201cputting on a leggy display\u201d at the Qatari Fashion Trust Awards.\nLook more closely, however, and this feels blindly Eurocentric. Qatar is one of the wealthiest nations on earth. It is currently the UK\u2019s gas provider of last resort, benevolently directing four spare tankers to these shores only last month. Why would it need to sell itself? Do we think those in power care what a dwindling strain of western liberalism thinks about their attitude to things such as freedom of expression? Are they sweating in the marbled corridors over another arch tweet from user @islingtonguy5555, another moralising column in the pages of Guardian Sport?\nPerhaps the key is to realise that Qatar is speaking to its neighbours, not to us. In a tiny nation ringed by hostile powers, the greatest fear is security. The real currency of the World Cup is noise, eyeballs, the rolling news machine, Beckham in pristine white robes juggling a ball in front of a massive fountain. This is all a form of visibility. And who knows, perhaps Qatar 2022 has already served its key purpose through the blockade crisis, when the fear of coups and takeovers seemed to lurk just out of sight.\nCut back to day zero in Zurich, and that room was already crammed with A-list oddities, from sporting royalty, political royalty and actual royalty to the sight downstairs of the mayor of London, Boris Johnson, shambling through the press zone burbling out details of the voting, rolling his eyes and saying, \u201cwe never stood a chance\u201d; to Vladimir Putin ambling out unexpectedly and sitting in a small chair, centre stage, to take questions from behind his wired-up security.\nQatar 2022, the football entity, will pass in the usual glare of TV product. But this is the company sport keeps now, the forces that have taken us this far, leaving a trail of crooks, goons and victims in its wake. Just watching this thing feels like complicity at times. All we can really do, one year out, is keep telling the story.",

        "content": "Plan for 109 London properties at average of \u00a32m each causes anger in borough hit by housing crisis\nA property developer forecasting a profit of tens of millions of pounds from a luxury apartment complex on London\u2019s \u201cBillionaires Row\u201d, has claimed it cannot afford to subsidise a single affordable home there.\nIn a move that has caused anger in a borough blighted by an affordable housing crisis, Harrison Varma argued its plan to build 109 \u201chigh-end\u201d homes with an indoor pool, gym, spa and underground parking on The Bishops Avenue in north London, left no money for cheaper housing.\nIn planning documents, the firm\u2019s consultants estimated the scheme would make \u00a337m in profit from \u00a3213m in revenue on a road considered one of Britain\u2019s most expensive addresses, where oligarchs from the former Soviet states, Saudi royalty and Nigerian oil barons have bought palatial mansions. The new homes will cost about \u00a32m each on average.\nThe case will focus attention on highly complex negotiations between developers and councils over private housebuilders\u2019 payments towards affordable housing. For the last three years about 50% of all affordable homes in England have been funded by such developer deals. Yet social housebuilding fell 12% in the year to April 2021, according to official figures released on Thursday that show just under 6,000 homes let for the cheapest \u201csocial rents\u201d were completed in England.\nAnalysis by the housing charity Shelter showed just one social home was built in England for every 195 households on waiting lists. About 46,000 other \u201caffordable\u201d homes were built, but these include shared ownership properties and housing that costs 80% of market rent.\nOn the scheme at The Bishops Avenue, Conservative-controlled Barnet council agreed with the developer\u2019s financial viability assessment that it \u201ccannot viably support the provision of any affordable housing\u201d.\nThe borough\u2019s Labour opposition leader, Barry Rawlings, has accused the council of being \u201cutterly negligent\u201d.\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of a housing crisis with nearly 2,500 families trapped in temporary accommodation [in Barnet],\u201d said Rawlings. \u201cIf the council had done its job properly and negotiated the maximum possible \u2026 it would have funded enough affordable homes to re-house most if not all of these families.\u201d\nThe council later accepted a \u00a31.1m payment from Harrison Varma \u2013 sufficient to buy four two-bedroom apartments in cheaper parts of the borough. The deal comes despite a council target that all new developments of over 10 homes must include 40% affordable units.\nAnil Varma, co-owner of the development firm, defended the arrangement saying that given the cost of land and the returns expected by private investors (profits of 17.5% are forecast for the scheme on The Bishops Avenue), affordable housing was not viable.\nHe accepted that affordable housing was desperately needed but said: \u201cIf you don\u2019t get a deal with investors you don\u2019t get anything built.\u201d He added that over the course of the project the rate of return worked out at about 5% a year.\nThe viability assessment argued that the \u00a32m luxury flats would make \u201ca valuable contribution toward housing provision\u201d in Barnet. However the median annual salary in the borough is just under \u00a330,000.\nThe Bishops Avenue is popular with foreign buyers and investors and many plots stand empty or derelict after being left unused for years.\nBut Varma said that if affordable housing was mandatory without viability assessments on such high-value sites \u201cpeople who own the land won\u2019t sell it, they will sit on it\u201d.\nHe said the scheme would make a \u201cphenomenal\u201d contribution to the economy, including \u00a326m in stamp duty receipts, 25% tax on any profit made, 265 construction jobs for two years and a community infrastructure levy of over \u00a33m\nHe said he was not avoiding any affordable housing obligations, that the calculations were scrutinised by the council\u2019s own experts and were published. \u201cWe are not developers making vast amounts of money,\u201d he said, pointing out he had previously made substantial losses.\nA spokesperson for Barnet said providing affordable housing was integral to its housing plan.\n\u201cIn the past 10 years, 3,500 affordable homes have been built in Barnet as part of housing schemes,\u201d they said. \u201cWe are on track to offer 800 more new affordable homes for rent by 2024.\u201d",

        "content": "In Cambodia\u2019s fertile Mekong delta, rice farmers are switching to the varieties loved by the world\u2019s tallest flying bird to help stop its decline\n\u201cSeveral years ago, I counted more than 300 cranes in the wetlands near my rice field,\u201d says farmer Khean Khoay, as he reminisces about the regal-looking eastern sarus crane. Khoay\u2019s village, Koh Chamkar in Kampot province, lies on the outskirts of the Anlung Pring protected landscape in south-west Cambodia, in the fertile and biodiverse Mekong delta.\nThe region has been enriched by centuries of silt deposited by the Mekong, the longest river in south-east Asia and a lifeline for millions who depend on its resources. But as more and more land is converted for agriculture and aquaculture, and the impacts of the climate crisis, such as erosion and saltwater intrusion, are felt, the area\u2019s wildlife has become increasingly threatened.\nAmong the birds affected are the cranes that once visited the land near Khoay\u2019s rice field in large numbers. NatureLife Cambodia, BirdLife International\u2019s partner in the country, says only 91 eastern sarus cranes visited Anlung Pring this year. The future of these birds may lie in the hands of 16 farmers from Koh Chamkar village, including Khoay, who lease their land to NatureLife.\nAt 176cm (just under 6ft), the sarus crane is the tallest flying bird and is classified as vulnerable on the IUCN\u2019s red list of threatened species. But the eastern sarus crane (Antigone antigone sharpii), found in south-east Asia, is considered highly endangered: fewer than 200 are estimated to remain across the wetlands of Cambodia and Vietnam, a sharp decline from nearly 900 in 2002. About half of these visit Anlung Pring during their non-breeding period, arriving before the rice harvest in late December and staying until the dry season ends in May.\nOum Chrein, another farmer involved in the scheme, says: \u201cWhen the crop has not yet been harvested, the cranes walk on the embankments around the fields and eat the grains from [the stalks at] the plot edges.\u201d\nThe farmers who lease their land to NatureLife are paid 10 years\u2019 rent upfront, calculated at 30% higher than their net income from the land. NatureLife, with the support of Cambodia\u2019s ministry of environment and funded by IUCN Netherlands, uses the land to grow native short-grain rice varieties such as boka teourm and pong roluk (Khmer names), which are the cranes\u2019 favourites. At harvest time, half of the crop on the 17 hectares (42 acres) of leased land is left to supplement the diet of the cranes and other birds.\nNatureLife also offers the farmers the option of a daily allowance for cultivating the land, which provides a regular income. Bou Vorsak, acting chief executive at NatureLife, says: \u201cWe commit to the farmers that we will use the land only for growing rice and that the soil will remain suitable for cultivation in the long term.\u201d\nThis arrangement also prevents farmers from selling land to developers or changing its use, thus retaining the area for visiting cranes for the next decade.\nIt is not a scheme, however, that makes money. The first harvest from NatureLife\u2019s leased land programme was in December 2020. The high salinity conditions, along with the use of organic fertilisers and pesticides (instead of chemical ones), meant that the yield was not high, with less than one tonne of rice harvested a hectare, compared with the usual two tonnes. \u201cWe are aware of the yield limitations but we don\u2019t mind as we are keeping [half] the rice for the cranes,\u201d says Vorsak.\nAfter milling and packaging, most of the harvested rice was bought by a local Covid-relief effort, while the rest was sold on the open market. One tonne was set aside to be used as seeds for the next planting season.\nThe rice did not fetch a good price, says Vorsak, because \u201cwe focus on the rice varieties that the cranes prefer. These native varieties are short-grained and not very soft after cooking. They cannot compete with jasmine rice.\u201d\nJasmine rice, which is popular internationally and earns a premium price, is long-grained and aromatic with a soft texture after cooking.\nVorsak adds: \u201cA consumer may not view the native rice varieties we grow as premium quality but we are committed to them, as these are the varieties that the cranes prefer.\u201d\nFarmer Tom Ke, also from Koh Chamkar, didn\u2019t know much about the eastern sarus crane until he joined another NatureLife project earlier this year. \u201cI only recall seeing this strange, tall bird with a red head,\u201d he says. \u201cI have now started to pay more attention to them.\u201d\nUnder this new scheme, participating farmers leave 5% of their rice crop unharvested for the birds. They receive seeds at a subsidised rate, organic fertilisers and pesticides and training in organic farming techniques are provided for free by NatureLife\u2019s partners. \u201cWith more food available for them, I hope they won\u2019t become extinct,\u201d says Ke.\nThe farmers have to agree to 12 guidelines, the most important being that they will cultivate a rice variety preferred by the cranes, they will not use chemicals on their crops, they will not hunt or snare visiting wildlife, and will not encroach on protected land. If the farmers adhere to all criteria, NatureLife pays the market rate for the 5% of the crop left unharvested.\nMore than 40 farmers from Koh Chamkar and nearby Chress village have joined the initiative. In August, they planted boka teourm on their plots, bringing almost 38 hectares under the programme. The first harvest will be in December, 5% of which will be left standing for the cranes.\nVorsak is hopeful that these crane conservation initiatives are just the beginning and will garner more support.\n\u201cTogether with these landowning rice farmers and private landowners, NatureLife\u2019s long-term vision is to protect more than 1,000 hectares of the landscape for the cranes,\u201d he says.\nFind more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",

        "content": "The confirmation of Charles F Sams III marks a symbolic moment for many Indigenous communities\nCharles \u201cChuck\u201d F Sams III made history this week in becoming the first-ever Native American confirmed to lead the National Park Service.\nSams, an enrolled tribal member of the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, received unanimous consent by the US Senate on Thursday after being nominated by Joe Biden in August.\nSam\u2019s confirmation comes nearly 150 years after US leaders began the practice of establishing national parks upon ancestral lands that were often violently seized from Indigenous communities.\nNow, with the park service managing more than 400 areas across every state, along with the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, some Indigenous leaders see Sams\u2019 appointment as a potential path toward healing from old but deeply rooted wounds.\n\u201cI see this as an opportunity to reconcile that past, to heal that past, and to recognize the deep knowledge and wisdom that a Native American brings to that post,\u201d said Fawn Sharp, president of the National Congress of American Indians and vice-president of the Quinault Indian Nation.\nIn 1872, President Ulysses S Grant signed the Yellowstone National Park Protection Act into law, creating the country\u2019s first national park. The establishment of this site and many others in the ensuing years have been hailed as a triumph, but came at a cost.\nIn an interview with the Guardian, Jeanette Wolfley, a former University of New Mexico School of Law professor, explained that members of the Shoshone-Bannock Tribes once inhabited the area now known as Yellowstone national park. She said the park\u2019s establishment had had a \u201cdevastating\u201d effect on the community as members were barred from returning.\nToday, some tribal reservations actually overlap with national park spaces. For example, the Canyon de Chelly national monument is located within the Navajo Nation.\nRecognizing the history of these parks, Jonathan Jarvis, the last Senate-approved National Park Service director (he left the post in 2017), said over the last 20 years, there had been an effort by park service leaders to establish stronger relationships with Indigenous residents. During his tenure, for example, the agency restored the rights of traditionally affiliated nations to collect plants within a park\u2019s boundaries.\nSams, who has over 25 years of experience working in state and Indigenous governments as well as the non-profit natural resource and conservation management fields, could expand on this work.\nJarvis said Sams would be responsible for implementing Biden\u2019s park service agenda and would probably need to address such key issues as the parks\u2019 major maintenance backlog and infrastructure needs, the impact of the climate crisis on these spaces and the parks\u2019 response to Covid. But he will also have the opportunity to set his own vision for the parks.\nHe could further boost Indigenous nations\u2019 ability to access key swaths of traditional vegetation by encouraging park officials to reach out to them directly to help establish collection agreements, explained Jarvis. And, although the park service already allows Indigenous people to access these spaces for ceremonies, he could issue a director\u2019s order making this process easier.\nJarvis said there was huge potential for Sams to \u201clook where there are opportunities for true co-management, true stewardship in partnership with tribes\u201d of these national park spaces.\nLast month, Sams said in a statement as part of his nomination hearing in front of the Senate energy and natural resources committee: \u201cIf confirmed, I will bring this spirit of consultation to my service as director. I look forward to consulting with neighboring communities, stakeholders, local, state and tribal governments, and members of Congress, even when the conversations and topics are challenging.\u201d\nBut for some Indigenous people, healing from historical injustice is not simply a matter of boosting consultations or access to national parks; it\u2019s a matter of returning the lands.\nSharp, president of the National Congress of American Indians, said she would like to see national parks returned to Indigenous people. But she cautioned that returning these spaces would need to be an individualized process.\n\u201cTribes are unique and distinct. And the national parks in some parts of the country may have tribal nations who are prepared and ready to assume management over those and others may not,\u201d she said.\nKat Brigham, chair of the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation board of trustees, said she was extremely happy at the prospect of Sams taking his new position. She said she expected him to lead from \u201cthe tribal perspective\u201d, which she described as \u201ctaking care of the land, so the land can take care of you\u201d.\nShe said she hoped to see him help to spread awareness of the true history of these sites. She gave the example of Celilo Falls in Oregon, which was once a great gathering space for Indigenous people.\n\u201cHe knows, for decades, that the tribes have been trying to get the federal and state agencies to start looking at things from a tribal perspective,\u201d she said. \u201cI think he will be asking us a lot more questions. And they\u2019ll be involved more.\u201d",

He would lead huge groups of walkers across the bay in bare feet, his jeans and shirt sleeves rolled up and a staff in his hand, making sure his guests crossed safely, usually from Arnside to Kents Bank.\nHe was forced into a reluctant retirement in 2019 after struggling to recover from two hernia operations, guiding walkers in his tractor in his later years. \u201cI thought I could go on for ever. My dad lived until he was 103,\u201d Robinson told the Guardian then, clearly not quite at peace with the idea of hanging up the whistle he used to stop walkers going off course. \u201cI always thought the day I retire would be the worst day of my life.\u201d\nIn 1963 Robinson and his wife, Olive, moved into Guides Farm, a ramshackle cottage right on the coast in Kents Bank which comes with the job. In the early years they had no electricity or running water and even in recent years an open fire was their main source of heating. They were allowed to stay after his retirement, and Olive died there in August, aged 96.\nRobinson loved the celebrity aspect of the job and never tired of regaling visitors with his more unusual crossings. Most traversed the bay on foot \u2013 though Prince Philip used a horse-drawn carriage.\nHis voice would drop when he talked of the Bay\u2019s darkest hour, when 23 Chinese cockle pickers died in 2004.\nIf someone proposed an idea that tickled Robinson, he usually gave it a go. Once he crossed with 27 geese as a fundraising stunt for an arthritis sufferer. On another occasion he hid in the bay from Anneka Rice for an episode of Treasure Hunt (\u201cI was wondering if the helicopter and crew were ever going to find us, but eventually they did,\u201d he recalled in one of the many volumes of his memoirs). Once he took Rick Stein out fishing for flounder. The TV chef said the flounder were \u201cequally as good as fresh halibut\u201d, Robinson remembered proudly in 2019.\nEarlier this year he joined his successor, Michael Wilson, guiding a group of naturists across the bay. \u201cWhen we asked if he was getting out of his tractor he simply replied, \u2018no, I have the best view from up here!\u2019\u201d remembered Wilson on Saturday.\nA family spokesman said: \u201cHe pioneered fundraising cross-bay walks and was responsible for leading 6,000 charity walkers a year, avoiding the treacherous quicksands and dangerous areas.\u201d\nIn a statement, Wilson and other marshals from the Guide Over Sands Trust said: \u201cIt is with great sadness that we write this post. Last night at the grand age of 88 our beloved Cedric Robinson closed his eyes for the last time, Cedric is now at peace and is with his wife Olive who he missed so much.\n\u201cCedric had a huge following and we know that this news will make the community shed a tear upon reading this.\n\u201cCedric joined us this year out on the sand \u2013 even though he had retired he kept going all he could. Now Cedric it is time to rest your sandy feet and keep an eye on us from up there.\u201d",

The subs made a difference and gave us some real energy when Villa were starting to flag at the end.\u201d\nDespite their superiority on the ball, City had only three shots on target before half-time with the organised away side set up by their manager, Carla Ward, to absorb pressure. \u201cWe came in at half-time happy with the performance, we kept to the game plan,\u201d Ward said.\nVilla\u2019s turnaround under Ward has been impressive. By half-time at the Academy Stadium last season they were six goals down on their way to a heaviest ever WSL defeat, with the game ending 7-0.\nIt has, perhaps, been the lack of goals that has been more worrying than City\u2019s defensive issues given the strength of players available in attack, while the defensive injury crisis provides answers for the failings at the back. So there was some significant relief when the deadlock was broken in the style expected from the home team. A wonderful run and cutback from Lauren Hemp at the byline found Weir and the Scottish forward sent the ball looping into the far corner.\nThree minutes later and, with the pressure lifted, City doubled their lead. After a scramble from a corner Stanway clipped the ball backwards around the centre-back Elisha N\u2019Dow and into the net.\nHaving impressed in the first half the Villa goalkeeper, Hannah Hampton, was at fault for City\u2019s third. Racing out to cut out a corner she played the ball straight to the feet of the City substitute Raso who lashed it back past her into the far corner via a deflection.\nRaso was then in action once more, going on a mazy run into the box before cutting the ball across the face of goal for Hemp to power in at the far post. It was Raso again for the fifth. The ball pinged around the Villa box before Hemp smashed a shot off the bar and Raso was on hand to power in the rebound.\n\u201cWhen we went 2-0 down we went to try and put pressure on them so we changed the formation,\u201d Ward said. \u201cI thought we could step on to them a bit and cause them problems and we probably should have kept our shape. It\u2019s probably the worst feeling I\u2019ve had since I\u2019ve been a manager.\u201d",

        "content": "First ever report shows 70% of respondents have suffered at the hands of a partner or members of their extended family\n\u201cToxic cultural practices\u201d and a lack of culturally sensitive services means many women who are victims of domestic and sexual abuse in the Sikh community are suffering in silence, according to the first comprehensive report into the issue.\nThe report by Sikh Women\u2019s Aid (SWA), the UK\u2019s only frontline service for Sikh women, will be released later this week to coincide with the launch of the United Nations\u2019 women\u2019s annual 16 days of activism against gender-based violence. It creates a harrowing picture of the prevalence and effect of domestic abuse and child sexual abuse in the Sikh community.\nThe research was carried out over a four-month period over the summer, during which time SWA distributed anonymous surveys within the community across the UK.\nResearchers received replies from almost 700 respondents, and, of those, 70% said they had experienced domestic abuse, nearly half had experienced incidents with more than one perpetrator, including female members of their family. Over a third of respondents said that they had experienced child sexual abuse, and of these incidents, one in seven involved more than one perpetrator. Most victims knew their abuser, and nearly half of the incidents of abuse took place at home.\nGender equality is one of the core beliefs of the Sikh faith, but, says the SWA, patriarchal societal practices stemming from cultural traditions, such as concepts of honour, mean that many survivors are afraid to speak out.\nAwareness of these issues is growing, however, following several high-profile cases, including the murder of 43-year-old Ranjit Gill from Milton Keynes earlier this year. She was stabbed 18 times by her \u201cdominating and bullying\u201d husband Anil Gill in an alcohol and cocaine-fuelled attack.\nWhile domestic and sexual abuse affect all ethnicities, cultures and backgrounds, the founders of Sikh Women\u2019s Aid and authors of the report, Sahdaish Pall and Sukhvinder Kaur, said that a lack of specialist support that met the needs of women in the Sikh community was creating \u201ca generation of young women who are completely lost\u201d.\nThe findings of the report will be used by SWA to create services tailored to the specific needs and cultural nuances that victims of abuse within the Sikh Panjabi community face.\n\u201cOut of all the South Asian communities, Sikh women are the least likely to come forward about abuse. We come across as a very affluent, educated and giving community, and that reputation makes it very difficult for Sikh women to come forward,\u201d said Pall.\n\u201cThere are issues specific to our culture, like the link between alcohol and domestic and sexual violence. We have a huge drinking culture among men, and the amounts people consume exacerbate issues.\u201d\n\u201cThere is also a lack of education around things like coercive control. The parental generation\u2019s view is if you haven\u2019t been beaten up, that\u2019s not abuse. There\u2019s often an intergenerational and toxic normalisation and acceptance of violence against women.\u201d\nThe taboo around discussing sexual abuse is particularly widespread, and issues such as victim-shaming and cultural concepts of honour and shame, which have no basis in religious teachings, are often weaponised against victims to ensure their silence.\nNimrit*, 39, from London, who was abused by her uncle between the ages of eight and 13, said that her family\u2019s fear of not finding a good husband for her meant she had to stay silent about her abuse.\n\u201cFrom the outside, we looked like the perfect family, but behind closed doors was another story. My uncle was a pillar of the community who was active in the gurdwara [Sikh place of worship]. He would come and stay at our house and during those visits, he would abuse me,\u201d she said.\n\u201cEventually, I told my cousin and made her promise not to tell anyone, but she told her mum who told my mum. My mum slapped my face and began sobbing and saying \u2018who will marry you now?\u2019 She said if I wasn\u2019t a virgin, I would have to get married straight away, so I lied and said he only touched me. We had to keep it a secret from my dad because it was her brother, and to this day he hasn\u2019t a clue. It kills me when I hear him saying nice things about my uncle.\nShe continued: \u201cI had to keep it a secret to protect the family but secrets like that eat you up inside. A guy from uni once tapped my shoulder to get my attention and I screamed in his face.\n\u201cI had an arranged marriage and the physical side of the relationship was hard as I got flashbacks but I couldn\u2019t tell my husband about my past so I just shut down. I\u2019m just trying to live a normal life.\n\u201cThere is more awareness about these issues in the community now compared to when I was a kid but people need to speak out without being punished for it or the abuse won\u2019t stop.\u201d\nSexual abuse in the Sikh community is \u201calmost like the perfect crime\u201d according to Sukhvinder Kaur because the likelihood of someone being prosecuted is so low. \u201cNot only is there a lack of convictions but the community is geared towards protecting the reputation of perpetrators,\u201d she said.\nOne of the most sensitive issues the report tackles is grooming. The report found that the widely held perception within the community that the majority of victims of sexual abuse were exploited by non-Sikh grooming gangs is false. This finding in particular has led to a backlash against the report\u2019s authors.\n\u201cThere is more abuse taking place where the perpetrator is known to the victim and the family. Our community is in denial about that,\u201d said Kaur.\nDame Vera Baird, the victims\u2019 commissioner for England and Wales, who will be at the official launch of the report later this week, said that it highlighted the need for \u201cculturally appropriate support organisations for black, Asian and other minority women who are neglected by the criminal justice system and in the provision of specialist support\u201d.\n\u201cI welcome this report although it is hard to [do that] when it shows that there is rampant hidden violence against women and girls in the Sikh community,\u201d she said.\nFormer chief prosecutor, Nazir Afzal added: \u201cIt\u2019s a testament to the courage of SWA that we have this report at all, given the hostility they have faced. Nothing in this report should surprise anyone involved in safeguarding.\n\u201cAny strategy that focuses on what men \u2018should do\u2019 rather than [on] male violence will always fail. Any successful response will involve addressing male power while simultaneously supporting victims.\u201d\n* Not her real name",

It has the lowest vaccination rate in western Europe, and recorded another 15,809 cases on Friday.\nThe country will go into a full lockdown for the third time on Monday until at least 12 December. Tighter restrictions have also been announced in the Czech Republic and Slovakia.\nKluge said factors such as the winter season, when there is normally an increase in viral infections, and low vaccine coverage were responsible for the increase in cases. He called for more people to get vaccinated, basic public health measures to be implemented and new treatments to be developed, but said mandatory vaccination should be the last resort.\n\u201cCovid-19 has become once again the number one cause of mortality in our region,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cWe know what needs to be done\u201d to fight the disease.\nRioting erupted in the Netherlands on Friday in response to new Covidrestrictions.

        "content": "Sit down with Tucker Carlson, one of Fox\u2019s most extreme hosts, is likely to cement Rittenhouse\u2019s popularity among conservatives\nKyle Rittenhouse, the teenager acquitted of murdering two men during anti-racism protests, is set to appear next week on Fox News\u2019s Tucker Carlson show amid fears that the not guilty verdict in the Kenosha killings might encourage militia violence.\nRittenhouse\u2019s shooting of three people, including two he killed, during demonstrations in the Wisconsin city split the US. For some it made him a vigilante out to make trouble while for others he was a gun-toting hero defending property from a mob.\nRittenhouse became a heroic figure for conservatives during his trial as many rightwing figures raised money for his legal defense. His coming interview by Carlson \u2013 one of Fox\u2019s most controversial and extreme hosts \u2013 is likely to cement that popularity. The Monday night sit down is already being heavily promoted by the conservative channel.\nCarlson has risen to prominence as the most influential media figure for conservatives, even amid numerous controversies.\nCarlson has advocated for multiple baseless conspiracy theories on his show and been condemned for dog-whistling racism. The Fox News host is releasing a series that argues that the 6 January Capitol insurrection was orchestrated by leftist Antifa group. He has also bemoaned the Democratic party for trying to \u201creplace the current electorate\u201d with \u201cvoters from the third world\u201d through immigration policies: what is known as the \u201cgreat replacement theory\u201d that has originated in the far right.\nThe Fox News host appears to not only have interviewed Rittenhouse for the show, but has also filmed a short documentary on Rittenhouse during his trial. A clip of Rittenhouse in the backseat of a car, seemingly right after his not guilty verdict, was previewed on Carlson\u2019s show Friday night.\n\u201cThe jury reached the correct verdict. Self defense is not illegal,\u201d Rittenhouse says in the clip.\nMark Richards, an attorney for Rittenhouse, told CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo that a Fox film crew was embedded with the defense team for the duration of the trial, which Richards did not approve of. \u201cI threw them out of the room several times,\u201d Richards said. \u201cI don\u2019t think a film crew is appropriate for something like this.\u201d\nRichards told Cuomo that the people who fundraised for Rittenhouse\u2019s defense were \u201ctrying to raise money\u201d and that Rittenhouse\u2019s family and his advisers approved of the film crew being there during the trial.\nIn the aftermath of the Rittenhouse verdict and the success of his self-defense argument, some experts have raised concerns that Rittenhouse\u2019s verdict will empower extremist movements and provoke violence in the name of vigilantism.\n\u201cIt has never taken more than a whisper of approval to fan the flames of militant right action, and the Kenosha acquittal is a shout,\u201d wrote Kathleen Belew, a historian who studies the white power movement, on Twitter.\nJeri Bonavia, executive director of the Wave Educational Fund, an organization in Wisconsin that aims to prevent gun violence, told NBC News that the trial is \u201cfeeding this idea that individual citizens need to be out there, not as part of a functioning society, but as these rogue dispensers of justice\u201d.\nHours after Rittenhouse\u2019s not guilty verdict was delivered, US attorney general Merrick Garland spoke at the swearing in of Manhattan\u2019s new US attorney and emphasized the role the justice department plays in protecting civil rights, noting the department\u2019s history in combating the Ku Klux Klan and protecting voting rights.\nAt the ceremony, Damian Williams, who is the first Black top federal law enforcement official overseeing the southern district of New York, one of the country\u2019s most powerful federal courts, said that he\u2019s establishing a civil rights unit in his office\u2019s criminal division to concentrate greater resources on problems worsening in \u201ctroubled times\u201d.\n\u201cWhite supremacist groups are on the march. Antisemitism is on the march. Anti-Asian violence is on the march. Abuse of the most vulnerable in our society is on the march, and that includes, by the way, abuse of incarcerated women and men who lose their liberty but not their right to be kept safe,\u201d Williams said.\nPatches of protests were seen in cities across the country on Friday in response to the Rittenhouse verdict.\nThe protests, including one outside of the courthouse in Kenosha, were largely peaceful. Protests in Portland, where far-right groups have clashed with leftwing activists, were declared a riot last night after demonstrators started to break windows and throw objects at police.",

The FBI interrogated union leaders and Mob bosses and henchmen and began receiving tips that his body was buried in New Jersey landfill hundreds of miles from where he was abducted, found nothing, and filed the tips.\nYears later, agents searched various locations in Michigan, including a farm, a driveway and beneath a swimming pool. Back in New Jersey, where by reputation Italian-American Mafiosi still hold sway over carting and trucking, criminal folklore has focused on the nearby Giants Stadium, which was under construction at the time of Hoffa\u2019s disappearance.\nBut the theory advanced by The Irishman \u2013 that Hoffa had been murdered and incinerated \u2013 has largely been rejected by Hoffa experts. Dan Moldea, author of several books on Hoffa\u2019s disappearance, told the Times that the New Jersey site is \u201c100%\u201d credible.\nIn July, Moldea published an article in Detroit Deadline placing Hoffa\u2019s unmarked grave at a 53-acre landfill in Jersey City, New Jersey. He pointed to an FBI report four months after Hoffa disappeared that cited a visit Teamster boss, convicted murderer and FBI informant Ralph Picardo had received from Steve Andretta, an alleged Hoffa murder co-conspirator. The tip described Hoffa being stuffed into a 55-gallon drum, loaded onto a truck and shipped to New Jersey.",

He pointed out that there were still \u201cmany millions\u201d across the UK who were still not fully vaccinated, while some have not had any Covid shots at all.\nWhitehall sources this weekend played down the immediate need for \u201cplan B\u201d restrictions, pointing to data published this week showing the protection offered by a booster shot.\nAlongside maximising the uptake of third doses, officials hope the lifting of restrictions earlier in the year will mean that Britain avoids the winter surges currently being experienced in many European countries.\nHowever, Edmunds, who is a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, said: \u201cThere are still many millions of people here in the UK who have not been fully vaccinated \u2013 it\u2019s essential now.\n\u201cWhat you see now, particularly in central Europe, with this very rapid increase in cases, [is] the importance of vaccination, how critical it is that people who need their boosters should come forward as rapidly as possible and get vaccinated.\n\u201cThose who are still unvaccinated \u2013 and there are many unfortunately out there \u2013 should come forward and be vaccinated as rapidly as possible.\u201d\nHe added: \u201c[The current surge in Europe] shows how quickly things can go wrong.

Habitat loss through clearing for farmland and overgrazing, as well as climate change, has let to population declines across a wide expanse across Utah, Wyoming and Montana where as much as 90% of its natural environment has been lost.\nIn 2017, the Trump administration tried to scale back conservation efforts adopted when Biden was vice-president two years earlier that affected 10m acres of open land across the west of the US. But a federal court blocked Trump\u2019s changes.\nBut environmentalists argue that Biden\u2019s 2015 conservation plans were in themselves insufficient to close loopholes allowing for grazing and drilling on public land.\nResurgent disagreements over greater sage grouse protections are now likely to grow more intense, with Republican-run states clashing with wildlife advocates over how much space the birds need to survive.\nGreater sage grouse populations have dropped 65% since 1986, government scientists have concluded.\nThe Montana Democratic senator Jon Tester has said he believes Biden\u2019s new Bureau of Land Management (BLM) director, Tracy Stone-Manning, a former aide, would pursue a collaborative, balanced approach that would protect the grouse from becoming an endangered species.\nBut western-state Republicans \u2013 including Montana\u2019s governor, Greg Gianforte, and Wyoming\u2019s governor, Mark Gordon, along with aligned senators, have said states should be given deference to wildlife management and federal lands kept open for energy exploration and grazing.\nAccording to the BLM, the agency will examine how climate change is adding to pressures on the grouse population. Culver pointed to data showing wildfires burned almost 10,700sq miles of the bird\u2019s habitat since 2016.\nEarlier this year, federal officials said that they would consider bans on new mining to help the birds. But even reimposing Obama-Biden era protections may be insufficient to prevent disturbance of sage grouse habitat, environmentalists have warned.\n\u201cThe Obama administration did their best to please all the different ends of the political spectrum. But in the end they didn\u2019t please anybody and they didn\u2019t give the sage grouse the habitat they needed,\u201d Erik Molvar of the Western Watersheds Project told the Associated Press.",

        "content": "As the final whistle blew Eddie Howe may well have felt more than a little claustrophobic. It was not merely that Newcastle\u2019s new manager was trapped in his hotel room at the start of a 10-day quarantine after his positive Covid-19 test on Friday, but that his team seem stuck in an unpleasantly tight spot.\nAt the end of an at times ridiculously open game replete with attacking thrills and kamikaze defending, Newcastle were left bottom of the Premier League, still awaiting their first win of the season.\nEven worse, they had offered Thomas Frank\u2019s Brentford renewed hope by generously helping the visitors stem a run of four straight League defeats. Howe had promised excitement and front-foot football and his team duly delivered it but, as he watched the first game of his tenure relayed on a screen in his hotel across the city, Steve Bruce\u2019s successor surely wondered if \u201cfinding a way to win\u201d might have been a better manifesto pledge.\nHowe\u2019s eloquent talk of \u201cphilosophy\u201d and \u201cprinciples\u201d is important and admirable but, right now, Newcastle are in real peril of relegation and, no matter how scrappily, could desperately do with somehow securing six points from forthcoming home games against Norwich and Burnley.\nNot that Jason Tindall was too downhearted. \u201cWe have a squad of exciting, attacking players and, on another day, we\u2019d have won,\u201d said Howe\u2019s assistant and stand-in. \u201cIt was a step in the right direction.\u201d\nThe events of the 10th and 11th minutes offered the absent guest of honour a foretaste of contradictions to come. First Jamaal Lascelles gave Newcastle the briefest of leads, rising above all comers to head Matt Ritchie\u2019s corner beyond \u00c1lvaro Fern\u00e1ndez.\nThe celebrations had barely subsided before his side self destructed. Sergi Can\u00f3s slipped the ball to Ivan Toney and a striker sold to Peterborough by Newcastle in 2018 revelled in taking a stellar steadying touch, swivelling imperiously and squeezing a shot beneath Karl Darlow\u2019s body.\nDarlow should have done better but was let down by some all too typically slapdash defending, while Toney deserves considerable credit for that adhesive initial touch.\nIndeed on a day when Saint-Maximin, Joelinton and Jonjo Shelvey all impressed for Newcastle, Toney stole the show. Already on an evident adrenaline high, Brentford\u2019s centre-forward was being afforded far too much space and he soon had the ball in the back of the net again.\nOn that occasion Howe\u2019s defence were rescued by an offside flag but they fell behind when Can\u00f3s lost Ritchie and delivered a deep cross. It was met by the on-rushing Rico Henry whose late dash into the box went untracked by the home rearguard, enabling his header to defy Darlow.\nBruce claimed Joelinton wasn\u2019t overly interested in goalscoring but the \u00a340m Brazilian striker appeared to contest that assertion as Allan Saint-Maximin\u2019s blocked shot was deflected into his path.\nAfter expertly manoeuvring the ball on to his left foot, Joelinton, alternating flanks with Saint-Maximin at the front of Howe\u2019s 3-4-3 formation, lashed an exquisite finish past Fern\u00e1ndez. Maybe he isn\u2019t \u201ca very poor man\u2019s Ivan Toney\u201d after all.\nToney, though, remained on a mission to destabilise a former employer worryingly susceptible to counterattacks and delighted in causing chaos during the preamble to Frank Onyeka\u2019s shot taking a hefty deflection off Lascelles before flashing beyond a wrong-footed Darlow.\nWith Saint-Maximin provoking similar panic among Frank\u2019s defence things oscillated wildly from end to end but Tindall, had seen enough.\nIn a highly inspired tactical re-vamp, Howe\u2019s assistant \u2013 in \u201cconstant telephone dialogue\u201d with his boss \u2013 duly replaced the underwhelming Joe Willock and immensely disappointing Fabian Sch\u00e4r with Ryan Fraser and Sean Longstaff as he switched to a back four.\nWhen Fraser met Saint-Maximin\u2019s pass and swung in a deceptively curving cross it was met by the accelerating Frenchman whose sublime first-time volley proved far too good for Fern\u00e1ndez.\nAs Saint-Maximin performed a series of acrobatic back flips Frank was torn between pride and disappointment. \u201cWe were at a big party we weren\u2019t invited to and showed great mentality,\u201d said Brentford\u2019s manager. \u201cBut we didn\u2019t defend well enough \u2013 we gave far too much away.\u201d\nHowe surely sympathises.",

        "content": "Nothing can entirely erase England\u2019s disappointment at losing the 2019 World Cup final but their future is looking ever rosier. Turning over the world champions in the final seconds of a stirring contest in front of a roaring home crowd is never an everyday occurrence and the 80th-minute penalty from Marcus Smith which belatedly settled this extraordinary game was no more than his gallant, persevering side deserved.\nFew, if any, teams in international rugby end up on the winning side having conceded 18 penalties to their opponents\u2019 eight but the try count of three to one against the planet\u2019s meanest defence was ultimately the more pertinent statistic. It summed up the see-sawing nature of a contest which both sides appeared to have won and lost on at least a couple of occasions before the wildly dramatic late denouement.\nThe Springboks, 14-3 down early on, looked to have edged it before the visiting replacement Fran\u00e7ois Steyn was penalised in front of his own posts for catching Smith with a knee on the floor. Having losing Manu Tuilagi to injury after just eight minutes England knew precisely how the vastly experienced Steyn felt: they had just watched him kick a long-range penalty with six minutes left which felt, at the time, as if it might seal the deal.\nA storming breakaway try from the England replacement Raffi Quirke with 15 minutes left was another key moment, as was the 76th minute sin-binning of the South Africa skipper, Siya Kolisi, for taking out Joe Marchant in the air. Without him the 14-man Springboks began to fray at the edges, with England\u2019s substituted captain, Courtney Lawes, even running on to the field late on as passions threatened to overflow.\nIt made for a fabulous sporting ding-dong right from the outset. The game was barely six minutes old when England, looking aggressive and positive, made their early possession and territory count. Once the ball had been moved left and a miss-pass from Henry Slade had fetched up in Tuilagi\u2019s hands there was never going to be any stopping the big man. With Jesse Kriel overcommitting in defence, Tuilagi rampaged over past Handr\u00e9 Pollard\u2019s despairing last-gasp tackle.\nSadly for England it was to be Tuilagi\u2019s last contribution, the centre walking disconsolately away after injuring himself in the process. England, though, were in no mood to retreat back into their shells.\nAgain they stretched the visiting defence out wide and from a ruck less than 10 metres out Ben Youngs fed his fast-rising Leicester teammate and fellow son of Norfolk, Freddie Steward, who crashed over past Cobus Reinach and Kolisi. Smith again coolly slotted the tricky conversion and at 14-3 up England were flying.\nThey were also enjoying some joy at the scrums where the referee, Andrew Brace, had clearly not been reading all the pre-game column inches about South Africa\u2019s respected set piece. Gradually, though, the visitors began to compose themselves and work their way back into the contest. Pollard, who scored 22 points in the Springboks\u2019 World Cup final triumph in Japan, slotted four well-struck penalties from a range of angles and distances to remind England of the importance of keeping their discipline.\nWith Brace also keeping a close eye on the breakdown some of the defensive hits on both sides were huge, not least a full-frontal tackle by Ox Nch\u00e9 on his opposite number, Bevan Rodd. England\u2019s clutch of inexperienced forwards, though, could be proud of their efforts and the hosts fully deserved their 17-12 half-time advantage.\nBut South Africa have made an artform of not panicking and finishing games strongly. The first-half stats may not have been pretty \u2013 when was the last time South Africa failed to win a single first-half scrum or collectively beat just four defenders? \u2013 but with their \u201cbomb squad\u201d limbering up on the touchline there was no sense of premature English triumphalism in the air.\nThe hosts were lucky to escape when Kolisi, crucially as it turned out, failed to put Kriel away after brilliant approach work from Damian de Allende and Pollard, having previously nailed everything, suddenly contrived to miss two kickable penalties.\nThere was another huge roar to greet the arrival of Joe Marler in place of Rodd while Steward at full-back was having another outstanding afternoon.\nSouth Africa, though, appeared to have found their second wind as the game entered its decisive phase. A fifth Pollard penalty brought them back to within two points and only a late smother tackle from the replacement Max Malins prevented Kwagga Smith from putting the Boks ahead for the first time.\nWith the pressure and penalty count both rising, however, Alex Dombrandt was adjudged offside at a ruck in front of the posts and Elton Jantjies, Pollard\u2019s replacement, slotted the easy kick to make it 18-17. Could England respond? The answer was an emphatic \u201cyes\u201d as Slade slid Marchant through a midfield gap from a first-phase lineout ball and the speedy Quirke raced 30 metres for a dream first Test try.\nStill the intrigue was not over as South Africa, with advantage being played close to the line, swung the ball left and the prolific Makazole Mapimpi touched down his 20th try in 25 Tests.\nJantjes could not land the conversion but with six minutes left up stepped the vastly experienced Steyn for what he must have thought was the decisive act. Little did he know what the fates still had in store.",

        "content": "The American businesswoman, and the prime minister\u2019s ex-lover, is to let  officials at London City Hall see extracts from her diaries\nA fresh inquiry has opened into Boris Johnson\u2019s relationship with Jennifer Arcuri after the US businesswoman dramatically agreed to assist officials, paving the way for the prime minister to face possible criminal investigation.\nArcuri has formally offered to help the Greater London Authority (GLA) ethics watchdog by allowing it to inspect extracts of her diary entries chronicling her affair with Johnson and agreeing to be questioned for the first time by investigators over the relationship.\nThe contemporaneous diary excerpts, disclosed in the Observer last week by the journalist John Ware, reveal how Johnson allegedly overruled the advice of staff to promote the business interests of Arcuri and win her affections.\nArcuri\u2019s decision to cooperate with the GLA monitoring officer reopens the prospect of Johnson facing an investigation for a potential criminal offence of misconduct in public office.\nIn a previous investigation into Johnson\u2019s business relationship with the then 27-year-old Arcuri, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) did not have access to Arcuri\u2019s handwritten diary entries in which she made \u201cverbatim\u201d notes of the highlights of his telephone calls and their conversations.\nThe police watchdog eventually concluded it would not be launching a criminal inquiry into whether Johnson abused his position as London mayor to \u201cbenefit and reward\u201d Arcuri. Investigators also never interviewed Arcuri or received testimony from the tech entrepreneur.\nHer evidence is potentially even more critical because the original IOPC inquiry was also hampered by the deletion of key email and phone records at City Hall that prevented the watchdog from \u201creviewing relevant evidence\u201d.\nThe latest developments into allegations that Johnson offered to help Arcuri launch her tech business while simultaneously pursuing her for sex will pile more pressure on the prime minister, raising fresh questions over his integrity and lax approach to probity in public life after weeks of sleaze allegations have engulfed his party.\nAfter the Observer last week revealed some of the explosive entries in Arcuri\u2019s diaries, Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Angela Rayner, wrote to the GLA\u2019s monitoring officer, Emma Strain, asking that she urgently refer the new evidence to the IOPC to \u201clook again\u201d at its decision to rule out a criminal investigation.\nStrain, in turn, contacted the Observer for assistance in obtaining Arcuri\u2019s diaries so she could assess whether the issue was a \u201cserious complaint\u201d that appeared to constitute or involve a criminal offence being committed.\nIf Strain judges that the issue is serious, she will formally refer the matter back to the IOPC to decide if it will investigate Johnson over the criminal offence of misconduct in public office.\nAfter several days of weighing up whether she wanted to assist the GLA, Arcuri finally agreed and at 7pm on Friday sent an email to Strain, head of its ethics watchdog.\n\u201cI am prepared to show you or your investigators copies of the relevant pages,\u201d Arcuri wrote. \u201cHowever, I currently reside in the United States, so it would mean you or they [the IOPC] travelling here for that purpose. In that event, I would also be prepared to be interviewed, if that assists.\u201d\nIf that is not possible, Arcuri has authorised veteran journalist Ware, with whom she has \u201centrusted\u201d her diaries, to show investigators relevant pages detailing her business dealings with Johnson.\nArcuri handed the first tranche of her diaries to Ware after the 2019 general election and following his ITV documentary in which he accused the prime minister of having a \u201ctenuous relationship to the truth\u201d after Johnson\u2019s repeated insistence that \u201cabsolutely everything was done with full propriety\u201d regarding his relationship with Arcuri. Ware was sent a second tranche of material from Arcuri in May 2020.Ware approached Arcuri after recent comments by Johnson about public probity and she consented to allow publication of some of her diary extracts. One Arcuri diary entry reveals how Johnson offered to be her \u201cthrottle\u201d in an attempt to accelerate her business career, claims that may reopen the possibility of Johnson facing a potential criminal investigation into misconduct allegations.\nIt recalled how Johnson told her: \u201cHow can I be the thrust \u2013 the throttle \u2013 your mere footstep as you make your career? Tell me: how I can help you?\u201d\nThe diary entries also suggest that Johnson broke the rules governing ethical conduct in public office in his dealings with Arcuri.\nResponding to the Arcuri revelations last week, a government spokesperson said: \u201cAs mayor, Boris Johnson followed all the legal requirements in the Greater London Assembly\u2019s [sic] code of conduct at the time.\u201d",

        "content": "State government urged to manage and resource recent property acquisitions to protect native species and habitat\nIn June last year, the New South Wales environment minister, Matt Kean, announced the acquisition of Narriearra station, a sweeping property on Karengappa country in the state\u2019s north-west, for the national parks estate.\nDotted with huge temporary wetlands that fill and attract waterbirds during inland floods, the 153,415 hectare outback cattle station was the single largest purchase of private land for a national park in the state\u2019s history.\nThis year, the government made further purchases in the far west, adding Langidoon and Metford stations and Avenel/Mount Westwood station near Broken Hill and Koonaburra station near Ivanhoe to land that will be protected for conservation.\nThe acquisitions have marked the reversal of a trend that the head of the National Parks Association of NSW, Gary Dunnett, says saw the establishment and expansion of reserves come to an \u201cabrupt end\u201d after the Coalition won power in NSW.\nIt\u2019s a move that has seen Kean praised by the environment movement, though Dunnett adds it must come with adequate resources for environmental management.\nLegislation introduced by Kean to the NSW parliament this week proposing substantial changes to laws that govern national parks has also raised alarm bells from the NSW opposition, crossbench and the conservation movement.\n\u201cBecause we\u2019ve had this long hiatus, we\u2019ve got a national parks service that\u2019s gone through efficiency dividends in that time. So from our perspective, they\u2019re starting from a low point,\u201d Dunnett says.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really important that these new lands come with resourcing packages and it is notable that none of the press releases to date have actually talked about that component.\u201d\nSince becoming environment minister, Kean has targeted national parks for much of the biodiversity work required of the portfolio.\nConservation protections on other types of land tenure have been a source of division within the government, most notoriously with the \u201ckoala wars\u201d that nearly split the Coalition in 2020.\nKean initially set a target to add 200,000 hectares to the state\u2019s conservation estate but doubled it to 400,000 by 2022 after reaching that figure almost a year early.\nThe state has now added more than 500,000 hectares for protection since August 2019, which Dunnett says brings NSW closer to its historical average of about one million hectares a decade.\nMost of the new acquisitions have occurred in the state\u2019s west, a region with unique ecosystems and species that are under-represented in the conservation network.\nAbout 9% of land in NSW sits inside protected areas. West of the Great Dividing Range the figure was closer to 3% before the new acquisitions.\n\u201cThey seem to have done a really good job of picking places that bring the best benefit from a biodiversity perspective,\u201d Dunnett says.\nPepe Clarke, the deputy director of conservation organisation the Pew Charitable Trusts, says the scale of the recent investments is welcome, and hopes it is a signal there will be greater investment in the management of parks in the years ahead.\n\u201cOutback Australia is one of the last remaining intact natural places on earth, but much of our unique wildlife and iconic landscapes remain threatened or vulnerable,\u201d he says.\n\u201cIn NSW, once you get west of the Great Dividing Range, wildlife habitat is woefully under-protected. Without greater active management and increased protection, many native species will continue to decline.\u201d\nClarke says to fulfil their potential, the properties will need to be managed with \u201cboots on the ground\u201d and, once livestock is removed, through work to address key threats, including noxious weeds and feral pests, particularly goats.\nThe NSW government has said little to date about how the new parks will be managed and resourced, with plans for each in development.\nWhen the Narriearra acquisition was announced last year, WWF-Australia called on the government to make sure the new park created jobs for traditional owners who should be able to use the site and be central to the conservation of cultural areas and artefacts.\nRocky Robertson, the chief executive of the Tibooburra Local Aboriginal Land Council, told Guardian Australia that since that time the council and other Aboriginal people with ties to the land had had \u201ca lot of involvement in the setting up of the new site\u201d.\nIn terms of resources, the government says the number of full-time equivalent staff across the entire national parks and wildlife service is 2,014, up from 1,633 in 2019.\nIt says it is making the biggest investment \u2013 about $450m up to 2022-23 \u2013 in visitor infrastructure in NSW national park history and will under take the largest feral animal control program to occur across the reserve system.\nFor the Narriearra Caryapundy Swamp national park and the Langidoon and Metford and Koonaburra sites, the government says there will be a total of six new positions added to existing parks teams.\nIt says about $750,000 additional capital and operating expenditure has already occurred for these sites, on top of $1m spent on establishing a camp ground, roads and cultural heritage surveys and biodiversity surveys at Narriearra.\nDunnett says the extra capital expenditure is welcome but there is \u201cno information upon which to base any judgment of the adequacy of this allocation\u201d.\nAnd he says the additional six staff roles represent just 0.3% of the total parks workforce, which falls short of a proportionate increase to staffing levels when the area of protected land in NSW has increased by 7.35%.\nA government proposal to use national parks to create credits to sell in the state\u2019s biodiversity offset market also prompted major concern and accusations of \u201cstatewide greenwashing\u201d last week when it was introduced as part of a bill presented to the NSW parliament without consultation.\nLabor and the crossbench have said they will oppose the legislation in its current form, despite welcoming aspects of the bill, including necessary changes to laws to expand the Gardens of Stone national park in the Blue Mountains.\nBev Smiles, the vice-president of the Central West Environment Council, says the interest now will be in how the government deals with the environmental issues at each of the new parks and how it uses parks management to improve employment opportunities for local residents.\n\u201cI\u2019ve always advocated and there\u2019s a real opportunity to have more local employment from natural resource management,\u201d she says.\n \nEmail:\u00a0sign up for our\u00a0daily morning and afternoon email newsletters\nApp:\u00a0download our free app\u00a0and never miss the biggest stories\nSocial:\u00a0follow us on YouTube,\u00a0TikTok,\u00a0Instagram,\u00a0Facebook\u00a0or\u00a0Twitter\nPodcast:\u00a0listen to our daily episodes on\u00a0Apple Podcasts,\u00a0Spotify\u00a0or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app\n\u201cOur natural capital is something that needs to be invested in.\n\u201cIf that investment includes jobs through the local land service and national parks and wildlife service and employing rangers and local young people then it\u2019s a really good outcome for everybody.\u201d\nSmiles adds it would be possible to find threatened species on just about every piece of land out west.\nShe says given the size of the new sites, once they are destocked and managed for conservation \u201cthere would actually be quite a bit of bounce-back\u201d.\nSimon Molesworth is an environmental QC, pastoralist and the head of Landcare Broken Hill.\nHe says the acquisition of the new sites has not been welcomed by the whole community, with some agricultural land owners concerned about what they see as growing competition for property.\n\u201cWhat they\u2019re saying is the government can outbid anyone and take these properties out of circulation,\u201d Molesworth says.\n\u201cBut for the viability of rural Australia we need to have balance. If every property is producing, you then don\u2019t have what I call the green lungs next door.\u201d\nMolesworth himself has seen the degree of ecological bounce-back that can occur, having destocked his own properties three years ago to manage them for conservation.\nHe says saltbushes, native grasses and low-lying shrubs have \u201ccome back magnificently\u201d, even with minimal rain.\n\u201cMy view is you need to adopt the long-term perspective,\u201d he says. \u201cThe climate is changing and it is responsible for governments to acquire large areas of land to become biodiversity and carbon sinks.\n\u201cWe do have to safeguard the biodiversity of the far west. I can observe that those that did destock, it\u2019s extraordinary the degree of bounce-back.\u201d",

People have realised city life isn\u2019t always that great,\u201d Boag says. \u201cThe air is fresh and the sea is clean here. It\u2019s what makes life so good.\u201d\nJudging by the developers eyeing off the area and tourists looking to escape down the highway from Sydney at weekends, Boag says it seems as though the rest of the world has come to the same conclusion.\nBut Boag and other locals are increasingly concerned about plans to open up the Jervis Bay marine park \u2013 one of just five in New South Wales \u2013 to the cruise ship industry.\n\u201cI can\u2019t see any positives to be honest. The only thing is that business owners might make more money,\u201d Boag says. \u201cThe health of our marine ecosystem is what sustains us all. There\u2019s nothing environmentally safe about cruise ships.\u201d\nAfter a two-year hiatus and the hit to its reputation from the Ruby Princess fiasco, Australia\u2019s $5.2bn cruise industry is itching to get back on the water.\nIndustry figures met the NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard, in early November to talk about what it would take.\nThe industry had hoped to have a new season under way by now, but it has been a patchy start, with large operators such as P&O Australia cancelling cruises due for 2022 due to a lack of certainty about government permission to operate.\nBut the desire to get back to business is reviving tensions between the industry and communities living near current or proposed destinations over environmental concerns. They say the two-year break should have been used to resolve outstanding issues.\nIn Queensland, a contentious proposal for a new cruise ship terminal on the Gold Coast has been refloated, while residents in Sydney\u2019s Yarra Bay have been working to stop a new terminal being built there.\nPenny Davidson from the Jervis Bay Community Cruiseship Coalition says questions have gone unanswered by the NSW government, who she says has handled the issue in a confusing and opaque way.\nThe Port Authority of NSW has repeatedly denied it has plans to open up the marine park to cruise ships, but a draft NSW mainland marine park management plan names Jervis Bay in plans by the Department of Primary Industries to boost cruise tourism in regional areas.\nMeanwhile cruise companies have been selling tickets that include Jervis Bay on the itinerary \u2013 raising fears that decisions have been made behind closed doors.\n\u201cOur worry is that once you introduce this for one, you won\u2019t be able to say no to others,\u201d Davidson says. \u201cGiven our fragile environment, have they done the studies to show current levels of use aren\u2019t already harming our ecosystem without adding more pressure?\u201d\nA spokesperson for the Port Authority of NSW said the agency had taken over management of minor ports in Jervis Bay in 2018 and had \u201cinherited a situation\u201d where cruise ships were given permission by the Marine Park Authority to stay overnight in the area.\nThey said Jervis Bay was not being considered as a cruise destination after discussions with the Shoalhaven city council and the authority was taking this consultation in future decisions.\nThe Department of Primary Industries was contacted for comment.\nProf Susanne Becken, who teaches sustainable tourism at Griffith University, says the situation faced by Jervis Bay and other communities is a \u201cvery familiar\u201d story.\nFrom Vanuatu to Canada\u2019s Northwest Passage, the pressure to open up new areas to the cruise industry is relentless, but decisions are often made without detailed independent research on economic benefits or environmental impact, she says.\n\u201cNobody really knows how much economic benefit the industry brings in and nobody really knows about how much pollution they are responsible for,\u201d Becken says.\n\u201cIf you put in a new road you have a very comprehensive cost-benefit analysis and community consultation. The need for independent data is really important here.\u201d\nThe pollution the industry generates is not to be underestimated. As floating hotels that carry hundreds of people at a time into some of the world\u2019s most pristine and fragile ecosystems, cruise ships generate an average \u200b\u200b2,358m\u00b3 of greywater and treated sewage, 84m\u00b3 of oily waste, and 266m\u00b3 of solid waste a week, under normal conditions.\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nAnd from the moment a passenger steps aboard a cruise ship, their carbon footprint triples thanks to the \u201cbunker fuel\u201d the ships burn. Bunker fuel is a low-quality fuel made from the dregs of the oil-refining process, and is hazardous to human health.\nBefore global efforts to reduce the amount of sulfur in this fuel took effect in 2020, bunker fuel was thought responsible for 400,000 deaths worldwide from lung cancer and 14m cases of asthma. Even with the new regulations, the fuel is expected to cause 250,000 deaths a year.\nBecken says the \u201clatent risks\u201d also include the potential for spills both accidental and deliberate.\nIn 2016 a Carnival Cruise subsidiary was handed a $40m fine when it was found crews aboard its ships in the UK and US used a make-shift bypass known in the industry as the \u201cmagic pipe\u201d to dump thousands of litres of untreated oily water into the ocean.\nCoupled with the physical impact from anchors ripping up the seafloor, noise pollution from increased naval traffic and the cumulative pressure from the construction of support infrastructure such as piers or bus terminals, cruise shipping can be a dirty business.\nThe industry says it is working to improve. A spokesperson for Cruise Lines International Association said its ocean-going members had committed to pursue \u201cnet carbon neutral cruising by 2050\u201d and was supporting research efforts to develop zero emissions fuels.\nThe spokesperson said the industry in Australia was covered by multiple levels of state and federal regulation that \u201cincludes strict measures covering discharges such as wastewater and ballast\u201d.\nThey said Australia had adopted global regulations know as \u201cMarpol\u201d aimed at improving the quality of maritime fuel, and cited the industry body\u2019s waste management policy that \u201cprohibits the discharge of untreated sewage at sea, anytime, anywhere, around the globe\u201d.\nThough the industry and government point to these regulations to soothe concerns, others in affected communities say they are wide enough to drive a cruise ship through.\nKate Horrobin is among residents living near the White Bay cruise terminal in Sydney, who have been working to get authorities to address health and environmental concerns since it opened in 2013.\nAround that time, she says, residents began to compare notes about headaches and asthma attacks, which they came to believe were linked to inhaling exhaust from cruise ships idling at the terminal.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll hear people say our problems have been solved because of the Marpol regulations, but they are intended as a standard when floating way out at sea,\u201d Horrobin says. \u201cYou can still come right into Sydney Harbour burning 0.5% sulfur fuel. We need that to come down to 0.1%.\u201d\nHorrobin says the industry may be raring to go after the pandemic, but for her it\u2019s been a \u201clovely holiday\u201d and a \u201ccomplete relief\u201d from cruise ship pollution.\nShe wants the NSW government to build \u201cshore to ship power\u201d so that cruise ships can switch off their engines while in port.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a do-no harm policy,\u201d Horrobin says. \u201cOur attitude is: come back, but in coming back you need to adhere to the world\u2019s best standards, not the world\u2019s worst. And you must protect the health and environment of communities you\u2019re pulling up alongside.\u201d",

The FA is now facing calls for an urgent inquiry.\nTony Burnett, chief executive of the anti-racism charity Kick It Out, said: \u201cThe lack of diversity in refereeing is our biggest failure in football. Black and Asian people are not getting through to elite refereeing.\u201d\nAn investigation by the Observer reveals:\nA report presented to the FA highlights allegations of racism among observers who mark referees for promotion. One observer is alleged to have told one referee: \u201cYou lot can all run fast, but that\u2019s all you are good for.\u201d\nThe lower levels of the refereeing system have been dubbed by some referees from ethnic minorities the \u201cblack man\u2019s graveyard\u201d because of allegations they are blocked by a small number of white assessors from reaching the highest levels.\nThere are no black or Asian referees officiating in the Premier League or Championship. There are just four referees from ethnic minorities officiating in the country\u2019s top seven divisions.\nThe FA\u2019s 14-member referee committee, which has the task of improving diversity in the 24,500-strong referee workforce has no black or Asian representatives.\nA 2015 FA report on diversity in refereeing, Widening the Net, set a target of 10% of its referee workforce being from ethnic minorities. The FA says ethnic minorities among referees has risen from about 4% in 2015 to about 8%.\nJoel Mannix, chair of the Black, Asian and Mixed Heritage Ethnicity (BAME) Referee Support Group and one of the highest-ranked black referees in the country, said: \u201cYou\u2019ve got observers who are racist and they are marking down officials on their colour.\u201d He said reforms need to focus on representation, recruitment and retention.\nThe group submitted a diversity report last year to the FA that detailed alleged racist comments by observers. It compiled the report from referees from ethnic minorities to show the racial discrimination faced out by some referees. The report set out a road plan for reform. The BAME Referee Support Group now wants the FA to publish a detailed breakdown of the number of referees from ethnic minorities officiating across the various divisions.\nThe Observer understands that referees have also compiled evidence on one observer, including video footage seen by the newspaper, who is alleged to have made racist comments.\nFA officials said that they did not comment on individual allegations, but would \u201cinvestigate all alleged incidents of discrimination\u201d. An analysis of FA figures has also found the official diversity figures cited by officials are of limited use because they are inflated by including white Polish and Irish referees as minority ethnic groups. The FA confirmed last week that all referees who were not from \u201cwhite British backgrounds\u2019 were recorded in the ethnic minority figures.\nThere are about 24,500 referees in England, most of whom officiate amateur Sunday league football. While amateur referees may get as little as \u00a325 a match, the professional referees can earn more than \u00a3100,000.\nCampaigners say while the football world will next year be celebrating the 150th anniversary of the FA Cup, it will also be a reminder that in its history no black or Asian referee has ever officiated at the tournament\u2019s final.\nThe FA said an equality working group is working on recommendations on the recruitment, retention, support and development of referees from all backgrounds. It is also updating its diversity figures and was unable to provide any detailed breakdown of its current figures.\nA spokesperson said: \u201cWe remain committed to ensuring the diversity of those playing, coaching, officiating and leading English football is truly reflective of our modern society. As part of this, within the 2018-2021 national game strategy we set inclusion targets across the game for the first time.\u201d",

        "content": "FA under pressure to launch inquiry into why BAME officials flourish at grassroots but fail to break into game\u2019s highest levels\nLiverpool\u2019s 2-0 victory over Tottenham under bright blue skies at White Hart Lane on 11 May 2008 was described by the sports writers at the time as a lacklustre affair.\nBut it has turned out to be a historic fixture: it was the last time a black referee officiated in England\u2019s top league.\nIt was hoped Uriah Rennie, the Premier League\u2019s first black referee, would be the trailblazer for a new generation of minority ethnic referees.\nInstead, the business administration and law graduate, who refereed more than 170 Premier League matches, proved to be an outlier.\nWhile its footballers take the knee each week in a gesture to support anti-racism, no black or Asian referee has officiated a Premier League match for more than a decade.\nThere are 40 referees on the books for the 2021-22 season in the Premier League and the Championship. They are all white. Out of a workforce of about 200 referees over the country\u2019s top seven divisions, just four (2%) are black or Asian: Sam Allison, Joel Mannix, Aji Ajibola and Sunny Gill.\nThere are approximately 24,500 referees in England, most of whom officiate amateur Sunday league football, and the Football Association (FA) claimed last week that about 2,000 (8.2%) are minority ethnic. So why are they failing to break into the country\u2019s two highest divisions?\nTop minority ethnic referees say the answer lies in a refereeing report on diversity submitted to the FA in the summer of last year.\nThe 53-page report, compiled by the Black, Asian and Mixed Ethnicity Referee Support Group, alleges that some of the FA observers who assess referees for promotion to the higher leagues are racist.\nAccording to the report, one observer is alleged to have told a referee: \u201cYou lot can all run fast, but that\u2019s all you are good for.\u201d Another is claimed to have said: \u201cIf you want to progress, you need to cut your dreadlocks.\u201d Another made an offensive comment about throwing a banana.\nThe FA this weekend faces calls for an inquiry into its referee programme and allegations of racism; more transparency over its diversity policies; and an audit of the appointment system for referees.\nReuben Simon, 49, from Hanworth, west London, who was a referee in southern England between 2005 and 2015, said he was initially baffled at why the significant number of black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) referees officiating in the lower leagues were not climbing the ranks as quickly as white officials. He concluded that racism and unconscious bias were blocking them.\nSimon said: \u201cThere are lots of black referees at the grassroots level, but they are not getting through the system. It\u2019s possible that every single black referee is rubbish, but if that\u2019s absurd, what\u2019s the other conclusion? They are being blocked because of racial bias.\n\u201cNot every observer is racially biased, but the margins are so small the higher you go up the system that if just one person marks you down it\u2019s game over.\u201d\nSimon said he told a senior FA official in 2011 that regular and transparent audits of observers, including the use of \u201cghost observers\u201d to shadow official assessors, would tackle the issue of racism and unconscious bias. The proposal was not taken up.\nMost referees are classified on an ascending scale from level seven to level one, with annual opportunities for promotion. The elite referees in the Premier League and the Championship are in two higher groups: select group one and select group two.\nThe assessments for appointment to the next level are based on reports by FA observers and input from football clubs.\nLevel 1 and the two select groups are overseen by Professional Game Match Officials Ltd (PGMOL), a company partly controlled by the FA and Premier League; levels 2 to 4 are overseen by the FA; and levels 5 and below are overseen by county FAs. A referee in the lower division will typically earn between \u00a325 and \u00a340 a match, while a professional referee in the Premier League can earn more than \u00a3100,000 a year.\nMannix, who chairs the BAME support group and is a level-2 referee, said: \u201cLevels 3 and 4 are known as the \u2018black man\u2019s graveyard\u2019 because you\u2019ve got observers who are racist and they are marking down officials on their colour.\u201d He said the observers were mostly \u201cold, white males\u201d.\nThe frustration is compounded by the fact that the FA\u2019s 14-strong referee committee overseeing the diversity initiatives has no black, Asian or mixed heritage members. It is headed by David Elleray, a former referee who was sanctioned by the FA in 2014 after allegedly making racist comments to another official.\nMannix said the FA was keen to address the diversity issue, but was not implementing the fundamental changes required. He recounted how, during one diversity meeting, a senior FA official had suggested that additional black referees could be recruited from among people leaving prison.\n\u201cIt was incredibly insulting,\u201d Mannix said.\nTony Burnett, chief executive of the anti-racism charity Kick It Out, said: \u201cBlack and Asian referees are not getting through to elite refereeing and it suggests a systemic problem. We need a review so we can understand the numbers and home in on the problem. It will not be a quick fix. This is going to take years.\u201d\nThe FA\u2019s official diversity figures are of limited use because they have been boosted by counting white Irish and white Polish referees as ethnic minorities.\nAny referees \u201cnot from white British backgrounds\u201d were included in the minority ethnic figures, the FA told the Observer. It has now launched a review and update of the data.\nAny allegation of discrimination would be taken extremely seriously, the FA said. Unconscious bias training has been delivered for referees, coaches and observers operating throughout the professional game and national leagues.\nAn FA spokesperson said: \u201cWe want to grow the pipeline of a high-performing refereeing workforce across both grassroots and elite football, which is representative of females, black, Asian, mixed or other ethnic groups and disabled people.\u201d\nMike Riley, managing director of PGMOL, said: \u201cWe believe there should be no barriers to entry or opportunity in football. We have established an inclusion advisory group to focus on creating and implementing initiatives to address under-representation, as well as reviewing our existing practices and policies.\u201d",

        "content": "The Springboks fought hard but were unable to dominate the contest in the way they did two years ago in the World Cup final\nSo much of the buildup this week recalled the events of 2 November 2019 in Yokohama. Back then, the Springbok pack scrummed England off the park, laying an indomitable foundation from which they controlled the game. When England\u2019s backs got a sniff of the ball the South Africa defenders held the line like Spartans at Thermopylae.\nFor the first 20 minutes of Saturday\u2019s contest the opposite was true. England\u2019s outside backs regularly outmanoeuvred the Springbok rush defence, scoring tries in either corner by sucking in the peripheral wing. Kyle Sinckler, so cruelly injured in the opening exchanges of the World Cup final, helped win two penalties from the first two scrums. After taking a 14-3 lead, memories of Ellis Park 2018 and England\u2019s 24-3 advantage came to mind.\nHowever, that match finished with a 42-39 Springbok win. Ever since they have carved a reputation as a team that won\u2019t go away. A strong bench helps, but there is an apocryphal notion that South Africans perform at their best when the odds are against them.\nMatches against England in the self-aggrandising \u201cHome of Rugby\u201d hardly need any additional impetus, but the apparent World Rugby awards snub this week and the punishment of Rassie Erasmus meant there were a few scores to settle and not just against Eddie Jones\u2019 charges. Now with an early deficit to overcome, those old Springbok virtues were needed.\nMomentum shifted when Handr\u00e9 Pollard nailed a 50-metre penalty on the angle near the right touchline on 27 minutes. Three minutes later he squeezed another through the posts from the left. England would frequently visit South African territory, courtesy of a dominant kicking game, but they lacked the same cutting edge. The Boks scrum landed some blows of its own. Ox Nch\u00e9 flattened Bevan Rodd. Duane Vermeulen and Damian de Allende began to boss their channels. South Africa went into the half-time break behind by five points but well in the scrap.\nAfter establishing themselves as the darlings of the rugby world two years ago, Siya Kolisi\u2019s team have become a lightning rod for a lot of nasty rhetoric. Much of that is the result of a jingoistic cabal within the South African press corps and the teams\u2019 frothing fanbase. There is also no denying legitimate concerns over one-eyed reports from afar. Scoff all you like, but barbs from the UK still sting.\nIn the second half, the Springbok scrum, restocked by a fresh front row four minutes in, gained the upper hand which also saw the maul grab the ascendancy. Eben Etzebeth, whose personal battle with Maro Itoje deserved its own highlight reel, was immense, marauding through holes and hammering English carriers. His two steals on defensive lineouts after Kolisi was sin-binned looked to be decisive acts of heroism.\nThat he would end up a loser on the night is the result of two breakdown penalties won by the home side \u2013 one within Marcus Smith\u2019s range and the other inside their own 22 with the finish in sight.\nFor the second consecutive visit to London, South Africa lost by a single point. That will hurt, particularly given how well they stormed back into the fight. But legitimate questions will be asked about the way they began. That is now seven games and counting that they have been behind at half-time. Against this England team, who are unbeaten in the past 22 matches in which they have been ahead at half-time, this proved the difference.\nIt has been a strange season for the world champions. Last time they were here they left with a sense of optimism regarding what was to come. Erasmus had yet to devise the \u201cBomb Squad\u201d tactic, the Chasing the Sun documentary had yet to yank tears from a million eyes, a glorious future lay in wait. Now they leave the UK with yet another reason to feel aggrieved and prove the doubters wrong.",

But mainly it is because of Spurs. \u201cToday is 17 November,\u201d the manager continues. \u201cAnd in two days, it is the anniversary. The two years since we left Tottenham. It\u2019s in my mind, no?\u201d\nPochettino truly is the most gloriously soppy of former Argentina centre-halves and this is what a breakup looks like \u2013 the regret, the sudden pangs \u2013 even if he says that he is doing better these days, he is moving on. \u201cWhen I watch the games now, it\u2019s always with a smile and trying to support them because when you love a club and you feel at home, always you wish the best for the people that you know,\u201d he says.\nOne of them is Harry Kane who, if things had worked out differently over the summer, would have been lining up for City at the Etihad Stadium against Pochettino. \u201cI love Tottenham fans and I love Tottenham and I am so happy that Harry is in Tottenham,\u201d Pochettino says. \u201cBut I want the best for Harry and I want the best for Tottenham. That\u2019s it, no?\u201d\nIf feels like the moment to ask Pochettino whether, if things had worked out differently for him over the summer, he might have found himself back at Spurs. It was Steve Hitchen, the technical performance director and Pochettino\u2019s close friend, who had explored whether the sensational reunion could happen as the club cast the net for a permanent successor to Jos\u00e9 Mourinho.\nPochettino said nothing at the time in late May, which went down badly in Paris, and he is keen to explain the stance. In short, Pochettino did not drive the story so why was he going to comment on it? \u201cYou never know from where these rumours appear and I am a person who doesn\u2019t like to take advantage of these things,\u201d Pochettino says.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I didn\u2019t talk. The people criticised me here in France, the media \u2026 \u2018Why doesn\u2019t Mauricio give his word about staying in Paris?\u2019 But when you don\u2019t create things, why am I going to say something? I don\u2019t need to clarify things. Of course, I listened to everything. But, yes \u2026 never happened, that.\u201d\nDid Pochettino not end up extending his PSG contract? \u201cNo, we didn\u2019t extend,\u201d he replies. \u201cWhen I signed in January, it was one and a half years plus the option of one more. The club activated the option and now it\u2019s this season plus one.\u201d\nWas it to discourage Spurs? \u201cHaha, maybe,\u201d Pochettino says. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t ask the president and I didn\u2019t ask Leonardo [the sporting director]. Maybe it was that\u201d\nPochettino will never lose his sense of mischief, his joie de vivre, but it feels as though it has been tested during his 10 and a half months in Paris, where he continues to live in a hotel. His wife, Karina, younger son, Maurizio \u2013 who is on Watford\u2019s books \u2013 and beloved dog, Sansa, remain in London and it is a long way from being ideal for such a family-oriented man, although his older son, Sebastiano, is with him at PSG where he is the fitness coach.\n\u201cThe situation is a little bit strange,\u201d Pochettino says. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy but we\u2019ll see what will happen \u2013 if I can find some apartment or house then I will move soon. With coronavirus and the lockdown, it was difficult to find a house and the right house. But I\u2019m OK. I\u2019m not in a bad place. I\u2019m in a good place. The good thing is that I\u2019ve found very nice people in the hotel. Now we are like a family. It\u2019s unbelievable how all the staff treat me.\u201d\nPochettino must deal with suffocating levels of expectation, with PSG required not only to win every match but to do so in style. \u201cThis season is massive and all the people believe that we should be winning the games before we play \u2013 after one minute, if you have not scored three, four or five goals, the disappointment is massive,\u201d Pochettino says, without the hint of a smile.\nPSG are well clear at the top of Ligue 1 while they trail City by one point after four Champions League games, with a four-point cushion to Club Brugge in third. But the football has sometimes been unconvincing, lacking in beauty and thrills, and the criticism has been remorseless. It is put to Pochettino that no matter what he does, it can never be enough. \u201cNo, exactly,\u201d he says. \u201cThat is the feeling. But that is good because we are living a very good experience. It is an amazing experience.\u201d\nIt is probably Lionel Messi\u2019s fault because, with him arriving in August to supplement Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 and Neymar up front, rival defences ought to be little more than quivering wrecks. Plainly, it is not that simple, with none of the trio appearing to suit Pochettino\u2019s fast-pressing style or to be overly bothered about tracking back. Balancing the team is a fiendishly difficult task, although does anybody want to hear that?\n\u201cEach of the three can be the king of any club in the world,\u201d Pochetttino says. \u201cBut you have three kings in the same club, three with different needs and who need different things from the team. Mbapp\u00e9 needs space to run and high tempo in the transition. Neymar needs to have the ball and feel the ball, and sometimes he needs to drive the ball. And Messi needs maybe another tempo in the game. That is not easy to put all together.\n\u201cWe\u2019re working to find the right way to play in which Mbapp\u00e9 feels comfortable, Neymar and Messi feel comfortable and then the rest of the team understand that sometimes we need to increase the tempo and sometimes we can play on the space, sometimes we need to play more horizontal and build in the slow possession. It\u2019s not an easy task but it\u2019s an amazing challenge which we are enjoying, a beautiful time to have the possibility to work with these amazing players.\u201d\nWhat Pochettino seemingly must do is win the Champions League, because regaining the domestic title and retaining the French Cup is not enough. If he did not deliver the biggest prize, the one that the club\u2019s Qatari owners have craved since their takeover in 2011, he would most likely be branded a failure and he knows it.\n\u201cI agree,\u201d Pochettino says. \u201cThe feeling is about winning the Champions League and, if not, you will feel that you have failed. For sure. The people translate that feeling.\u201d\nPochettino is not blind to the realities of life at PSG. He signed with his eyes wide open to them. \u201cIt\u2019s all about winning,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s completely different to another project. When I accepted the job, I knew that if you play well and you don\u2019t win, there\u2019s nothing to do.\u201d\nAnd yet Pochettino continues to push a more layered take, his own reality, in which time to adapt and build are recurring themes. If they apply to the collective, then they must do so on an individual level for Messi, who has previously known only life at Barcelona for so many years.\n\u201cWe hope that we have the time to develop in the way that we want to play,\u201d Pochettino says. \u201cIt\u2019s only with time and commitment. If we have the capacity to create this commitment, all together, I think it\u2019s going to be an amazing journey. If all the players are committed to the project then, for sure, we are going to be close to winning the Champions League. That\u2019s the job we are doing now \u2013 to work, to convince and to make that happen.\n\u201cThe easiest thing for us would have been to wait for another project, a normal project, with no pressure and to build something long-term. But we are brave and we love the challenge. It makes us grow. We are enjoying this period but we know that the line is so thin. You can be over the moon one day and, the day after, you can be at the bottom. That is how these types of clubs live.\u201d",

The Premier League has many problems and causes many problems, and for the vast majority of young players perhaps it is difficult to secure game time.

Imagine you are picking the squad for next year\u2019s World Cup. Assuming the 3-4-2-1 Gareth Southgate fielded against Albania and San Marino is the default, there are perhaps five spaces available for the two inside-forward roles to operate either side of Harry Kane \u2013 which, along with right-back, is the area of real strength.\nWhen was the last time that was true? English football has traditionally produced centre-backs and centre-forwards, hard-grafting midfielders and reliable goalkeepers. It has not really done position-defying craft and creativity.\nRaheem Sterling is the man in possession, and was probably England\u2019s best attacking player at the Euros. Mason Mount is loved by coaches for his tactical intelligence. Then there\u2019s Jack Grealish, Bukayo Saka, Emile Smith Rowe, Marcus Rashford, Mason Greenwood, Callum Hudson-Odoi and Jadon Sancho, none of them older than 26. But it feels increasingly as though this season may be witnessing the emergence of the greatest of them all: Phil Foden.\nThe fretting over whether he was getting enough pitch time is ebbing. Pep Guardiola\u2019s panegyrics to his ability sound increasingly sincere. The excitement at an emerging talent and the lust to see him as often as possible shouldn\u2019t occlude the desirability of patience, of the benefits of letting him develop at his own pace.\nGuardiola may turn out to have got it just right; certainly it\u2019s easy to see his influence on the player Foden is becoming. Discomfort at where the money comes from is reasonable, and there probably should be a moral reckoning: English football undoubtedly benefits from the fact the Premier League can afford to recruit the best coaches in the world.\nIt\u2019s not only Foden\u2019s poise and vision, his 87.6% pass completion rate and average of 1.4 key passes a game, his work rate and his positioning: it\u2019s his versatility. He may have scored only three goals this season and registered one assist (although in six league starts, that\u2019s a perfectly reasonable strike rate), and he may not top any charts for chance creation or for dispossessing opponents, but that\u2019s largely because his range has been so varied. This season, he has been used in at least five different roles.\nRole A: Chelsea 0 Manchester City 1, Premier League, 25 September 2021. City set up, as so often, in a 4-3-3, with Foden the central forward between Gabriel Jesus and Grealish. His role was very much as a false 9. He had only 32 touches in the game and didn\u2019t register a shot, but made 27 pressures and was a key factor in the way City smothered Chelsea \u2013 although he also created four shooting opportunities. This was the centre-forward as midfielder.\nRole B: Liverpool 2 Manchester City 2, Premier League, 3 October 2021. That James Milner, usually such an unflappable emblem of calm efficiency, should have been fortunate not to be sent off said everything about how Foden, playing on the left of a front three, tormented him. He went past him on the inside, he went past him on the outside, and he effectively neutralised Liverpool\u2019s right-back as an attacking threat by constantly hitting the space behind him. His goal capped a complete performance that included 19 pressures and 30 carries, seven of them of more than five metres.\nRole C: Andorra 0 England 5, World Cup qualifier, 9 October 2021. England started in a 4-3-3, with Foden not as one of the three forwards but on the left side of midfield, sitting deep and measuring passes into the narrow space behind the Andorra defence, a ploy that was undeniably effective.\nAgainst better opposition, perhaps Foden would be less successful in that more withdrawn role, his creative instincts compromised by the hurly-burly, but against a deep-lying defence his ability to calibrate a pass was hugely important.\nRole D: Brighton 1 Manchester City 4, Premier League, 23 October 2021. Foden played in the middle of a front three and while there were occasions on which he dropped deep, he operated almost as an orthodox centre-forward, harrying the Brighton defence and scoring twice. It helped that Brighton played with a high line, but he repeatedly made dangerous runs in behind. He had eight shots in that game, four of them on target.\nRole E: England 5 Albania 0, World Cup qualifier, 12 November 2021. Foden started as the right-sided forward in a 3-4-3 and linked well with Reece James as England pulled Albania apart before half-time, transforming what could have been an awkward game into a stroll.\nIt was his corner that brought the fifth goal, but more significant was the intelligence of his movement and passing, the way he kept the ball moving, never letting Albania settle. At the Euros he had looked out of sorts on the right but here, and then in the first half against San Marino, he was running games from that flank.\n\u201cI like Phil for the fact he knows how to play football,\u201d Guardiola has said. \u201cWe can have an extra man in the positions we want to play, to pass the ball you have in certain areas to have more players.\u201d That sort of positional intelligence and ability to improvise within a defined framework has traditionally been rare in English players.\nAnd that, perhaps, is the most significant detail. It\u2019s not only that Foden is technically gifted and works hard; it\u2019s that he is tactically smart as well. And that intelligence, with the guidance of Guardiola, means it looks as though he could be very special indeed.",

        "content": "Marcus Smith paid tribute to England\u2019s World Cup-winning fly-half Jonny Wilkinson after his last-minute penalty clinched a famous one-point win over South Africa in fairytale fashion. Smith was given a masterclass in training by Wilkinson this week before going on to nail the 80th-minute kick to steer England to a dramatic 27-26 victory, avenging the 2019 World Cup final defeat.\nSmith, 22, was making only his fourth England start and Jones has tipped the mercurial fly-half for big things, provided he doesn\u2019t get \u201ctoo much poison poured into his head\u201d. It was a statement that echoed Jones\u2019s recent warning about the pitfalls of fame, using the example of Emma Raducanu to do so.\nSmith finished the match with 12 points, assuming kicking duties with Owen Farrell sidelined after ankle surgery. He revealed that the captain has been in regular contact this week but reserved special praise for Wilkinson, who has worked on consultancy basis with England in the past and made his first trip of the autumn into camp on Wednesday.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all down to him,\u201d said Smith. \u201cHe\u2019s been working hard with me and, again, putting his arm around me and allowing me to explore at the weekend. I appreciated it, big time. We said four weeks ago this was the game we wanted to target. The boys bought into the last four weeks. We got extremely close as a group. It was a massive, massive part of our journey as a young group of players and to beat the world champions in front of 82,000 at home was special. It\u2019s a day I\u2019ll never forget.\n\u201cI hit the kick and it was like slow-motion watching it sail through the posts. But we still had a job to do retrieving that kick-off. To win the penalty and properly celebrate at the end was amazing. This group will never forget that day.\u201d\nWith Farrell a fitness doubt for the start of the Six Nations Smith is set to continue in his role as the spearhead of England\u2019s attack when they return to the field at Scotland next February.\nJones said: \u201cLook, he\u2019s going to be good, mate. As long as you blokes don\u2019t pour too much poison in his head. He\u2019s a work in progress and each game he\u2019s going to get a little bit better. I thought he did a great job but I know he\u2019s going to be better in the Six Nations.\u201d\nIn a thrilling finish Smith\u2019s kick was the fourth time the lead changed hands in the final quarter, with South Africa coming back strongly in the second half. Jones conceded that England were \u201cat breaking point\u201d and finished the match with 18 penalties against them, but he heralded his side\u2019s resilience after selecting the rookies Bevan Rodd and Jamie Blamire in his front row and losing Manu Tuilagi to injury in the eighth minute.\n\u201cTwenty minutes into the second half I thought we were almost at breaking point,\u201d added Jones. \u201cThey were squeezing us at the scrum, winning more than their 50-50 of high balls and starting to get a little bit more out of their attack. We got away a bit in the first half but we knew they\u2019d come back. They tend to win the second half and we just managed to hang in there, absorb the punishment and when we got the opportunity we managed to take it. As I said before the game, it\u2019s a one-off between the first in the world and the third in the world and we\u2019re happy to knock off the top team in the world.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an important win but our stated aim is to win the World Cup. It gives the players a lot of confidence. They\u2019ve worked hard, enjoyed each other\u2019s company and when they come into Six Nations they\u2019ll have a spring in their step. We\u2019ve never been bad. We had a bad Six Nations but we\u2019re not a bad team. We had a tough period where we didn\u2019t play well and we got a bit stale. We\u2019ve refreshed ourselves now and we\u2019ll go forward.\u201d\nSouth Africa\u2019s head coach, Jacques Nienaber, was magnanimous in defeat, reflecting on how the last time the Springboks visited Twickenham they were also beaten by a solitary point in another nerve-shredding finish. \u201cAll week we spoke about how [England] are a quality team,\u201d said Nienaber. \u201cThey had [eight] players from the World Cup final, we had 10 so there are a lot of similarities. They played well and they gave a proper Test match for their home fans.\u201d",

Joel Keys left the committee chair, Tory MP Simon Hoare, \u201cchilled and appalled\u201d and he faced a media backlash.\nSix months on Keys, now 20, has not disappeared into oblivion after his 15 minutes of fame. Nor has he abandoned his position on violence. He has ambitions to become a local politician representing young loyalist communities that he describes as \u201cgoldmines\u201d left behind by unionist parties and education leaders.\nBut his willingness to discuss the possibility of a united Ireland, or a \u201cnew Ireland\u201d as he puts it, has led to him being branded a \u201cweak loyalist\u201d.\nSitting on a park bench next to a mural in the loyalist Belvoir estate in south Belfast, Keys explains how challenging, but exhilarating, life has been as he enters the political fray.\nHours before, former taoiseach Bertie Ahern had called similar estates in east Belfast \u201cghettos\u201d where people who might have got involved in trouble this year had \u201cno clue\u201d about the Northern Ireland protocol. Keys tweeted that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t care less\u201d what a \u201cretired politician\u201d had to say but protests that leaders expect loyalists to simply \u201cshut up\u201d about the Northern Ireland protocol.\n\u201cFor me the argument is about identity. I think a border on the island of Ireland was wrong but a border in the Irish sea is equally unacceptable. We have got to come up with something else. What we were given was an oasis, a mirage in the desert and now we are left just eating sand.\u201d\nHe says he is opposed to violence and that those who accused him of supporting it after his appearance before the select committee failed to listen to his full remarks. \u201cI like to choose my words carefully,\u201d he says, saying the only cohort who think violence is never justified are \u201cpacifists\u201d.\nKeys was asked to appear before the Northern Ireland affairs committee in May after being introduced to the Loyalist Communities Council (LCC), a group supported by the UDA, UVF and Red Hand Commando paramilitary groups, just two days before.\nHe had been arrested but released without further action in the Easter riots, and a BBC team working on a documentary about Northern Ireland\u2019s centenary with Patrick Kielty had been alerted to him. The comedian said he was worried that a smart, aware young man like Keys could get sucked into the ways of the past.\nKeys says he is not being sucked in: rather, he believes a fresh perspective is needed and the current batch of leaders in the Democratic Unionist or Ulster Unionist parties need \u201ca wake-up call\u201d to understand that a new generation wanted better education, jobs, homes and health outcomes, not the old politics of orange versus green.\n\u201cI talk to peers of my age and they could not tell you who Jeffrey Donaldson [the leader of the DUP] is. If you want to reach young people you need to do more,\u201d he said.\nI am genuinely disappointed that some people within the loyalist community feels that this approach and this logic is flawed, or perhaps even treacherous. I am, however, confident, that a good-faith approach is the best way forward.9/10\nPeter Shirlow, professor and director of the University of Liverpool\u2019s Institute of Irish studies, said Keys represents a younger generation with different views from their parents\u2019.\n\u201cWe have evidence, over and over again, that nearly half the people who say they want to stay in the union do not vote for Unionist parties. There\u2019s a younger generation who wants to talk about jobs, investment, et cetera. They don\u2019t want to hear about the past and legacy. They\u2019ve moved away,\u201d said Shirlow.\nKeys is considering politics but says the existing parties don\u2019t offer him a route to representation as they would constrain his attempts to move loyalism into a space where its views are communicated nationally.\nHe was recently hit by a backlash after suggesting on Twitter that the conversation over a united Ireland needed to be rebranded as a discussion of \u201cnew Ireland\u201d. He knew it was controversial, he says. For a unionist or loyalist to even enter this discussion is considered an act of \u201cbad faith\u201d and a concession to \u201cthe other side\u201d, a phrase he says he hates. \u201cI was accused of not being a real loyalist\u201d or a \u201cweak loyalist\u201d, he says.\nDays later the police called at his house to say a threat had been made against him, warning him the use of firearms \u201ccould not be ruled out\u201d.\nHe tweeted that he was \u201cgenuinely disappointed that some people within the loyalist community felt that this approach and this logic is flawed, or perhaps even treacherous\u201d.\nSitting beside a mural in Belvoir proclaiming \u201cyoung people can do wonderful things\u201d, he says: \u201cI am very proud of my British identity. I\u2019m confident in it. But I\u2019m eager to get stuck into these conversations because if someone, somewhere down the line hands us a silver plate with something that is better than what we have\u201d \u2013 in other words, a united Ireland \u2013 \u201care we \u2026 out of our minds to take it?\u201d\n\u201cPeople say \u2018nothing will be better than what we have\u2019,\u201d he says, pointing out that doesn\u2019t help prepare a unionist counter-argument against a united Ireland \u2013 or investigate whether underprivileged loyalist communities should demand better of their leaders.",

On 25 October it had been 70,271.\nHowever, as federal medical workers travel to Minnesota to support hospital response to the increase in cases, the country as a whole is still averaging far fewer cases a day than it did during the worst of the summer\u2019s Delta variant surge. People who are fully vaccinated are also far less likely to be hospitalized \u2013 and very unlikely to die \u2013 even if they are infected with the virus.\nBut several states with high rates of early vaccination take-up, including New Mexico, New Hampshire and Vermont, are also reporting elevated Covid case levels, suggesting that the efficacy of vaccines may be diminishing in terms of infection.\nAfter federal health authorities approved booster shots and vaccines for five- to 12 year-olds, the US is administering about 1.5m new doses a day, with a gently rising graph of vaccination rates still around 15 percentage points below the 80% threshold that epidemiologists would like to see.\nOn Friday, the FDA approved booster shots to all adults. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) agreed to the new policy.\nUnder the new rules, anyone 18 or older can choose either a Pfizer or Moderna booster six months after their last dose. For anyone who got the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine, the wait already was just two months. \u201cWe heard loud and clear that people needed something simpler and this, I think, is simple,\u201d FDA vaccine chief Dr Peter Marks told the Associated Press.\nAround a dozen states had already made boosters available to all adults. \u201cThe direction is not a good one. People are going inside more and, \u2018oops\u2019, next week happens to be the largest travel week of the year, so it probably makes sense to do whatever we can here to try to turn the tide,\u201d Marks added.\nSome experts worry that placing attention on boosters may harm efforts to reach the 47m US adults who remain unvaccinated and widen disparities between wealthy nations and poorer countries who have not been able to acquire sufficient vaccines to treat more than a fraction of their populations.\nThe rise in new US infections come as several European countries are reporting a brutal resurgence of the coronavirus pandemic. New infections are at record levels in some countries and Austria will reimpose a nationwide lockdown next week, while Germany is clamping down on unvaccinated people and has not ruled out imposing new restrictions on movement.\nThe European trend toward tighter controls, from mask mandates in Spain to a partial lockdown in the Netherlands, has also led to some outbreaks of unrest.\nViolent demonstrations broke out in Rotterdam on Friday night over the Netherlands\u2019 proposals to exclude negative tests from the national health pass, with police firing warning shots and breaking up crowds of protesters with water cannon. At least seven injuries were reported.\nIn the US, preparations for the Thanksgiving holiday next week hit new complications with reports of a shortage of Covid-19 home testing kits \u2013 a supplementary precaution for family members planning to come together for the first time in two years.\nDistributors have reported kit shortages, though pharmacy chains like CVS and Walgreens now say they have ample supplies as manufacturers, supported by more than $3bn in government spending, have increased production.\nHowever, health experts have also warned that a new surge of the virus could overwhelm supplies, especially if holiday gatherings and cooler temperatures spark new outbreaks across the country.\nThe number of US Covid-19 deaths recorded in 2021 has now surpassed the toll in 2020, according to federal data and Johns Hopkins University compiled Saturday and published in the Wall Street Journal. The total number of reported US deaths linked to the disease now surpasses 770,780: more than twice the 385,343 Covid-19 deaths recorded in 2020.",

        "content": "MPs from north of England vent rage in emergency call with minister Gillian Keegan amid backbench fury at costs faced by less well-off pensioners\nSenior Conservatives on Saturday urged Boris Johnson to ditch plans that would see many of England\u2019s poorest pensioners paying more for their social care \u2013 or risk being forced by his own MPs into a humiliating U-turn.\nThe prime minister, still reeling from sleaze allegations and fury among \u201cred wall\u201d MPs over scaled-back rail investment in the north, is facing another potentially damaging Commons rebellion at the hands of an increasingly mutinous party.\nThe Observer has learned that several northern Tory MPs took part in an emergency call set up by care minister Gillian Keegan on Friday afternoon, during which she was said to have been \u201cmonstered\u201d by backbenchers complaining that the plans were unfair and had not been fully explained or thought through.\nAccording to MPs in on the call, former Tory chief whip Mark Harper challenged Keegan to produce more detailed analysis of the plans \u2013 which neither she nor two civil servants present was able to do. Harper then said it would not be good enough for her to produce details on the day of the vote, which is expected to be Monday or Tuesday.\nTory whips are understood to have been told by several senior Tory MPs that they are considering voting against the plans, or abstaining, unless they are amended to make sure pensioners would not be forced to sell their homes to pay for their care, as Johnson previously promised.\nJeremy Hunt, former health secretary and current chair of the health select committee, said it was \u201cdeeply disappointing\u201d that the new plans were \u201cnot as progressive\u201d as those put forward by Andrew Dilnot, the economist who drew up the original plans for a cap on individual contributions. He said it would now be up to government to improve entitlements once the cap had been introduced.\nDamian Green, the former Tory cabinet minister, who was also on the call, told the Observer that the government should drop the plans and adopt a system that would guarantee that people could retain a percentage of their housing wealth.\n\u201cI would urge them to adopt a different approach,\u201d Green said. \u201cI think it would be infinitely preferable to guarantee that people can keep a percentage of their housing wealth rather than having a flat rate applying to the whole country.\u201d\nTory WhatsApp groups were said to be full of comments from MPs \u2013 including many in red wall seats \u2013 talking about a potential rebellion unless the government backed down.\nLast week, when MPs\u2019 minds were focused more on troubles over sleaze and the decision to axe the eastern section of the high-speed rail line to Leeds, ministers announced changes to social care plans which would mean poorer pensioners would not, after all, be able to count means-tested payments by the state for their care towards a total cap of \u00a386,000 for any individual. It is believed the change was made under pressure from the Treasury.\nCritics said this meant that while someone who owned a \u00a31m house would be able to protect more than 90% of their asset, someone with a home valued at \u00a370,000, in a less wealthy part of the country, would lose almost everything.\nDr Dan Poulter MP, who works part time as a psychiatrist in the NHS, said that the unwelcome change to the plans was the result of government not having set aside enough money for social care when its main announcements on extra NHS funding and care reform was made in September.\n\u201cThe initial set of proposals for a \u00a386,000 lifetime cap of social care costs were strong and addressed the injustice of people having to sell their homes to pay for their care, but there were always questions about whether the government\u2019s sums added up,\u201d Poulter said.\n\u201cSo, while this this policy change is surprising, I suspect it may well have been driven by the realisation that an extra \u00a35.6bn, while welcome, was never going to be enough to meet both the care and workforce challenges in the social care system as well as to properly finance the introduction of an \u00a386,000 cap on care costs. Unfortunately, it will be poorer pensioners who have relatively modest assets that will be most affected by these changes.\u201d\nWhen she announced the plans last Thursday, Keegan said they would \u201creduce complexity\u201d and ensure that people \u201care not unfairly reaching the cap at an artificially faster rate than what they contribute\u201d.\nAnalysis by the Observer shows that almost three-quarters of the seats the Tories won from Labour at the last election will be among those hit hardest by these changes.\nOf the 54 seats the Conservatives won from Labour in 2019, 41 have average house prices below that level. In the Burnley constituency, for example, the average house is worth \u00a399,950. In Darlington, it is \u00a3135,000 and in Durham North West it is \u00a3120,000, according to recent figures from the House of Commons library.\nAppearing before a committee of MPs last week, Dilnot said that about 60% of older people who end up needing social care would lose out under the government\u2019s plans.\n\u201cThe people most harshly affected by this change are those with assets of exactly \u00a3106,000,\u201d he said. \u201cBut everybody with assets of less than \u00a3186,000 would do less well under what the government is proposing than under the proposals we made and that were legislated for. That was a big change announced yesterday. It finds savings exclusively from the less well-off group.\u201d\nShadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: \u201cBoris Johnson\u2019s care plans are descending into chaos, with Tory MPs squabbling while ministers admit they haven\u2019t even studied how the proposals disproportionately hammer those with modest assets.\n\u201cAs civil servants confirm that these changes will clobber some of the poorest pensioners, many in the north and Midlands, Tory MPs must join with Labour in voting down this unfair care con and demand ministers come back with a fair alternative.\u201d\nCharles Tallack of the Health Foundation said the average house price in red wall seats of \u00a3160,000 meant they were \u201cmost likely to be affected by the proposed changes\u201d. The type of people currently using care are also more likely to be worse off under the plans. The majority of people in care are women over 80, who have a median wealth of \u00a3156,000.",

A sit-down protest forced police to divert traffic to other routes.\nEarlier on Saturday evening, the Met imposed public order conditions on the protest and urged the remaining protesters to leave. Four of the protesters had glued themselves together.\nThe public order notice said the group have \u201cno identified organiser\u201d and \u201cwarm clothing, food, seats\u201d and if they fail to leave, could face arrest.\nAn offshoot protest also blocked Vauxhall Bridge, the next bridge upriver.\nGabriella Ditton, 27, who was taking part in the demonstration at Lambeth Bridge said she believed she would end up in jail for taking part in the protests. She has been arrested six times with the campaign group, once for breaking the injunction.\n\u201cI have known for a couple of years that the only thing that is going to serve us is civil resistance. I have faith in people coming together.\n\u201cSolutions to this crisis exist, we just need the political will to do it.\u201d\nZoe Cohen, 51, who had travelled from Warrington in north-west England to take part, said: \u201cI am angry, distraught and grieving for the huge amount of nature that we have already lost.\u201d\nShe added that \u201cordinary people should not have to do this and risk prison\u201d.\n\u201cAny disruption is microscopic to the suffering of millions of people who are dying now across the world due to this crisis.\u201d\nInsulate Britain said it was not involved with setting up the event, which began after more than 200 supporters of the imprisoned activists gathered outside the Royal Courts of Justice in the afternoon.\nOne campaigner, Gully, told the crowd: \u201cMake no mistake, these are political prisoners and they will not be the last.\u201d\nThe group then walked from the courts to Westminster, chanting \u201cpower to the people\u201d.\nInsulate Britain began a wave of protests in September and blocked the M25, other roads in London, Birmingham and Manchester, and near the port of Dover in Kent.\nThe nine protesters were sentenced at the high court on Wednesday after admitting breaching an injunction by taking part in a blockade of the M25 during the morning rush hour on 8 October.",

        "content": "This would have to do for now but cannot do for much longer. Twice as many people were at the Camp Nou than the last time Barcelona played here in La Liga, 74,000 fans hoping to witness a brave new world. Instead, they watched as their side needed a Memphis Depay penalty to win the derby and begin the Xavi Hern\u00e1ndez era with a victory the new coach described as \u201cvital\u201d. Just.\nIf the opening night started well enough, it ended in nerves and a feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Relief too. There was youth, optimism and in the first half signs of something good, but reality intervened and Barcelona had to hang on against Espanyol, familiar flaws revealed. To repeat Gerard Piqu\u00e9\u2019s now famous phrase, \u201cit is what it is\u201d, and it is too early for Barcelona to be anything other than a team with issues to address.\n\u201cIn general, I\u2019m very happy but there are things to improve,\u201d Xavi conceded after a game in which Espanyol deserved more, wasting three clear chances to have equalised. With five minutes left and the home side having lost the thing their new manager most treasures \u2013 the ball \u2013 Ra\u00fal de Tom\u00e1s headed the last of those against the post.\nThis wasn\u2019t the way it was supposed to be. The sound of a new era came with Xavi\u2019s name chanted throughout, optimism returning, while a vision of it came with his first XI. There was a debut for 17-year-old winger Ilias Akhomach, one of eight La Masia graduates and three teenagers, which was part conviction, part circumstance: the new manager said he wanted to play with wingers opening up the pitch but the absence of Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, Ansu Fati and Sergi\u00f1o Dest meant he didn\u2019t really have any.\nPedri and Martin Braithwaite were also missing. Dani Alves has returned, aged 38, but will not play until January when, given how much \u00d3scar Mingueza struggled here, he may even be first choice. There are doubts whether Sergio Ag\u00fcero ever will, the forward having been diagnosed with a heart arrhythmia, although the club\u2019s vice president Rafael Yuste said that, contrary to reports that the Argentinan\u2019s retirement is imminent, he expects the full three-month observation period to be completed before any announcement is made. Xavi insisted: \u201cI don\u2019t know where those stories come from.\u201d\nWearing 37, Ilias started wide on the right and the first time the got the ball was dumped on the turf by Adri\u00e0 Pedrosa. The second time, he had a shot blocked. The third, he smashed a glorious chance over from seven yards. Thirteen minutes had been played and a pattern was emerging that saw Barcelona reach half-time with 70% of the possession and all the territory but no goals, although Diego L\u00f3pez had made a superb save from Memphis Depay at his near post.\nSergio Busquets had made that and his shot was also pushed away by the goalkeeper, who is 23 years older than Ilias and Gavi. For Espanyol, Ra\u00fal de Tom\u00e1s was the outlet, his control often impressing and one shot spinning on to the roof of the net.\nIlias was replaced by another young winger at half-time, 19-year-old Abde Ezzalzouli making his second appearance and soon becoming the first player booked after a confrontation with Pedrosa. By then, Barcelona had the lead. Gavi\u2019s neat pass released Depay who went down. The penalty was described as a \u201cjoke\u201d by De Tom\u00e1s but a VAR protocol that seeks contact rather than a foul validated the decision. Depay smashed in the shot and on the touchline, Xavi raised his fists.\nThis was not done yet though, and the momentum slipped from Barcelona. De Tom\u00e1s shot just wide having got in behind Mingueza again. He also bent a free-kick just wide. And Landry Dimata missed a simple header. \u201cNine times out of ten that goes in,\u201d lamented his manager, Vicente Moreno.\nBarcelona had lost control and confidence. They lost Busquets, another injury for the list. And they could even have lost an opening night victory with five minutes to go, Marc-Andr\u00e9 Ter Stegen and everyone else watching powerless as the ball came back off their post.",

        "content": "United have an imbalanced squad and a muddled long-term strategy did not help a manager who was clearly struggling\nManchester United are a club hooked on instant highs and short-term fixes, where memories are short and judgments are definitive, right up until the moment they aren\u2019t. New episodes arrive twice a week. Redemption is \u2013 usually \u2013 only ever 90 minutes away.\nUnited\u2019s 4-1 defeat at Watford on Saturday proved a watershed moment for Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s management, the final straw \u2013 except the humiliation against Manchester City was supposedly the final straw. So too the 5-0 trouncing at home to Liverpool. Or the time they conceded a goal to Istanbul Basaksehir without a single defender in their own half.\nEven so, the dead energy to United at this particular moment seems vaguely new and vaguely familiar all at once. The glumness and the vacant stares are redolent of the Louis van Gaal end-days; the half-paced running and basic lack of sacrifice a throwback to the Jos\u00e9 Mourinho years. If United in their worst moments under Solskj\u00e6r have occasionally looked like a team running around with no idea what it was doing, then it was at least marginally preferable to them not running around at all.\nAfterwards Solskj\u00e6r was asked where things were going wrong. Honestly, you may as well have asked him to explain the internal combustion engine. \u201cThat\u2019s human beings,\u201d he said in response to a question about why so many garlanded footballers were playing so drastically within themselves, and from his perspective it probably is that bafflingly simple. Humans. They play football. Sometimes they win. Sometimes they lose. Either way, enjoy it.\nOne actually felt for him. It\u2019s hardly Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s fault he was handed a job for which he was so patently ill-equipped, and with this in mind it\u2019s probably fair to say he exceeded expectations. He may not have the personality or the CV to mould a dressing room in his image, the tactical nuance required to coach title-winning sides. But for three years he at least kept the show on the road, reached a European final, made some memories. Nobody really saw that coming.\nAnd yet by a curious quirk of fate it is probably Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s lack of intrinsic ability that had kept him in the job this long. It is often said that managers can weather defeats but not being turned into a punchline. Solskj\u00e6r, by contrast, was appointed as a punchline, the Norwegian Ted Lasso, a fun sketch taken just a little too far. And so when things started going wrong the only real option was to double down on the joke, spin it out, suspend our disbelief even longer. To do anything else would be like Jason Sudeikis breaking the fourth wall and earnestly admitting to the audience that yes, the whole thing was actually fictional from the start.\nAs for the football itself, United were dysfunctional before Solskjaer arrived and will probably continue to be dysfunctional after he has gone. At times one could glimpse the bones of something promising in there: a second-placed league finish, big European scalps, a home-grown core with a sturdy defence and an exciting forward line (although not always at the same time). And so, in retrospect, the decision to go all-in on Jadon Sancho and Cristiano Ronaldo in the summer rather than strengthening in midfield or at full-back may go down as one of those crossroads moments in the club\u2019s modern history: the point at which they were on the verge of building a new house, but instead decided to blow it up for the YouTube numbers.\nIndeed, perhaps the biggest mistake United could make at this point was to conclude that Solskj\u00e6r is the root of their current problems. The rot goes far deeper: an imbalanced squad of many egos but few leaders, where players are signed on their individual merits and play largely the same way. The need for some sort of grand idea or defining identity can occasionally be overplayed a little \u2013 what is Chelsea\u2019s defining identity over the last decade, for example? But at a bare minimum you need a proper structure, applicable footballing expertise at boardroom level, a coach with more tools in his locker than \u201cjust believe in yourselves\u201d.\nUnited are too big and too rich to keep making the same mistakes indefinitely. Wealth and power are like an infinite supply of lottery tickets; one day, eventually, you\u2019ll nail it. It was Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s eternal ambition to be the man holding the ticket when that day came. Alas, his luck has finally run out.",

The plan is for an announcement to avoid describing Solskj\u00e6r as sacked and refer to a mutual agreement. Compensation and other final touches were being attended to after the board completed their discussions.\nSolskj\u00e6r admitted after a fourth defeat in five Premier League games that his team were \u201coutfought\u201d by Watford and had let the fans down but insisted he was able to turn their fortunes around. The board disagreed, however, and decided to make a change.\nThe first-team coach, Michael Carrick, and the club\u2019s technical director, Darren Fletcher \u2013 both successful former United players \u2013 are understood to be ready to take interim charge when Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s departure is confirmed.\nGlazer backed Solskj\u00e6r late last month despite the 5-0 humiliation by Liverpool after the executive vice-chairman, Ed Woodward, and managing director, Richard Arnold, joined Sir Alex Ferguson in throwing their support behind the manager. But the directors concluded there was no way back for Solskj\u00e6r after the latest defeat and chose to act before Tuesday\u2019s Champions League game at Villarreal.\nUnited responded to the Liverpool result by winning 3-0 at Tottenham but have since scrambled a late draw at Atalanta in the Champions League and been comprehensively beaten by Manchester City and a struggling Watford whose only previous home league victory came on the opening day against Aston Villa.\nThe disastrous outing at Vicarage Road brought to 15 the number of goals conceded by United in their past five league games, and David de Gea described the performance as \u201cembarrassing\u201d. Solskj\u00e6r was booed by United fans, some of whom also remonstrated with Bruno Fernandes, at full time.\n\u201cI always have belief in myself,\u201d Solskj\u00e6r said. \u201cOf course at the moment it\u2019s a difficult time for us. I can trust every single one out there to give their all. The staff are fantastic, but the results are difficult. I believe we can turn this around.\n\u201cWatford away from home, you need to give them a harder time than we did. They outfought us, we allowed them to put the ball in our box too easily. There are so many things that can go wrong in football and too many did in the first half.\u201d\nUnited were 2-0 down by half-time but their misery was compounded by late goals from Jo\u00e3o Pedro and Emmanuel Dennis, prompting a furious reaction from behind De Gea\u2019s goal. \u201cI understand fans who follow the club through thick and thin,\u201d Solskj\u00e6r said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a hard time since Sir Alex left and the fans who\u2019ve been with us have been unbelievable. The signings this summer raised expectations, we hoped to kick on and at the moment we can\u2019t seem to find our form.\u201d\nJadon Sancho, Cristiano Ronaldo and Rapha\u00ebl Varane were signed after United finished second last season and the club gave Solskj\u00e6r a contract extension to 2024 with an option for an extra year. He is leaving with the club seventh, six points off the Champions League places.\nSolskj\u00e6r said the first half at Watford was \u201cthe worst we\u2019ve played\u201d and told of the devastation in his dressing room. \u201cThe boys are in a terrible place in their heads now,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have let ourselves down and the fans down. It\u2019s hard to stand here and explain that but that\u2019s football and we have to take the flak for it.\u201d\nDe Gea, who saved a twice-taken penalty from Isma\u00efla Sarr early on, could not hide his disappointment. \u201cIt was embarrassing, the way we played today,\u201d he said. \u201cThe first half was very poor, it\u2019s not acceptable for this club and the level of players that we have. It\u2019s another nightmare. There\u2019s been some difficulties but I don\u2019t really know what to say.\n\u201cI have been in difficult moments with this club but we are in a difficult situation. We don\u2019t know what to do with the ball, we are conceding a lot of goals. It\u2019s a horrible moment.\u201d",

        "content": "Cabinet ministers have been meeting with gang leaders as the country targets an ambitious vaccination rate\nAfter the needle entered his right arm, the man raised his left fist in a brief salute. Surgical mask covering parts of his facial tattoos, he nodded to the nurse. A long ponytail cut a line through the blue and white letters covering his back: a patch, signifying membership of one of New Zealand\u2019s largest and most infamous street gangs. Mark Pitman, leader of Black Power New Zealand, was getting vaccinated on national television.\n\u201cI want to do it and I want the rest of our organisation around the country to know I\u2019ve got it done,\u201d Pitman told the camera. \u201cI\u2019m a leader. And I lead from example.\u201d\nPitman is one of a small but growing cohort of New Zealand gang leaders who have found themselves in the spotlight of the country\u2019s vaccination rollout, as it aims to get shots in the arms of the most vulnerable and hardest to reach. About 8,000 New Zealanders are members of street gangs, the best-known of which are the red-branded Mongrel Mob and blue Black Power, two usually competing factions with chapters across the country.\nSome gang members are involved in criminal activity, while many others are no more criminal than the communities from which they come, says Dr Jarrod Gilbert, director of criminal justice at University of Canterbury, who researches and documents gangs. However, gangs have an intimidating reputation in New Zealand. Pitman was previously sentenced to three-and-half years in prison and had a gang pad seized under the proceeds of crime act for masterminding what prosecutors alleged was a million dollar-plus a year drug-selling operation. \nNow, in its pursuit of some of the world\u2019s highest vaccination rates, New Zealand\u2019s government and health officials have found themselves working with unusual bedfellows. Cabinet ministers are meeting with gang leaders to hash out a strategy \u2013 and some have even been granted essential worker status in the Covid response. As some of New Zealand\u2019s most alienated, marginalised and distrustful communities, the gangs provide a microcosm of the challenges facing New Zealand\u2019s Covid response and vaccine rollout. But some experts and leaders say the Covid cooperation also presents an opportunity \u2013 to re-examine how the gangs and government relate, and to confront some of the social problems that feed their existence.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been on the road since Friday last week,\u201d says Harry Tam through a speaker phone intermittently cut out by GPS directions. The long-time affiliate of the Mongrel Mob, who has not been accused of involvement in organised crime, is behind the wheel again during this interview, reeling off destinations: \u201cWent to Rotorua to talk to some of the mob leaders from the Bay of Plenty \u2026 Waihau Bay, to the East Cape chapter \u2026 Kawerau, working with the president of the Te Teko chapter of the Notorious Mongrel Mob to vaccinate his members and their families \u2013 we did 27 that day.\u201d\nTam, who got involved with the Mongrel Mob when he was a teenager, has kept a foot in two worlds: as well as maintaining honorary Mob membership, he works in social service provision and spent years as a senior policy adviser. For the last two months, much of his time has been dedicated to sketching a line back and forth across New Zealand, town to town, gang pad to gang pad, patched member to member.\n\u201cWe are trying to beat the casualties,\u201d Tam says. But he says doing so involves trying to dismantle some of the distrust of government that has been bred over many years.\n\u201cAnd of course, our people have good reason to be suspicious of the government, because many of them come from a background where government hasn\u2019t been good to them.\u201d\nMany of the country\u2019s original gang members were raised in brutal circumstances as wards of the state. In the years since, families have often experienced multiple generations of abuse, family separation and poverty \u2013 interacting with the state primarily through the criminal justice system. Now, he says the government must learn from the Covid experience: neglecting communities like these can have repercussions through all of New Zealand.\n\u201cThere\u2019s one hell of a lesson here to be learned. It\u2019s amazing, governments have neglected this community for decades, and conveniently forgotten about it and then all of a sudden, Covid comes out, all of a sudden, they\u2019re all worried that if this community won\u2019t get vaccinated, they may infect us,\u201d he says.\n\u201cThis community is kicked around like a political football at the whim of politicians, never paying any attention as to why these communities exist and why they behave in the way that they do. There\u2019s no pro-social policies directed at them. The only policy is law enforcement, law enforcement and more law enforcement,\u201d Tam says.\nGovernment has acknowledged that \u201cGangs are in our community everywhere,\u201d says M\u0101ori development minister Willie Jackson. \u201cIt was a no-brainer to actually support some of their ideas in terms of getting them vaccinated.\u201d\nIt was Jackson who suggested to cabinet that he meet with the gang leaders \u2013 arguing that if they remained unvaccinated, the gangs and their networks around the country were not only at risk themselves, but putting others at risk too. The pathway forward, he said, had to be one of cooperation.\n\u201cHow do you get to them? Well, you\u2019ve got to get to them with their own.\u201d\nHe says the strategy has worked. Last weekend, Jackson spent Saturday at his local marae (M\u0101ori meeting ground), vaccinating the local king cobra gang. \u201cI\u2019m not a huge great gang supporter or whatever. I\u2019m a supporter of our community and other people.\u201d\n\u201cThe gangs are often a petri dish: you see reflected in there the acute examples of whatever is happening in society,\u201d say Gilbert. \u201cIf you can understand the gangs, you understand poverty, you understand intergenerational violence,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s no different now with the Covid response.\u201d\nThe latest examples of government dialogue with the gangs could inform other future programmes, he says. \u201cThe pragmatic moves here to address the Covid and vaccine issues within the gangs could just as easily be used to tackle the social problems that surround the gangs more generally.\u201d\nBut working with the gangs has risks \u2013 especially for politicians, who are acutely aware of the potential for blowback and negative headlines.\nTam, as well as at least one Mongrel Mob president, was granted essential worker status by the government to do this work, a fact that immediately generated headlines and accusations. Former deputy prime minister Winston Peters accused him on national television of using the status to smuggle a Covid-positive woman out of lockdown \u2013 a false claim that Peters was forced to retract and apologise for.\nGilbert says how the response to Tam illustrates the wider political challenges to the government of working with gang communities.\n\u201cThe government did take some highly pragmatic and \u2013 I would argue \u2013 very important moves to work with certain gang leaders to influence their communities. But of course it only took five minutes for that to be in the media before there were howls of protest,\u201d he says. \u201cThis situation is of our own making, because for the longest time, we\u2019ve talked about the gangs in wholly negative and quite sensationalist ways.\u201d\nAs minister, Jackson says those howls have been mostly silenced in the face of Covid. Pragmatism has won out. \u201cYou can\u2019t run your political strategy or your political party based on what\u2019s the next poll gonna be. You\u2019ve got to run it based on principle.\u201d",

        "content": "Paine reveals media outlets had approached him several times about the controversy \nTim Paine says he always knew the texting scandal that cost him the Australian Test captaincy would eventually be made public, revealing media had approached him about it \u201cnumerous times\u201d over the past three years.\nHis comments come as former Cricket Australia board members on Sunday criticised the current administration over its handling of the saga, with then-chairman David Peever accusing it of \u201cabandoning\u201d Payne via a \u201cknee-jerk reaction\u201d and former director Mark Taylor defending the decision to keep the investigation \u201cin house\u201d.\nPaine sent Australia\u2019s Ashes preparations into chaos on Friday afternoon when, less than three weeks before the start of the series against England, he stood down over explicit text messages and a graphic image sent to a female former Cricket Tasmania employee in 2017.\nAt the press conference in Hobart, the 36-year-old said he \u201cdeeply regretted\u201d his actions and, although an integrity unit investigation in 2018 cleared him of any breach of Cricket Australia\u2019s code of conduct, he had become aware the private exchange was about to be released.\nTwo days later, in an extensive and personal interview alongside his wife Bonnie for News Corp, Paine said he \u201cabsolutely\u201d believed the controversy was a ticking time bomb, based on previous attempts to have it published.\n\u201cI thought the issue was dealt with, but it always popped up around a big series, or at the start of the cricket season,\u201d Paine said on Sunday.\n\u201cOver the last three years, there have been numerous times where media agencies have put to us that they had evidence, yet they never chose to write it. As to why, I\u2019m not sure, but nobody else had chosen to write the story, but I knew it was going to come out at some point, as much as I didn\u2019t want it to.\u201d\nPaine remains adamant the texts were fully consensual and said they did not make him reluctant to take up the Test captaincy in March 2018. He says he was not aware they were an issue until May 2018, when then-Cricket Tasmania chief executive Nick Cummins rang to ask him about them.\n\u201cBecause it was a consensual exchange of messages months beforehand, I didn\u2019t think it was anything to consider,\u201d Paine said. \u201cI never thought for a moment that it would become an issue. I was just excited and honoured to be asked.\u201d\nPaine\u2019s admissions pose further questions about why CA management did not further scrutinise the investigation given it occurred only a couple of months after appointing him to replace Steve Smith in the fallout of the ball-tampering scandal during Australia\u2019s infamous South Africa tour.\nOn Saturday CA chairman Richard Freudenstein and chief executive Nick Hockley blamed previous administrators for allowing Paine to remain as skipper, and said he should have been stood down when he was first investigated.\n\u201cI can\u2019t talk about the 2018 decision, I wasn\u2019t there,\u201d Freudenstein said. \u201cBut I am saying, based on the facts as they are, today the board of Cricket Australia would not have made that decision.\n\u201cI acknowledge the decision clearly sent the wrong message that this behaviour is acceptable and without serious consequences. The role of Australian cricket captain must be held to the highest standards.\u201d\nBut Peever on Sunday attacked CA for trying to claim the moral high ground, describing Paine as \u201can incredible servant of the game\u201d and accusing the governing body of trying to \u201cmake up your own rules as you go\u201d.\n\u201cCricket Australia\u2019s decision seems knee jerk and unfortunately shows double standards. The issue has been doing the rounds in cricket circles for some years now,\u201d Peever said in a statement to News Corp. \u201cThe current chairman has been on the board for two years and it is implausible he didn\u2019t know about it. If he and his board felt so strongly about it, why wait until now to act?\u201d\nFreudenstein said he considered the case closed when he joined CA\u2019s board in 2019 in his explanation as to why action on Paine\u2019s behaviour was not taken earlier, adding that background checks would be conducted on potential captaincy successors, with pace-bowling spearhead and vice-captain Pat Cummins favoured to take on the role and Smith a possible alternative.\nTaylor, who was a member of the CA board for 13 years before resigning in late 2018 as one of the final casualties of the ball-tampering saga, agreed Paine\u2019s call to stand down but defended the decision not to make the investigation public in 2018.\n\u201cA decision was taken by the integrity unit and supported by the board to keep this in house,\u201d Taylor told the Nine Network. \u201cThere\u2019s obviously been a lot of conjecture about the rights and wrongs of that. That decision was made not just on what is best for cricket, but what was best for Tim Paine, Bonnie Paine and also the woman involved.\u201d\nPaine, a wicket-keeper batsman who resurrected his Test career against England in late 2017, remains available for Ashes selection and on Sunday indicated his desire to end his Test career on the \u201cultimate high\u201d of an Australian series defence at home.\nHe said national team coach Justin Langer had encouraged him to continue as captain, but reiterated he felt a responsibility to stand down.\n\u201cJL told me he\u2019s devastated,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was pretty firm that he wanted me to continue as captain, and again, once I explained to him the reasons that I thought resigning was the best thing to do, he was with me all the way.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got messages from all my teammates saying they\u2019ve got my back, and that we all make mistakes, and we move on.\u201d",

        "content": "Surgery in isolated market town has had no applicants, leaving one doctor serving a population of 2,000\nNestled among towering Cumbrian hills and accessible by just a handful of roads, Alston Moor is said to be the highest market town in England. There are few amenities on the doorstep \u2013 getting a takeaway delivery is out of the question \u2013 so it may not immediately seem like the most desirable place for a doctor to settle down, especially if they are used to the hustle and bustle of a city.\nBut what may have been a bit of a challenge in the past has now become a major headache for the town, one of the most remote places in England, which is in desperate need of a GP. A nine-month-long search has so far yielded not a single application.\nAlston Moor needs two GPs to run its practice but only has one, due to the retirement of a longstanding doctor who left after 30 years of service. The remaining GP, Dr Claire Corlett, is holding the fort, looking after 2,000 patients \u2013 virtually the town\u2019s entire population \u2013 alone.\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t even had one application,\u201d Corlett said. \u201cHistorically, we\u2019ve always found it difficult to recruit. But I think it\u2019s because of where we are, because we\u2019re so remote and rural.\u201d\nAlston\u2019s dilemma comes amid a general shortage of GPs, with the Royal College of GPs (RCGP) in September saying doctors were \u201cfinding it increasingly hard to guarantee safe care\u201d for millions of patients because they were unable to cope with soaring demand.\nGP numbers have fallen by 4.5% since 2015 \u2013 in some parts of Cumbria, by as much as 24% \u2013 while demand has risen with a growing and ageing population. In May, the British Medical Association said Covid-19 had tested GPs \u201clike never before\u201d, and warned that they would need considerably more financial support from the government while coming out of the pandemic.\nWhat makes the role in Alston slightly more unusual is that the new doctor would need to be on hand for medical emergencies that happen locally, as the area is so cut off that it can take a while for an ambulance to arrive.\nResidents are currently trying to save their local ambulance service, which is due to be cut and replaced by a community first responder \u2013 a trained member of the public rather than a medical professional.\nCorlett, who has been at the practice for four and a half years, was worried about taking on this work when she first started the job but says it has not been as daunting as she expected.\n\u201cWe do, if needed, go out to emergencies. If we think somebody\u2019s having a heart attack and might need a defibrillator before the ambulance can get here, then we will go with the defib.\n\u201cThat\u2019s something when I first came here I was frightened about because that\u2019s not really my thing,\u201d she said.\nThe hands-on element of the job became a welcome change from what she felt was essentially directing patients to other services as a GP in a busy urban practice, which almost drove her to quit general practice altogether.\nShe said: \u201cI wasn\u2019t really sure whether I wanted to be a GP any more, and then ended up here, and I love it. It\u2019s amazing, it\u2019s beautiful. It\u2019s a lovely community.\u201d\nAlston Moor is in an area of outstanding natural beauty, with breathtaking views across rolling green hills and wild moorland.\nCorlett thinks the area could be misunderstood as a kind of backwater, where the people are old-fashioned, but that could not be further from the truth.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lovely, lovely, lovely practice. And I wish I could bring people here and kind of show them and let them work here for a day because then I think they\u2019d drop their inner-city jobs and come and live up here,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI ended up here very serendipitously. I saw a job advert and thought I\u2019d go have a look, and I\u2019d been here for about five minutes when I knew I wanted to come.\u201d\nThe residents embraced her immediately, offering suggestions as to where she should live. She was even taken down a mine to be shown the work done by the local rescue unit.\n\u201cYou feel very much part of the community and that you\u2019re not just a person\u2019s GP,\u201d she said.",

I\u2019ll be planting 100 trees to give back to the planet rather than padding to the overconsumption by tempting people to buy more than they want or need,\u201d said Sophie de Taranto, owner of Shutter Jewellery.\nThe founders of Pantee, a sustainable underwear brand, plan to switch off their website. \u201cThe only people able to access our site will be engaged members of our community that have signed up to our mailing list and got a password\u2026 no sales, no impulse buying,\u201d said co-founder Katie McCourt. \u201cOur message this Black Friday is to stop and think before you buy. Is it something you love? Is it something you need?\u201d\nBirmingham-based jeweller and goldsmith Ruth Mary Chipperfield will be releasing a video on Friday giving tips on how to repair jewellery on her website, ruthmary.com. \u201cOn anti-Black Friday, I\u2019m encouraging people to look inside their jewellery box and instead of buying new, have treasured pieces repaired,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m saying: look at the great things you already have. You don\u2019t need to buy anything new. Actually, a really nice Christmas present for some people might be a ring they thought was broken, but gets snuck out of their jewellery box by a loved one and is given to them on Christmas Day, completely restored.\u201d\nAs the anti-Black Friday movement grows in popularity, many shoppers are not only turning back to their local high streets and markets but are increasingly looking online for ways to shop locally. On Facebook, a group called Not on Amazon was started last November and now has more than 157,000 members. Founded by Jamie Rackham, who runs a small upcycling business making furniture in the Forest of Dean, it is a place where owners of independent creative and artisan businesses can freely advertise the products they have made to others in the group.\n\u201cThis time last year we were going to do some Christmas markets and they were all cancelled,\u201d said Rackham. \u201cAt the same time, I heard about Amazon making a record amount of profits during lockdown. I thought: this is so wrong. They\u2019re making all of this money and we\u2019re being told we can\u2019t operate our businesses. I\u2019ve got to try and do something about this.\u201d\nHe has been so taken aback by the success of his Facebook group that last week he launched a crowdfunding campaign for a gallery he has set up. He hopes to create a space where members of Not on Amazon can display their work for sale and come and share information and ideas with each other.\nLast week also saw the launch of another website designed to showcase and generate sales for independent shops across the country. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of sickening, what happened to our local high streets during the pandemic,\u201d said Dr Jackie Mulligan, the founder of Shoplocalonline.org. \u201cSmall businesses weren\u2019t allowed to trade, they were deemed non-essential in many categories. And then we saw a billionaire [Amazon founder Jeff Bezos] propelling himself into space. It just doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d\nShe set up the website partly as a response to Black Friday. \u201cBlack Friday is decimating the high street \u2013 it\u2019s the Grinch that has stolen Christmas from smaller retailers. Small retailers don\u2019t want to pay 30% commission to an online giant, they don\u2019t want their things coming out of a fulfilment warehouse. They just want to be able to serve their customers.\u201d\nAny independent retailer can join the website for free until the end of January, and she promises no commission will ever be taken on their sales. More than 4,000 small independent retailers in at least 100 towns and cities have signed up so far. \u201cAll the businesses that are on Shoplocalonline.org are real places: market stalls, pop-up shops, actual bricks-and-mortar businesses. If you care about those places, this is a chance to spend with them.\u201dThe website follows in the footsteps of Bookshop.org, which launched a year ago to support independent bookshops. It has generated almost \u00a31.8m for nearly 500 bookshops.\nAndrew Goodacre, head of Bira, said. \u201cThe pandemic has been very difficult for those retailers classed as non-essential. In the past 18 months they have suffered three lockdowns, weeks of restrictive regulations and are now just starting to build back their business. Christmas is going to be an incredibly important season for independent retailers.\n\u201cWe know shoppers have returned to shopping on the high street as they start to prepare for the festive period but we need stronger sales in November and December to help retailers take on the many challenges that await them in 2022.\u201d",

        "content": "The acclaimed French director has created another gem with this magical story of a young girl coming to terms with her grandmother\u2019s death\nDoes French film-maker C\u00e9line Sciamma ever put a foot wrong? As a writer-director, her \u201caccidental trilogy of youth\u201d climaxed in the contemporary urban classic Girlhood (2014), after which she conquered the world of the 18th century in Portrait of a Lady on Fire (2019) \u2013 both near-perfect masterpieces. Now with Petite Maman she proves herself a maestro of the modern fable, conjuring a U-certificate treat that goes straight into my list of the greatest films ever made for children of all ages. \u201cWhat would Miyazaki do?\u201d was apparently Sciamma\u2019s creative mantra, and you can feel the timeless energy of Studio Ghibli\u2019s finest features haunting her creative decisions. Whether you are six or 60, this astonishingly insightful and heartbreakingly hopeful cinematic poem will pierce your heart, broaden your mind and gladden your soul, even as you wipe away tears.\nWhen her beloved grandmother dies, eight-year-old Nelly (Jos\u00e9phine Sanz) worries that she didn\u2019t say goodbye properly, not realising that the end was so near. At the ever-so-slightly mysterious house by the woods where Grandma lived, the task begins of clearing away the past. While her mum (Nina Meurisse) and dad (St\u00e9phane Varupenne) pack up memories and face their own personal demons (\u201cI get the feeling everyone is asking themselves questions\u201d), Nelly ventures out among the autumn trees, whistling down the wind where her mother once roamed as a child.\nHere, she happens upon a young girl, Marion, played by Josephine\u2019s real-life twin, Gabrielle Sanz. Marion shares Nelly\u2019s mother\u2019s name, and lives in a house that strangely mirrors that of her grandmother. Indeed, Marion\u2019s life chimes so closely with tales Nelly has been told of her mother\u2019s childhood that she reaches a bold conclusion, telling her new friend: \u201cI come from the path behind you\u2026\u201d\nLike the sublime Sciamma-scripted stop-motion animation My Life as a Courgette (2016), Petite Maman is short and sweet, yet fearlessly profound. A mix of fairytale, ghost story and rites-of-passage journey, this is at heart a cinematic parable about healing intergenerational wounds, about breaching the barriers that inevitably grow between parents and children. It\u2019s also a brilliantly cheeky \u201cwhat if?\u201d story, a lower-key riff on the crash-bang time-travelling pyrotechnics of Back to the Future.\nWhat\u2019s astonishing is the way Sciamma uses her central conceit to allow characters to speak to each other across great divides \u2013 for children to see the dreams their parents once nurtured and to be reassured that \u201cyou didn\u2019t invent my sadness\u201d. Oh, to be able to have those conversations, in such wonderfully ordinary surroundings! What fantastical flight of fantasy could be more thrilling, more enriching, more healing? Who needs a DeLorean or a flux capacitor when you have this?\nShot in intimately natural hues by cinematographer Claire Mathon, whose recent credits include the shimmering current release Spencer, Petite Maman has a tactile, earthy quality that at times reminded me of the Dardenne brothers\u2019 underrated oddity The Silence of Lorna, another film that slips effortlessly between potentially Grimm realities. As with her early features Water Lilies and Tomboy, Sciamma has a keen eye for those moments where childhood and adulthood blur, with Nelly (who seems from the outset to be maternally protective of her mother) play-acting grown-up life with Marion while her mum is infantilised by returning to her childhood room, surrounded by her old books and shadowy nightmares of panthers at the end of the bed.\nThere\u2019s also the sheer joy of a scene in which Nelly and Marion make pancakes, which combines the youthful glee of The Florida Project with the bittersweet fantasy of the \u201cperfect day\u201d coda from Spielberg\u2019s AI: Artificial Intelligence. I honestly can\u2019t remember the last time I smiled so widely in a cinema, albeit from behind the protective covering of a mask.\nAs with Portrait of a Lady on Fire, Sciamma once again makes sparse but pointed use of music, with an 1980s-tinged song co-written with regular collaborator Para One (AKA Jean-Baptiste de Laubier) accompanying a blissful interlude of surreal childhood adventure, perfectly encapsulating the dreams, aspirations and quietly rebellious spirit of this utterly spellbinding little gem.",

        "content": "With the Twickenham crowd screaming at the end of a helter-skelter game, the England fly-half was the calmest man around to slot the match-winning penalty\nAnd Eddie said it wasn\u2019t about revenge. You could have fooled me in the final hectic moments of this helter-skelter game, when all the Twickenham crowd was up on its feet and screaming, while the players down below set about each other, pushing and shoving in the rush of blood, everyone desperate to stake their claim on the game. There were two points in it then, and less than a minute left to play. And from the middle of all this chaos, out stepped Marcus Smith, to line up the match-winning kick. It was only 25 metres or so out, but these were, without doubt, the highest stakes he\u2019s played for yet.\nWatching on from the sidelines, Jonny Hill turned to Courtney Lawes and said \u201cimagine taking this kick\u201d. Away behind Smith, Freddie Steward was muttering to himself \u201cplease don\u2019t miss, please don\u2019t miss.\u201d\nSmith didn\u2019t even seem to think twice. Of course, he made it. Even then, South Africa weren\u2019t done fighting. Referee Andrew Brace had to bring in the TMO to rule on one last England penalty after the restart, after Eben Etzebeth clattered into Steward as he made a catch. And again everyone swarmed around Brace, fighting over his decision. Lawes, who had already been replaced, even came charging on to the pitch himself, and had to be pulled away again by Hill, who chased after him. Lawes said afterwards that he had got overexcited because he thought the game was over already.\nWhen Brace finally blew his whistle again, the South Africans charged Smith, who had to whip quickly around on his heels and boot the ball backwards into touch. I\u2019m not sure Twickenham has ever sounded as loud as it did in those final moments.\nGod, but it was a hell of a game, a reminder of everything you love about Test rugby. It was one of England\u2019s best wins since Jones took charge in 2016, all the better because it looked, for so long, like they were bound to lose. Me, I thought they\u2019d blown it when there were five minutes left, and they were trailing by two points. They won a penalty after Siya Kolisi took out Joe Marchant in the air. It was in goal-kicking distance, a metre or so inside South Africa\u2019s half, but they decided to kick to touch instead. They had only just scored a brilliant try off a lineout, so you could understand why, but this time Etzebeth stole the ball, and the chance was gone.\nSouth Africa had dominated the second half. England had the edge in the scrums in the first 40 minutes, when their rookie front row won all four. They were awarded three penalties off them, and scored tries off the back of two. But South Africa readjusted at half time and the game had changed. They won three scrum penalties in a row, two against Kyle Sinckler, and another against Will Stuart, who were both penalised for standing up, buckling under the intolerable pressure. The second of them led to a lineout, which South Africa turned into a rolling maul that rumbled 10m, then 20m downfield into England\u2019s 22. Desperate, they conceded another penalty for collapsing the maul.\nSo, South Africa mauled again. And this time came right up to England\u2019s try line. It became a game of inches, a pile of mad thrashing bodies in a heap, the ball lost somewhere in the thick of it, till it emerged, somehow, in the arms of Max Malins, flat on his back, and beaming a brilliant smile. Those are the moments, down there in the dirt, fighting to hold the line, that tell you so much about the character of a team. England didn\u2019t win the match then, but they would have lost it if they\u2019d given in. \u201cThe only reason we won that game is we were fighting for each other,\u201d Lawes said afterwards.\nSouth Africa had to settle for a penalty. That made it a one-point game, 18-17. And then England scored that try. It was a brilliant one, against the run of play. They went short at a lineout in midfield, Raffi Quirke slipped the ball to Henry Slade, who snapped it on to Marchant while Smith ran a dummy loop around the back that wrongfooted the defenders lining up in front of them. Marchant beat Lukhanyo Am with a step, and set off downfield. Quirke, razor quick, was right there alongside him on his inside shoulder to take the final pass. It was a lethal bit of finishing. But it brought them only a minute\u2019s grace. South Africa scored off what felt like the very next play, and it was back to being a one-point game again. Then South Africa kicked the penalty to go two points ahead, and set up those final minutes.\nJones said there\u2019s a lot left to work on. They conceded 18 penalties. In Test rugby, teams aim to keep their total in single figures but England\u2019s indiscipline has been a running theme this year and unless they fix it, it is going to cost them sooner rather than later. But Jones, a relentless taskmaster, wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. He wants them ready for 2023, and there are, undoubtedly, the makings of a very special team here.",

        "content": "After years of searching, DNA tests, social media and old-fashioned tenacity have played crucial roles in reuniting fractured families. Here, six people tell their stories\nI used to go by Larecia Whitehead, I changed my second name to Buford \u2013 my real father\u2019s name \u2013 when a DNA test led us to each other after decades apart. For most of my childhood, Mum told me another guy was my father, a man I never knew and who left us when I could barely walk or talk. I was never convinced. Then, at 15, a girl in school recognised my then surname and introduced me to the man my mother always said was my dad. We looked nothing alike. He didn\u2019t think I was his daughter either. Fastforward to me being 31, and I needed certainty. Once again I tracked down the man my mum said was my dad and asked him to do a DNA test. The results came back: there was a 0% chance we were related. I\u2019d been right all along.\nA year later I turned to online DNA tests, unsurprisingly not matching with the Whitehead family. There were random third and fourth cousins, but I was at a loss. Thankfully, a friend connected me with a search angel \u2013 volunteers who help people like me find their lost relatives. It wasn\u2019t an easy task \u2013 turns out my dad was one of 12 siblings. But 21 days later, my search angel had found my father.\nI showed him a picture of my mum and he recognised her instantly. The DNA tests matched. It\u2019s strange; to this day my mum is adamant they\u2019ve never met. Dad says they were only together three times. I reckon Mum is just in denial. Now she accepts him; we do things as a family. Still, she has no memory of him at all.\nAnd here\u2019s the craziest bit: there had always been question marks over whether my dad had been a father. Not to me, but to a boy. He\u2019d raised a son, when in fact he was the child of another man. Dad needed me as much as I needed him. Being his only child, meanwhile, worked out perfectly for me; after 35 years apart, selfishly, I didn\u2019t want to share him.\nWe live together now. He\u2019s more than just a father, he\u2019s a best friend. In a matter of months he went from total stranger to being one of the most important people in my life; the same for my children.\nI\u2019m going to write a book, not just to tell this story but to try to reach teenagers who also have missing parents. If I\u2019d found him sooner, I could have had so many more years of loving \u2013 and being loved by \u2013 my father. I want to encourage others to not waste any time.\nMy mum had me when she was 17, super young. I lived with her for a few years as a baby, but I ended up being raised by my grandma. I never knew who my father was, and my mum didn\u2019t either; let\u2019s say back then she was living young, wild and free in Las Vegas. It\u2019s a city where plenty of men come and go. Right after I was born, we took a bunch of paternity tests. None of the potential candidates that Mum identified matched my genetics. Well into high school, I just accepted it would never be figured out.\nAnd then in 2016, out of the blue, my grandma bought us both DNA tests online. Our intention was to learn about my ethnic makeup, that was all. Mum had mentioned previously she\u2019d been dating \u2013 among others \u2013 a Puerto Rican guy at the time of my conception. I have a different complexion to the rest of our family. I didn\u2019t intend to find my father, but my roots. Opening the results was one the most shocking moments of my life \u2013 apparently I\u2019m exactly half Afghan. Lower down the page was a long list of cousins: once you spit in the tube and send it in, you receive a list of relatives who have also signed up. Some of them \u2013 from names alone \u2013 I just knew would have to be related to my dad. For the first time, my father felt real.\nI called Mum and suddenly a memory of a man was triggered. Maybe there was this one Middle Eastern guy, she said, but they\u2019d only met once. She\u2019d never considered him a possibility.\nI messaged one of these newfound cousins and explained my situation. All I knew is that this man would have been in town nine months before I was born. Our exchanges were sporadic. Finally, last November, they sent me a list of names. I asked my mum: he could, she recalled, be an Alex? The final name on the list. Alex lived in Afghanistan with his wife and kids, but his mother \u2013 my prospective grandmother \u2013 lived a short drive from me. Our DNA matched. A few weeks ago, I had my first video call with my dad.\nHe wasn\u2019t a visitor, but local. Lots of his family are still here in Vegas; with open arms they\u2019ve welcomed me. I still face an identity crisis, only a different type. Does this new information change me? I want to embrace my heritage, but I wasn\u2019t raised with it; would that make me an impostor? With their support, I\u2019m soaking up Afghan culture. At parties, they all speak Farsi \u2013 I want to learn the familial language. I know next to nothing about their customs, food or reference points. I\u2019m excited to embrace it all, and to one day meet my father. Because being Afghan, it turns out, is a huge part of who I am.\nI was always interested in genealogy and when I did a DNA test in 2012 I didn\u2019t think much of it. I knew, or so I thought, all about my family history \u2013 I was doing it for fun. My parents were Irish American Catholics; all my ancestors were originally from the British Isles. Instead, the results showed I was only half Irish, Scottish or English. The rest of me was European Jewish. Of course, one can be Jewish and British, but DNA testing identifies people of Jewish heritage as a distinct group. It made no sense. At first I thought it was a mistake; maybe one side of our family had hidden their background.\nMy sister and I went into detective mode and asked two cousins to take DNA tests: one on Mum\u2019s side, and one on my father\u2019s. That way, I hoped, we\u2019d decipher where the Jewish genes were from and work from there. The results took an age, but finally came back: both were Irish; none of our cousins shared our Jewish heritage. Even stranger was the fact that while my sister and I matched as relatives with my mother\u2019s side of the family, genetically speaking my cousin on Dad\u2019s side was a total stranger. My father\u2019s sister was not his sister. Somehow, my father had Jewish genes, but his parents \u2013 my grandparents \u2013 had not. It was a mystery.\nDad was the son of Irish immigrants. We had his birth certificate, showing he\u2019d been born on 23 September 1913. We knew he was raised in a New York orphanage. At this point, we questioned whether something had gone wrong in the system and two children in the home had been confused for each other. But the sole picture I had of my father as a young child matched the man I knew.\nWithin two weeks of receiving our cousin\u2019s DNA results, we settled on a new theory: that our father was switched with an Irish baby while the two were newborns in the hospital. It was the only scenario that made sense. It was the only way Dad could somehow have not been related to his own parents. We then spent two and a half years searching for a close Jewish relative who had taken a DNA test to confirm what we thought.\nI periodically checked my Irish \u201ccousin\u2019s\u201d DNA results online to see if he had acquired any unexpected relatives. Amazingly, he was contacted by a new cousin, a generation below me, who\u2019d expected to be genetically Jewish, but discovered she was Irish instead. And yes, this woman\u2019s grandfather was also born on 23 September 1913. The babies had been sent home with the wrong parents: an Irish boy had been sent home with a Jewish family. My Jewish father \u2013 Jim Collins \u2013 had been raised Irish instead.\nWe tracked down the other family \u2013 the news to them was also shocking. As soon as we looked at pictures of Jim \u2013 it all clicked into place. The strangest part is all the coincidences we later discovered: how my dad, Jim, was a gambler just like his biological father; how he loved gefilte fish and didn\u2019t eat pork, despite never knowing he was Jewish. Whoever his parents were, my dad was still my dad.\nWhen I was two years old, one of my two younger brothers passed away. I grew older and started my own family, and I too lost a child of my own.\nTwo and half months ago, I saw a message when I logged into Facebook from a stranger: I\u2019m pretty sure we are brother and sister, it said. I\u2019d done a DNA test a few years earlier, but got nothing. Suddenly, here was this sister out the blue. She\u2019d been searching for us for 35 years.\nWe\u2019ve basically been neighbours our whole lives \u2013 she\u2019s only 10 miles down the road; I\u2019ve known her husband for 25 years, and we have an unbelievable number of mutual friends.\nMy parents are both dead; after my first younger brother died, my father struggled with alcoholism. He was running around doing whatever, clearly getting someone pregnant in between the births of me and my living brother. As far as I know, he never knew, and neither did we. I ordered a special test which can identify siblings, and drove to her house.\nAs soon as she answered the door taking a further test seemed pointless. The woman standing in front of me was the spitting image of my dad. When the results came back, lo and behold, she\u2019d been right.\nThe next day, our families met. We all went for dinner, then returned to my place. It was only when I sat down in my house that I realised: my sister was six years younger than me; my father had died exactly six years ago to the day.\nToday she\u2019s a huge part of my life. We talk every day, she\u2019s a missing piece of my life\u2019s puzzle.\nI\u2019m so happy about it all: after losing a kid, family becomes even more precious. And here I am, with a new sister, niece and nephew. They\u2019re a blessing\u2026 and who knows how many more of us there are still to find?\nMum was only 18 when she got pregnant. The father? They weren\u2019t together and let\u2019s just say he wasn\u2019t around. Her family were devout Catholics. Back then, lots of young, single expectant mothers were sent to these awful institutions, where they\u2019d give birth and have their babies given away. Six weeks before I was born, Mum was sent to Brettargh Holt in Kendal \u2013 a convent staffed by Sisters of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and Mary. After giving birth, Mum upped and left with me in tow. She never spoke to her parents again. Life was tough, and she did it all on her own. Unsurprisingly, she wasn\u2019t keen on talking about everything that had happened. Growing up, I had no idea who my father was.\nDuring the summer, my skin naturally tanned quicker than most of the other kids, which saw me get bullied. When I was six or seven, Mum sat me down and explained why. My dad, she told me, was Italian. That was the only piece of information she ever wanted to share. And so there was always a sense of guilt attached to me trying to find him. On and off since my 20s, I tried to track him down. Many years later, my estranged maternal grandma sent me a letter. His name was Antonio, she told us; this is the street where he was lodging at the time. I knocked on every single door and found his old landlady. She remembered the young Italian lad\u2019s name.\nI found him on Facebook, and sent him a message. Right away, he knew who I was. Soon he had a DNA kit in his hands. He was on a Zanzibar beach when \u2013 in his 80s \u2013 Dad discovered he was a father, grandfather and great-grandfather for the very first time.\nToday we have a great relationship; he calls me his little miracle. We\u2019ve still not talked much about all that happened between Mum and him; why for so long he wasn\u2019t a present parent. He\u2019s an elderly man now. One day, maybe I will. Mum died in 2003. I\u2019m not sure how she\u2019d have felt about me and him connecting. At times I feel guilty, but he\u2019s a wonderful man, a special addition to my life. We may have missed out on memories, but there\u2019s still time for us to make plenty more.\nMy sister and I are close. We were both adopted by my parents, but the two of us are not biologically related. When my mum gave birth to our younger brother a few years after we arrived, it was a real surprise for all. Mum and Dad were always open about our adoption; they\u2019d read us a book called The Chosen Baby. I\u2019ve also always had admiration for the woman who gave me up. It must have been so hard to do.\nI\u2019ve always been super-curious about my genetics. I\u2019ve been married five years, but don\u2019t have children. That means I\u2019ve never met anyone \u2013 my age, older or younger \u2013 who shares my DNA. Still, I was cautious about digging around; not wanting to upset my parents; aware that appearing in other people\u2019s lives can, of course, cause upset and drama. So little was known about my biological parents \u2013 the name my birth mother gave on the adoption papers was a decoy \u2013 that I decided I simply needed to know more.\nIt was Christmas 2018 when I finally took a DNA test. I got the results on St Patrick\u2019s day. I remember because it said I have some Irish blood. Through the site, I connected with a half-uncle \u2013 my first ever blood relation. He knew a little about my mother, Barbara: a bit of a troublemaker, in and out of prison. When she was pregnant with me, she stole her brother\u2019s car and drove across the country to secretly give birth. She\u2019d been married at that point; I was the child of her extramarital affair. And, he informed me I had a half-sister \u2013 an actor in Hollywood. I reached out to her; DNA tests confirmed we shared a birth mother.\nI was overwhelmed. As a child, I\u2019d watched her play the sassy middle sister on television in a popular television sitcom I loved. To find out we were related was heartwarming. I\u2019d spent a lifetime thinking I\u2019d never know any blood relatives, when she\u2019d been there all along.\nShe and I still haven\u2019t talked talked; we\u2019re yet to meet in person. She was kind when we wrote to each other, but overwhelmed and unsure how to feel. I understand; we all feel different emotions about the past and where we\u2019re from.\nAnd I\u2019m so lucky to have an amazing family who I love more than anything in the world. In time, I hope she and I will connect properly. For now, I\u2019m just comforted by knowing she was, and is, part of my world.",

        "content": "The technology is already enabling consultants to work at multiple sites at once, saving vital time\nHundreds of premature babies could be saved by using new technology trialled during the pandemic that will allow doctors to treat them remotely, leading doctors say.\nTelemedicine \u201crobots\u201d that enable consultants to make bedside video calls have been used at Liverpool Women\u2019s and Alder Hey children\u2019s hospitals to treat sick babies.\nNow the head of the hospitals\u2019 neonatal unit is putting together plans to use the Teladoc devices, so that specialists can use their expertise to help teams at smaller hospitals treat children, even in emergencies.\nDr Chris Dewhurst, the clinical director of the Liverpool Neonatal Partnership, said: \u201cThis definitely has the potential to save the lives of extremely preterm infants who were born outside of specialist centres, and improve their outcomes.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve demonstrated is that it\u2019s easy to use, it improves the quality of care for babies and their families, improves the speed of review, and it is very close to being there in person.\u201d\nThe device, which sits on a mobile frame, has cameras, a screen and even a stethoscope, and can also link to MRI scanners and thermal-imaging cameras. It allows a consultant watching from elsewhere to view a patients\u2019 medical records on the spot.\nDewhurst and his team began using two of the devices in March 2020. \u201cWe lost seven of our 14 consultants due to shielding or isolation \u2013 40% of the time available for clinicians to be in hospital. It [the robot] kept us going.\u201d\nOn some occasions, using the robots was better than being there in person, because the device has a camera on a boom that can be placed above the baby to show what\u2019s happening, he said. \u201cIf I was there in person, I wouldn\u2019t be able to see that because there were people around the baby.\u201d\nAbout 90,000 babies a year in England need some sort of specialist care after they are born. There are 54 Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs) such as the one in Liverpool that treat the most serious cases of premature babies and those with serious conditions. Another 83 hospitals have Local Neonatal Units (LNUs) that offer short-term intensive care. And there are 44 Special Care Baby Units for monitoring the least serious cases.\nDoctors try to identify which foetuses might require help after birth, but that is not always possible, and 9,523 babies needed to be transferred between hospitals at least once in 2015, according to figures from the National Neonatal Audit Programme compiled by Bliss, the charity for babies born sick or prematurely.\n\u201cFor babies who are extremely preterm, and have not been able to move into an NICU, then they\u2019re not going to be looked after by people with the specialist skills. And we know that those babies have worse outcomes,\u201d Dewhurst said.\nHe is bidding for funding for the devices in hospitals with SCBUs so that clinical teams can call on specialist advice quickly.\n\u201cWe now need to find the funding so that babies who were born in other hospitals who need immediate intervention can have an neonatologist there immediately, within minutes, rather than them not being there at all, because they\u2019re 40 to 50 miles away.\u201d\nA similar system has been run by the Mayo clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, where neonatologists support teams at 19 regional hospitals.\nDr Jennifer Fang, medical director for the Mayo Clinic\u2019s teleneonatology programme, said that only babies in a critical condition needed to be transferred, and fewer parents had to go through the stress of being separated from their babies.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve observed is that the odds of a baby needing a transfer to a higher level of care or transfer to a hospital with an NICU are reduced by anywhere from 30 to 50%,\u201d she said.\nWith difficult births or injuries to babies during birth, the Mayo specialists have a target to be on hand for remote consultations within five minutes.\nBefore the programme, the clinic was involved in birth-injury lawsuits about every eight to nine months, Fang said. \u201cNow that our programme\u2019s in place, we haven\u2019t had a single birth-injury case for the last eight years.\u201d\nA study by the clinic showed that having neonatologists involved remotely meant that clinical teams in smaller hospitals were less likely to be overwhelmed by the complexity of dealing with a sick baby. Babies were more likely to have checks on temperature, breathing and glucose levels.\nJonathan Patrick of Consultant Connect, which supplied the robots, said the devices could be used in other circumstances. \u201cIt allows you to have access to clinicians, for example, who have retired but still want to be part of the workforce, yet can\u2019t go to hospital every day.\u201d\nA trial is underway at University Hospitals Leicester NHS Trust where consultants doing elective surgery are often split across two sites. Dr Steve Jackson, who is running the trial, said that consultants on different sites could dial in to a consultation and discuss the case on the spot rather than doing separate ward rounds.",

        "content": "Most of the resources the NHS is devoting to Covid in hospital are being spent on people who have not had their jab\nIn hospital, Covid-19 has largely become a disease of the unvaccinated. The man in his 20s who had always watched what he ate, worked out in the gym, was too healthy to ever catch Covid badly. The 48-year-old who never got round to making the appointment.\nThe person in their 50s whose friend had side-effects. The woman who wanted to wait for more evidence. The young pregnant lady worried about the effect on her baby.\nThe 60-year-old, brought to hospital with oxygen saturations of 70% by the ambulance that he initially called for his partner, who had died by the time it arrived; both believed that the drug companies bribed the government to get the vaccine approved.\nAll severely ill with Covid. All unvaccinated and previously healthy. All completely avoidable.\nOf course, there are people who have their vaccinations but still get sick. These people may be elderly or frail, or have underlying health problems. Those with illnesses affecting the immune system, particularly patients who have had chemotherapy for blood cancers, are especially vulnerable. Some unlucky healthy people will also end up on our general wards with Covid after being vaccinated, usually needing a modest amount of oxygen for a few days.\nBut the story is different on our intensive care unit. Here, the patient population consists of a few vulnerable people with severe underlying health problems and a majority of fit, healthy, younger people unvaccinated by choice. Watching the mix of patients coming in with Covid, it feels to me like hardly anybody has been vaccinated nowadays; of course, this is because the people that have been vaccinated are getting on with their lives at home. If everyone got vaccinated, hospitals would be under much less pressure; this is beyond debate. Your wait for your clinic appointment/operation/diagnostic test/A&E department would be shorter. Your ambulance would arrive sooner. Reports of the pressure on the NHS are not exaggerated, I promise you.\nFurthermore, we have recently rolled out a new medication for patients without antibodies against Covid. It costs about \u00a32,000 a treatment and is subject to a rigorous and time-consuming approval process for every case we treat. Guess which patients don\u2019t have these antibodies (spoiler: it\u2019s not the ones who have been vaccinated).\nMost of the resources that we are devoting to Covid in hospital are now being spent on the unvaccinated.\nYes, vaccinations are unpleasant. They cause side-effects. They hurt. You may even still catch Covid afterwards. I have many colleagues who have felt awful after vaccination and a few who had to take a day or two off work. However, I have not heard of any who have been hospitalised with Covid afterwards or who have had severe side-effects. The approvals process was incredibly stringent and we now have an unbelievable amount of real-world data that these vaccines work. The science that has been applied here is nothing short of awe-inspiring to me. However, I realise that none of these rational arguments would change the mind of someone who is resolved against having it, although I suppose it may push someone who remains undecided.\nAs a respiratory doctor, I have spent my whole career treating people whose lung diseases have been caused by smoking, including long after they knew the risks. I have spent countless hours with people who blame themselves for ruining their health; I have thought a lot about our personal responsibility for our health and to what degree we should be held accountable for our choices. I personally \u2013 unlike some of my colleagues \u2013 have never felt any ambivalence about treating smokers without judgment in exactly the same way as people with diseases that are not seen as self-inflicted.\nEnshrined in the way we protect patients\u2019 autonomy is the recognition that others may reasonably make decisions we may see as irrational or wrong. We are all products of our upbringing, education and opportunities, and I have been hugely fortunate that in my case these have led me to make decisions I value. Who is to say I wouldn\u2019t have made different choices in someone else\u2019s shoes.\nTranslating this to the choice not to take the vaccine, however, I find my patience wearing thin. I think this is for a number of reasons. Even if you are not worried about your own risk from Covid, you cannot know the risk of the people into whose faces you may cough; there is a dangerous and selfish element to this that I find hard to stomach.\nSome of my frustration is directed upwards, at the flagrant misinformation flourishing in certain places and the utterly woeful example that our leaders continue to set. I have never heard a reason not to take the vaccine that I have agreed with. Most of all, however, I am now beaten back, exhausted, worn down by the continuous stream of people that we battle to treat when they have consciously passed up the opportunity to save themselves. It does make me angry.\nDespite this, I find the idea of NHS and care staff being forced to be vaccinated very difficult. I know that it is the right outcome, but I dislike the means of bringing it about. It is incredible to me that there is so much anxiety and falsehood around that this could possibly be necessary after the year we have all witnessed. How strong is the hold that this information has on people that it outweighs rational thought?\nMaybe it\u2019s just that others have not seen what I have recently, or do not believe it, but even now we have nurses on our Covid ward who have not been vaccinated. I just hope that we don\u2019t end up losing yet more staff.\nFundamentally though, for me, it comes down to this. I can\u2019t think of a single case offhand of a person who was previously fit and healthy who has ended up needing intensive care after being fully vaccinated. It may not stop you from catching Covid. But it can save your life when you do.\nThe writer is an NHS respiratory consultant who works across a number of hospitals",

        "content": "Progressive former student leader Gabriel Boric and far-right Jos\u00e9 Antonio Kast are neck-and-neck ahead of Sunday\u2019s first round\nVoters in Chile head to the polls on Sunday in a general election in which the two frontrunners for president offer starkly contrasting visions for the country\u2019s future after two years of street protests and political unrest.\nPolls suggest that the progressive former student leader Gabriel Boric, 35, and the far-right candidate, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Kast, are neck-and-neck ahead of five other candidates \u2013 though neither seems likely to cross the 50% threshold needed to avoid a December runoff.\nBoric, who shot to prominence during Chile\u2019s 2011 education protests, has promised to \u201cbury\u201d Chile\u2019s past as a cradle of neoliberalism imposed under the dictator Gen Augusto Pinochet, and pledges to build a fairer Chile marked by inclusivity, diversity and liberal social values.\nKast, 55, is a staunch Catholic who opposes abortion and rails against the \u201cgay lobby\u201d \u2013 and a proud supporter of the Pinochet dictatorship. A perennial fringe figure in Chilean politics, he has earned support among those who believe Chile needs a firm hand on the rudder after its most turbulent period in decades.\n\u201cWe are fighting to create a state that guarantees rights and dignity,\u201d Boric told a crowd in the city of Casablanca as he closed his campaign on Thursday evening.\nIn Santiago, Kast addressed his own supporters, saying: \u201cChile needs peace, order, and to go back to making progress with freedom.\u201d\nThe country has tumbled through two years of protests, which began when millions took to the streets in 2019 to voice their frustration at deep inequalities and Pinochet\u2019s lingering legacy of privatised social services.\nThe demonstrations eventually petered out amid coronavirus quarantines, but they prompted a landmark plebiscite which led to an assembly to rewrite Chile\u2019s constitution, which had been drafted without popular input under Pinochet.\n\u201cPeople will elect the president and congress who will accompany the constitutional process and the transformations undergoing society over the next four years,\u201d said Claudia Heiss, a political scientist at the University of Chile.\n\u201cWhoever is elected is going to take those first tentative steps through the transition of the political system.\u201d\nIn the most open field in years, the middle ground is contested by the centrist Yasna Provoste, the only female candidate and a member of the Diaguita indigenous group, and the centre-right Sebasti\u00e1n Sichel.\n\u201cThe centre is where the real battle is taking place,\u201d said Heiss. \u201cBoth Provoste and Sichel are competing for the moderate vote, which could eventually prove significant in drawing support away from the two frontrunners.\u201d\nSichel has enjoyed something of a resurgence in the week before the vote as Kast has made several blunders after an otherwise smooth campaign.\nAt a meeting with foreign correspondents a week before the elections, Kast bristled when asked about his team\u2019s fierce criticism of the \u201cfar-right\u201d tag he is routinely given.\nKast insisted that he should instead be termed a \u201ccommonsense\u201d candidate, but the event made headlines after he reiterated his support for Gen Pinochet\u2019s dictatorship.\nOther candidates include the cantankerous communist Eduardo Art\u00e9s, a primary schoolteacher, and Marco Enr\u00edquez-Ominami, a former socialist congressman. He keeps a low profile between elections and is now running for the presidency for a fourth time \u2013 having never made the second round.\nAnother candidate has spent the entire campaign in the United States. Businessman Franco Parisi, repeatedly delayed his return to the country as he has not paid his ex-wife significant sums in child support, which he would have to pay should he return.\nIf no candidate takes more than half of the vote on Sunday, a run-off next month between the two highest-placed candidates will decide who takes the reins from President Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era in March 2022.",

        "content": "Gay educators and their allies \u2013 including students and the ACLU \u2013 are fighting back\nWhen volleyball coach Inoke Tonga was called in for a meeting with the leadership of Valor Christian high school in Highlands Ranch, Colorado, this fall, he thought he was about to be offered a promotion.\nInstead, he was interrogated with a series of vague, leading questions that attempted to get him to admit he was gay.\nTonga had been out for years \u2013 and knew his contract never stated he couldn\u2019t be gay and teach at Valor \u2013 but shame-filled memories of his closeted years as a young man rose up in that moment, as his job slipped away.\n\u201cThey offered to help me stop being gay, with my \u2018struggle\u2019,\u201d Tonga says. \u201cThey said I should take my time to decide if I will accept their help, and they\u2019ll tell everyone I\u2019m on a spiritual journey.\u201d\nThe offer they made was for Tonga to attend some form of \u201cconversion therapy\u201d, and when he returned to announce he isn\u2019t gay, cut off contact with his fiance, scrub his social media of any support for the LGBTQ community, and denounce his support for them before the school.\n\u201cThey said a lot of parents pay a lot of money to go to Valor, just so their kids don\u2019t have to mentored by someone who is gay,\u201d he recalls.\nTonga declined their offer, and resigned.\nOutrage on the part of students, parents, alumni and allies over Tonga losing his job for being gay is part of a decades-long battle between anti-discrimination laws and the right of private Christian schools (of which there are approximately 34,500 in the US alone) to religious freedom.\nEver since the 1964 Civil Rights Act threatened the tax-exempt status of Christian schools who refused to racially integrate, religious schools in the US have tangled with social justice activists seeking equal protections for minority students and employees.\nIn 2020, the supreme court ruled employment protections in the Civil Rights Act should extend to LGBTQ+ employees, thereby federally outlawing termination of an employee for their sexual orientation or being transgender. But buried deep within the Civil Rights Act is an exception for religious institutions who want to discriminate against employees of a different faith.\n\u201cSo while a secular employer can\u2019t say, \u2018I\u2019m not going to hire you because you\u2019re Jewish, I only hire Catholics,\u2019 the Catholic school can say that, because they\u2019re exempt from the prohibition against religious discrimination,\u201d says Joshua Block, senior staff attorney with the ACLU\u2019s LGBT & Aids project. \u201cAnd religious schools have argued that that limited exception should be interpreted broadly to mean that I can discriminate against anyone based on my religious beliefs.\u201d\nCourts have, for the most part, been saying no to this argument, Block says.\nBut Tonga\u2019s story is far from an isolated incident \u2013 even at Valor Christian high school, where a lesbian teacher was pressured to leave under similar circumstances.\nEarlier this summer, music teacher Todd Simmons claimed he was fired from Our Lady\u2019s Catholic Academy in Queens, New York, after filling out health insurance forms that revealed he was married to a man. A nearly identical scenario involving a gay music teacher fired from a Catholic school played out only a short distance away at the same time.\nThe issue is further complicated in states like Florida \u2013 where the line between public school and private religious school is sometimes blurred. Steven Arauz, a sixth-grade history teacher, found himself fired from a Seventh Day Adventist school \u2013 which is publicly funded with $1m a year in tax dollars and credits \u2013 after he was featured in a Gay With Kids article where he discussed his adopted son.\n\u201cYou are aware that this conduct, if true, does not comport with the Seventh-day Adventist church\u2019s standards,\u201d he was told in an email that terminated his $49,000 a year position. \u201cHand over your keys. Hand over your badge. You\u2019re not allowed on Forrest Lake property.\u201d\nBlock and the ACLU have found some success litigating these firings.\nLast month, a federal judge ruled that the firing of the North Carolina teacher Lonnie Billard from a Catholic school for being gay was a violation of the Civil Rights Act, shutting down the school\u2019s attempt to argue that they had a religious exemption from the law.\n\u201cAfter all this time, I have a sense of relief and a sense of vindication. I wish I could have remained teaching all this time,\u201d Billard said in a statement released by the ACLU. \u201cToday\u2019s decision validates that I did nothing wrong by being a gay man.\u201d\nThe work of Block and the ACLU is standing on the shoulders of decades of litigation that provides civil rights legislation the legal muscle it has today. Much of this played out in public schools, particularly in the south, where segregationists like the Alabama governor, George Wallace, stood blocking the entrance of a school that black students sought to enter.\nAround this time, the marketplace for private religious schools \u2013 thought to be protected from integration laws \u2013 began to explode in size.\n\u201cHoping to keep their racial purity, their white evangelical identity, a lot of rich churches created their own schools,\u201d said Frances Fitzgerald, author of the Pulitzer prize\u2013winning book, The Evangelicals: The Struggle to Shape America. \u201cThey thought they could get away with being segregated.\u201d\nThis proved not to be the case when Bob Jones University \u2013 which gave Wallace an honorary degree \u2013 found itself stripped of its tax-exempt status as a religious institution due to its ban on black students.\nForced integration and taxation of private religious schools \u2013 along with bans on teacher-led prayer in public schools \u2013 created a narrative among conservative evangelicals that a liberal government was waging war on Christianity, galvanizing them into the political force known today as the Christian right.\n\u201cBefore this, they weren\u2019t terribly organized at all,\u201d Fitzgerald said of the previously apolitical demographic. \u201cWhen Paul Weyrich went around trying to enlist evangelicals and fundamentalists into the Republican party, they didn\u2019t respond to any of his issues other than forced integration of Christian schools.\u201d\nThis laid the groundwork for the following generation of evangelical leaders such as Jerry Falwell, Pat Robertson and Tim LeHay, who partnered with the Republican party to stir up anger around issues evangelicals previously cared little about, like abortion, drugs and the rights of women and gays.\nCampaigns to overturn gay rights legislation like \u201cSave Our Children\u201d in Florida (led by evangelical superstar Anita Bryant), or California\u2019s Prop 6, which sought to ban gay men and lesbians from teaching in public schools, both equated homosexuality with pedophilia and accused gay teachers of being sexually motivated in their career choice.\nWhile the villains were new, the tactic of ginning up baseless fears had been the cornerstone of white flight to Christian schools a decade earlier.\nBob Jones University\u2019s lack of black students was rooted in its ban on interracial dating. When the university eventually integrated in 1971, it allowed only married black students to attend, and in 1975 allowed single black students but denied \u201cadmission to applicants engaged in an interracial marriage or known to advocate interracial marriage or dating\u201d.\nWhile openly opposing racial integration eventually became an ineffective tool for galvanizing evangelical voters \u2013 replaced by racist dog-whistles \u2013 gays integrating themselves into the American family remained a potent touchstone for the Christian right.\n\u201cIn 2004, evangelical leaders were running out of money and their voters had been falling away, so they all got in a room together to decide what issues would bring their flock back to the fold, and they decided on gay marriage,\u201d says Fitzgerald. \u201cAnd so they flooded the nation with anti\u2013gay marriage ballot measures, and that not only helped get George W Bush elected to a second term, but the ballot measures sometimes performed better than he did \u2026 They were against gay people in principle, but they also thought gay teachers were a bigger threat to kids than anything.\u201d\n\u201cHe was awesome\u2013 he really cared,\u201d says Schuylar Daniel, a junior at Valor Christian high school, of his former volleyball coach, Tonga.\nOn a chilly November evening, Daniel was joined by dozens of classmates, alumni and LGBTQ activists outside a Valor high school football game, protesting against the treatment of Tonga. Cars honked their horns as they drove by, showing support with signs that read \u201cGod Is Love\u201d and \u201cEvery 45 seconds one queer teen attempts suicide.\u201d\nThis statistic comes from the Trevor Project, an advocacy group and crisis center for LGBTQ youth struggling with suicidal ideation. While the Christian right views gay teachers as a threat to students, the Trevor Project\u2019s research shows that \u201cLGBTQ youth who have access to an LGBTQ-affirming school report lower rates of attempting suicide.\u201d Yet, \u201conly half of LGBTQ youth reported having an LGBTQ-affirming school.\u201d\nSkyler Daniel and other students and alumni are laboring to make Valor an LGBTQ-affirming school through their organization, Valor for Change. Through their Gay Straight Alliance (which has to meet off campus) and a list of demands for school leadership, the group aims to make their school a place where all students can feel safe and supported.\nThe Guardian reached out to Valor high school to comment on Tonga and Valor for Change, but did not receive a response.\nWhile 81% of Americans say gay teachers should be able to teach at elementary schools, religious schools catering to the remaining 19% have been developing a varied strategy for keeping them out of their classrooms.\n\u201cThere are constitutional arguments they make, that [being forced to employ gay teachers] violates their freedom of association, free exercise of religion, but those have been rejected,\u201d says Joshua Block of the ACLU. \u201cOne thing that hasn\u2019t been rejected is the \u2018ministerial exception\u2019 [to discrimination laws] which is also grounded in the constitution. It says that there are certain positions that are so close to the exercise of an organization\u2019s religious identity that the government can\u2019t interfere with them.\u201d\nSo if Valor Christian high school wanted to say that because Inoke Tonga, for example, led his students in a prayer before a volleyball game, or spoke of the holy spirit guiding them during a game, could his firing for being gay fall under a ministerial exemption from discrimination laws?\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been tested at that level of specificity,\u201d says Block, \u201cbut a lot of religious organizations are trying to incorporate religious duties into the jobs of their employees to have that sort of insulation.\u201d\nProtecting religious freedom is at the core of America\u2019s history, identity and constitution. Over the course of the 20th century, many legal battles have been waged over when the freedom of an individual or persecuted minority should trump that of a religious institution\u2019s freedom to behave in any way their theology instructs.\nThere are a seemingly endless number of lines to be drawn on this issue, but for Block and the ACLU, the freedom to seek employment is essential to individual liberty.\nBlock said: \u201cIt is one thing to have a belief that you practice in your own religious community, but when you go out into the public market and start hiring people, you are engaging with the public at large, and you have to respect that there are a lot of people out there who deserve equal treatment, even if they don\u2019t share your religious beliefs.\u201d",

        "content": "Amid the economic upheaval of the pandemic it may seem counterintuitive that startups have reached unparalleled levels\nThere have been more new businesses formed so far this year than ever. Literally ever.\nA year ago I wrote about the surge in startups, 12 months later the trend has continued in a big way. According to data from the US Census Bureau analyzed by the Economic Innovation Group, there were about 1.4m new startup applications filed with the government through 30 September 2021. That\u2019s compared with 1.14m during the same period in 2020 and 987 thousand in 2019. Every year before had been significantly less.\n\u201cWith three months left in this unparalleled year, it now seems almost certain that the elevated pace of business formation in 2021 will be sufficient to surpass the record-breaking total of 2020,\u201d the researchers wrote.\nThe news will no doubt leave many with a case of the whys. Why would so many new businesses be formed in the wake (actually during) one of the biggest economic collapses in recent memory? Why would so many people be taking risks at a time when it seems to make more sense to gravitate towards the security of a big government and corporate job? Why would people want to start up a business in an era of economic and political uncertainty?\nAs with most big questions there\u2019s never just one answer. But as a student of small business I can say that there\u2019s certainly a few very specific reasons to explain what\u2019s going on.\nThe first has to do with need.\nThe rise in entrepreneurship isn\u2019t necessarily about the romantic notion of owning one\u2019s business or \u201cchanging the world\u201d as so many like to report. It\u2019s more real than that. It\u2019s because 22 million people became suddenly unemployed as a result of the pandemic. It\u2019s because 35 million people struggled to pay their rent and countless others could barely afford childcare. People like to talk about business ownership as a dream but for many during last year\u2019s economic downturn (which still unfortunately lingers), it was an economic necessity to do something to put food on the table. Which is why so many people sold products online, drove Ubers and became freelancers. People did this not to supplement their existing income but to provide income.\nThe second reason is capital.\nNever has capital been so widely available and so cheap. Thanks to the stock market surge and stimulus payments, household wealth has soared to historic highs. That means that people have more savings to invest in their startups. Interest rates \u2013 though likely to increase soon \u2013 have remained at historic lows throughout the past 10 years, providing an almost cost-free environment for investors and venture capitalists to risk their money.\nOther sources of financing \u2013 from merchant advances to crowdfunding to credit cards and online lending services \u2013 have offered a myriad of choices to the entrepreneur looking for cash. Technology \u2013 once a significant investment \u2013 has become so cheap that a single Etsy seller can look like and act like an international conglomerate. Websites offering free or low-cost tax advice, email, business formation services and legal services proliferate. The cost of starting up a business has never been cheaper and the capital needed to launch has never been as available.\nFinally, there are many new opportunities.\nFor someone wanting to start a business, there are many places to throw a hat in the ring. The data shows that accommodation and food services lead the pack in new business applications (a 75% increase from 2019) and when you think about the explosion of home sharing and rental platforms as well as delivery services does this come as any surprise?\nWhen you consider the explosion in work-from-home workers do you doubt that professional and administrative services startups have also jumped? Or that in the midst of a housing boom we\u2019re seeing more people jump into the construction field? Or that with supply chain challenges and the pleas for more drivers and space for all those online goods we\u2019re seeing a 74% jump in transportation and warehousing services? And you know all those corporate workers that complained before the pandemic of being so \u201cslammed\u201d and overworked? Turns out many of them had the time to start up online stores (retail trade is up 62%) on Etsy, eBay and Amazon while still holding down those same full-time jobs that were presumably keeping them so busy!\nAll of this is great, but let\u2019s not get too ahead of ourselves\nVery, VERY few of these new startups will actually become the next big thing. The vast majority will probably never have employees. But it\u2019s still good to see that so many people want to be independent. They want to not rely on a corporation for all of their income. They look for challenges and, in some cases, have a dream of building something that provides not just a job for themselves, but a livelihood for their families.\nDespite what we read about globalism, big government and corporate monopolies, entrepreneurism is still going strong in this country because the fundamental economic and political structure of our country makes the American dream still possible.",

        "content": "Forward is seemingly impossible to fit into a modern system and his signing symbolises a flaw holding back the club\nSo, what next? Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r has gone, and with him perhaps Manchester United\u2019s most visible problem, but a sentimental appointment wasn\u2019t the only issue holding the club back. United are institutionally dysfunctional and it will take more than a change of personnel in the dugout to change that.\nSolskj\u00e6r was a fine appointment as caretaker, perhaps the last good decision Ed Woodward made as United CEO. The return of a popular club legend, the sunshine man whose rays of decency could dispel the acrimony of the latter days of Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s reign, made sense. The problem was that rather than waiting until his short-term contract expired, Woodward gave him the job on a permanent basis.\nEven by the end of that season, as United won only two of their final 12 games, it was apparent a mistake had been made. Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s teams lacked the sophisticated organisation that differentiates the very best from the rest. The board could have made an assessment with the benefit of as much evidence as possible; instead they allowed themselves to be carried by emotion.\nThat lack of organisation was never resolved. Solskj\u00e6r could set up a team to defend deep and strike on the break, which brought a series of notable results in big games, but they struggled to break down well-organised defences. Of course, when you have a squad as loaded with talent as United\u2019s, you will score goals most of the time, but the draw at West Brom, the home defeat by Sheffield United, and perhaps most especially the draw against Villarreal in the Europa League final were indictments.\nThis season, the flaw was compounded by the signing of Cristiano Ronaldo, another nostalgia-driven investment, another reminder that United as a club see themselves as being less about the production of effective football than saleable content. This is a squad put together less for utility than celebrity.\nSuddenly it was no longer possible to sit deep and counter because there was a chugging goal-machine who had to be selected up front. With a great midfield, as Real Madrid showed with Casemiro, Luka Modric and Toni Kroos, it is (just about) possible to compensate for Ronaldo and his unwillingness or inability to press. Scott McTominay, Fred and Nemanja Matic do not constitute a great midfield.\nThe inertia of the United directors, their hope that everything would somehow come good, that a functioning team could somehow be constructed out of some famous people and some 1990s memes, means they have missed out on the best available candidate, Antonio Conte going the way of Thomas Tuchel and Mauricio Pochettino (when he joined Paris Saint-Germain). United\u2019s statement said they will appoint an interim manager until the end of the season. But then who? Zinedine Zidane, Pochettino, Brendan Rodgers, Julen Lopetegui? Would Laurent Blanc be up for it? Could Ralf Rangnick be persuaded to leave Lokomotiv Moscow and take over as sporting director?\nAnd that is probably the biggest issue. The United board might not be so susceptible to each passing tide if there were somebody there who grasped modern football. The most damaging aspect of the Solskj\u00e6r appointment was probably that it meant plans for a high-profile sporting director were shelved. John Murtough was appointed as football director in March but his visible impact has been minimal. With a figure who could guide the overall outlook there might be a coherence to signings, rather than a series of half-baked half-theories vaguely pursued before the allure of nostalgia and glamour takes over again.\nThis is a squad that has been expensively assembled, but it lacks coherence and whoever is appointed will have to face that first of all \u2013 and that means sales as well as signings. Why was Paul Pogba not offloaded when he might have generated a fee? It\u2019s not necessarily a criticism of them as players, but why are Donny van de Beek, Eric Bailly, Juan Mata, Alex Telles and Diogo Dalot at the club if there was no place for them in Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s plans? But the biggest problem is Ronaldo.\nIt\u2019s all very well him scoring late goals to salvage games against teams such as Villarreal and Atalanta, but why do those games need salvaging? Zidane left Real Madrid at the end of his final season there, since when Ronaldo has seen off Max Allegri, Maurizio Sarri and Andrea Pirlo before Solskj\u00e6r: that\u2019s five coaches in three and a half years across three clubs. How can he be fitted into a modern system? The truth is that, for all his goals, he probably can\u2019t. While he remains at the club, whoever the manager is will be compensating for his presence and that militates against an integrated philosophy.\nHis status dwarfs all else and that leads to a compunction, not to use him as an impact sub or only in matches in which United are likely to dominate the ball, but to play him in the majority of games. And the effect of that ripples out, reducing opportunities for Jadon Sancho (a \u00a373m signing this summer who has seemingly been sacrificed on the altar of Ronaldo), Mason Greenwood, Marcus Rashford, Anthony Martial, Jesse Lingard and Edinson Cavani.\nWhat United need, fairly obviously, is a coherent structure. They need to build a system that presses, that allows the team to function as a unit, both going forwards and backwards. But achieving that with this squad, with a board forever adding new gaudy accoutrements, is far from straightforward.\nAnd while the present situation is clearly filtered through a modern lens, the sense of frustration, of stars never quite making a constellation, has been, beyond the Busby and Ferguson eras, fairly standard at Old Trafford since the second world war. Only three managers have won the league with United. Without major changes throughout the club, it may be a long time before there\u2019s a fourth.",

I don\u2019t have the full facts.\u201d\nJavid made his comments as he announced the launch of a review into systemic racism and bias in medical devices to examine why people of colour and women have worse health outcomes.\nIn a partnership with Javid\u2019s US counterpart, the review will look at introducing new international standards to ensure medical devices have been tested on people of all races before they are allowed to be sold.\nJavid told Sky News\u2019s Trevor Philips on Sunday that Covid had highlighted health disparities.\n\u201cIf you were from a BME background, a third of admissions were from [a] BME background in ICU units at the height of the crisis, and that\u2019s more than double the representation of the population,\u201d he said.\nResearch shows devices such as oximeters, which estimate the amount of oxygen in a person\u2019s blood, work less effectively for patients with darker skin and could have contributed to thousands of unnecessary deaths during the pandemic.\n\u201cThere are research papers already on this and no one did anything about it,\u201d Javid said. \u201cNow, I\u2019m not saying this was deliberate by anyone, I think it\u2019s just it\u2019s a systemic issue potentially, with medical devices and it may go even further than that with medical textbooks, for example.\u201d\nWriting in the Sunday Times to announce the review, Javid said: \u201cIt is easy to look at a machine and assume that everyone\u2019s getting the same experience. But technologies are created and developed by people, and so bias, however inadvertent, can be an issue here too. So questions like who is writing the code, how a product is tested and who is sitting round the boardroom table are critical \u2013 especially when it comes to our health.\n\u201cThe pandemic has brought this issue to the fore, but the issue of bias within medical devices has been ducked for far too long. Although we have very high standards for these technologies in this country \u2013 and people should keep coming forward for the treatment they need \u2013 we urgently need to know more about the bias in these devices, and what impact it is having on the frontline.\u201d\nThe review would also focus on gender bias, covering, for example, how MRI scanners can be made accessible to pregnant or breastfeeding women, he said.\nJavid, who is the first UK health secretary of colour, will be working with Xavier Becerra, the first Latino to take on the role of US health secretary.\nThe launch of the review comes after Public Health England data showed that deaths from coronavirus among people of colour were two to four times greater than those among the white population in England, according to a paper in the Lancet.\nA report by the Labour peer Doreen Lawrence last year also found there were thousands of avoidable deaths during the pandemic and made 20 recommendations to improve patient care for marginalised communities.\nShe criticised the government for a lack of action since 2010, when the Marmot review found gaping health inequalities and recommended an urgent national strategy be implemented, including better training and clear government accountability for progress.",

The island will be off limits for tourists for a month.\nOn 21 October, several people on the island reported that volcanic emissions had caused sickness in their pets. \u201cOne day I suddenly noticed that my 10 cats were lying on the floor as if they had passed out,\u201d Stefania Lombardo told the Italian daily la Repubblica, \u201cand I wasn\u2019t feeling well either, I had difficulty breathing. They told me it was just a panic attack, then the doctors confirmed that the cause for the sickness was the exhalation of gases from the crater.\u201d\nLast month, referring to \u201cincreased degassing, temperatures and seismicity\u201d on the island, Marco Pistolesi, a volcanology professor at the University of Pisa, said, \u201cfor those who know the island, this has never been observed before\u201d.\nThe last eruption on Vulcano was more than 130 years ago and lasted from 2 August 1888 to 22 March 1890.\nThe Romans believed that the tiny island was the chimney of Vulcan, the god of fire.",

A fifth person remained missing.\nProvincial officials warned on Saturday that the rough weather was set to continue, with Environment Canada forecasting that a similar weather system was set to bring as much as 150mm of rain and 20cm of snow to parts of northern British Columbia.\nThe storm was forecast to turn south on Sunday, potentially resulting in heavy rains in some of the storm-affected areas, said the province\u2019s public safety minister, Mike Farnworth. \u201cI urge people to pay close attention to weather warnings, given the unpredictability that comes with climate change,\u201d he added.\nLast week\u2019s storm came less than six months after the western Canadian province suffered record-high temperatures that killed more than 500 people and fuelled to wildfires that gutted an entire town.\nThe summer wildfires, which were blamed on the climate crisis, had magnified the risk of landslides, Thomas Martin, a forester in the province, recently told the Guardian. \u201cIf you burn a lot of the trees, grass and shrubs, there are fewer living things to intercept the water. It just flows directly off the hill. And fires can make the soil hydrophobic so the runoff increases even more.\u201d\nOn Saturday, about 14,000 people from several communities in the province remained under evacuation orders. Residents in some areas were subject to temporary restrictions on fuel and non-essential travel, resulting in reports of long queues at gas stations.\nThe restrictions were aimed at easing tensions in the supply chain after the storm forced the closure of the Trans Mountain pipeline and cut two key rail lines that lead to Vancouver, Canada\u2019s busiest port.\nFarnworth called on residents in affected areas to limit their movement until 1 December by avoiding travel, working from home where possible and taking public transport. \u201cOver the next 10 days we know that we have enough gas for essential vehicles and everyone else who needs it, if we are prudent and conserve where we can,\u201d he said.\nFederal officials said on Sunday that 500 members of the armed forces had been sent to the affected area to aid with tasks that ranged from evacuating stranded motorists to rescuing livestock from flooded farms. Exemptions had also been made to allow residents of the province to cross into the US for food or fuel and re-enter Canada without a Covid-19 test or quarantine.\nIn Abbotsford, one of the municipalities that was hardest hit by the storm, crews were scrambling to patch up a 100-metre breach in a key dyke as forecasts said there could be 100mm of rain on Tuesday.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a concern, especially with the weakened dykes,\u201d said the mayor of Abbotsford, Henry Braun. \u201cIf there\u2019s 100 millimetres of rain, if it comes in 24 hours that\u2019s a big problem. If it comes over three or four days, maybe we\u2019ll be OK.\u201d\nOn Sunday afternoon Braun said the breach in the dyke had been sealed but that crews were still working to build it back to its full height.\nThe dyke is key to protecting Sumas Prairie, a low-lying expanse of fertile land created almost a century ago by the draining of a lake and which is now a major hub of Canadian agriculture.\nThe storms battered the area, engulfing barns and felling power lines into the flood waters. On Saturday, Braun said that some farms continued to grapple with rising waters, pointing to one example where waters had risen eight inches overnight. \u201cThere\u2019s still 2,500 cows in that corner, dairy cows, and [the farmers] are worried.\u201d\nThe storm had devastated farmlands, the country\u2019s minister of emergency preparedness, Bill Blair, told reporters on Sunday. \u201cWe know that tens of thousands of animals, including entire herds and flocks, have been lost.\u201d\nChicken farmer Dave Martens was among the many who were ordered to evacuate earlier this week, doing so after frantically moving half of his birds to drier land. Soon after his farm was sitting under six feet of water.\n\u201cForty-thousand birds have died in my barn,\u201d Martens told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. \u201cIt\u2019s not just water. It\u2019s dead animal carcasses. You\u2019ve got faeces. Diesel gas. Other contaminants floating around. This is all permeating, getting into our houses. Everything that\u2019s down there is destroyed.\u201d \nBritish Columbia\u2019s agriculture minister, Lana Popham, said the province was coordinating efforts to get supplies and veterinarians to the animals, with four tonnes of feed airdropped on Saturday to as many as 5,000 hogs in the area. She estimated that the province had secured enough feed to last \u201cfive to six\u201d days.\n\u201cI think everyone understands it\u2019s all hands on deck,\u201d she added.",

        "content": "Two wins from four this autumn is a credible return given the amount of players missing for the Six Nations champions \nIn the end, as so often these days, it was all about the cards. Wales emerge from their autumn with two wins from four, a more than credible return given the players they had missing, but both wins \u2013 not for the first time in Wales\u2019s year \u2013 were at best qualified and at worst facilitated by early red cards against the opposition.\nAustralia were further hampered by a yellow card in that first half for a deliberate slap-down by Kurtley Beale, in whose absence Wales scored the only try of their own construction. Meanwhile, Wales\u2019s other try was scored by Nick Tompkins in the second half after, wait for it, a deliberate slap-down.\nAn angry Dave Rennie, the coach of Australia, described the refereeing as \u201chorrendous\u201d, drawing out those two incidents for particular comment. The difference was that Tompkins\u2019s knock-down went backwards, just, but it is yet another quirk in the laws of a sport that is simply impossible to referee to everyone\u2019s satisfaction \u2013 or even, it seems a lot of the time, anyone\u2019s.\nWales came away with another win by hook or by crook \u2013 although no one, again, was trying to argue that Rob Valetini, the latest to see red, was in any way being a crook. After he clashed heads with Adam Beard while tackling him, he left the field to the usual chorus of sympathies citing a lack of malice. Rugby remains the only sport to send players off for, at worst, failures of technique. The torturous trials of officialdom follow naturally. You make your bed \u2026\nThere is no doubt Wayne Pivac\u2019s pillow is fluffier than it might be, due to those two red cards that left first Fiji and now Australia understaffed for most of the match. All three Australian tries were handsome affairs constructed on the Wallabies\u2019 terms, the first with a full complement in the third minute, the second with 14 against 14 following Gareth Thomas\u2019s yellow on the hour for a clear-out that on another day in the current climate might have been red, and the third, in the last 10 minutes, with Australia a man short. Wales will know that, by that measure, they were outplayed.\nBut finding a way to win is no mean skill, whatever the circumstances. And Wales\u2019s circumstances have been as compromised as anyone\u2019s by a lack of experienced personnel. They have hundreds of caps\u2019 worth sidelined with various ailments. The emergence of players such as Taine Basham and Ben Carter, the 20-year-old lock who replaced Beard, are genuine boons to Welsh hopes, as is the rehabilitation of Ellis Jenkins after his three years out with injury.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve learned a lot about players each week,\u201d said Pivac. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s so pleasing to get this result with the side that finished up on the field. There are so many good stories here in terms of the development side of things. The depth chart is looking a little bit better than it was at the start of this campaign.\u201d",

        "content": "As Labour leader journeys north again the task of building a new narrative has only just begun\nIt is a cold night on a Stoke-on-Trent industrial estate and Keir Starmer is in town again. It\u2019s at least his seventh trip here in search of redemption after Labour\u2019s historic defeat in 2019, in a sign of how important he sees the Potteries to the party\u2019s future.\n\u201cI feel I\u2019m getting to know Stoke quite well,\u201d he tells me. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll keep on coming. I think it\u2019s very, very important. The sort of discussion we want to have tonight is not a discussion we could have in London. You\u2019ve got to have it where people live, in their place, in their town, about the issues that matter to them.\u201d\nFlanked by his shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, the Labour leader has gathered a group of about 30 voters of all political stripes in a warehouse on an industrial estate in Newcastle-under-Lyme, on the outskirts of the city.\nThere is a mix of young and old from all walks of life, sitting clustered around workbenches in a room usually used for teaching apprentice bricklayers. Only today the lesson is about rebuilding the old \u201cred wall\u201d of former stronghold seats across the north and Midlands, starting with Stoke at its heart.\nThere is a danger that this could be yet another focus-grouped postmortem of the 2019 election. But there is growing frustration to build on as well, as Boris Johnson\u2019s levelling-up promises unravel to nothing, living costs go through the roof, and the stench of cronyism clings to the Conservatives.\nIn a show of hands orchestrated by Deborah Mattinson, Starmer\u2019s pollster (who knows a thing or two about Stoke), just two people think Britain\u2019s economy will be stronger in six months\u2019 time. No one thinks things will improve for Stoke.\nDawn, a secondary school teacher who has taught kids in the area for 30 years, sums up the sense of pessimism: \u201cIt\u2019s kind of \u2018Stoke\u2019s a dump, isn\u2019t it, Miss? I\u2019ll have to work hard to get out, Miss?\u2019 And you want to say, no you can generate a good living here as well.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a big gap between the haves and the have nots, she says. Some of her students don\u2019t have their own bed. \u201cWe talked about our town centre and the idea that you know, you get into Hanley, and you think, \u2018This is a poverty-stricken city.\u2019\u201d\nStoke is a place I know well, as a regular visitor for most of my life. I grew up an hour north up the M6 in Warrington, but there were regular journeys to my grandma\u2019s in Leek, the Staffordshire town my dad is from, as well as innumerable ups (Premier League promotion), downs (too many to mention), and cold, rainy nights following him as a Stoke City supporter.\nClearly there have been better days in the city of six disparate towns, where its world-famous ceramics industry once employed half the local workforce near its peak in 1938, before decades of industrial decline set in.\nBut there are great strengths too, with the potteries still providing skilled jobs and tourism, albeit for far fewer people, at firms like Emma Bridgewater and Burleigh. Major companies like JCB, Michelin and Jaguar Land Rover are investing in the area, while the online gambling company Bet365 \u2013 started by the local Coates family, who also own Stoke City \u2013 employ thousands.\nStill, Stoke was hit hard by Covid-19, having entered the emergency in a weaker position after a decade of austerity. Debt problems rose sharply, while those at the Labour town hall say there are few job opportunities for young people, a lack of training provision for technical careers, little support for small businesses, and soaring living costs.\nIt\u2019s fertile ground for Labour. \u201cIn Stoke and across the country, there is a growing cost-of-living crisis going on at the moment,\u201d Reeves tells me.\u201cI think you\u2019ll be wondering why the government are increasing taxes, reducing universal credit and allowing prices to get out of control and doing very little to fix those problems.\u201d\nInflation is at the highest level in a decade thanks to soaring energy costs, with the average family expected to lose \u00a31,000 next year. After a decade of Tory government, households are forecast to have a disposable income barely any higher in 2025 than they did in 2008. Meanwhile petrol prices hitting a record high is disproportionately felt here, in a city where public transport is poor.\nTesting out their ideas for the economy, Reeves and Starmer say they would cut VAT for household energy bills, insulate homes to keep down heating costs, and put a focus on buying more British goods. It\u2019s part of a listening exercise Starmer says will inform policies for the next election. \u201cYour fingerprints could be on something we\u2019ve talked about today,\u201d he tells the audience.\nThe plans, although fairly vague, draw a positive response. But some worry that the costs of insulating their homes will fall on ordinary people. \u201cI struggle to heat my home and keep the mould out. Council houses aren\u2019t warm enough,\u201d says Tracy. \u201cBut taxes are high enough already. It\u2019ll take food off our children.\u201d\nThere is a big focus on fairness, with the room united in annoyance at Amazon while countless shops are boarded up across the city. \u201cWe all buy from Amazon, let\u2019s be honest,\u201d says David. \u201cBut everybody says \u2018Why are they paying no taxes?\u2019\u201d\nSmall shops might have suffered in the city, but Stoke has seen a boom in old industrial land along the A500 converted into vast warehousing and logistics sites. Figures published this year showed the city was enjoying among the fastest jobs recoveries in Britain, a point heralded by the local Conservative council leader.\nWages are rising fast in the logistics sector amid nationwide staff shortages. Still, Mark Gregory, visiting professor of business economics at Staffordshire University, which has its main campus in Stoke, says it\u2019s hard to imagine that low-skilled warehouse jobs might drive an economic renaissance: \u201cIt seems unlikely that wage growth will outstrip inflation. The logistics piece will help a bit of the local economy but whether thats widespread seems unlikely.\u201d\nWith an ageing population, a higher share of public sector jobs and universal credit claimants than elsewhere, the city is being hit hard, he says. \u201cWith the cost of living, Stoke is going to be right in the firing line.\u201d\nReeves argues that the chancellor Rishi Sunak\u2019s budget last month lacked the substance to tackle inflation hitting families hard, while the Tories cut benefits and are poised to raise national insurance taxes on workers.\n\u201cPeople in Stoke are paying probably the highest taxes ever paid for 70 years,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think people have ever had to pay so much and get so little in return. Because so many public services are a breaking point.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a powerful argument that the Tories will not only break their levelling-up pledges, but that public funds will be spent unwisely; with high levels of tax, low growth and continuing regional inequality the only visible outcomes.\nThe problem for Labour, so far, is that the opposition has looked like it wouldn\u2019t do much better.\nHowever, in what was the ground zero of Labour\u2019s 2019 defeat, Starmer is aiming to start building a message he hopes may change the narrative. \u201cWe\u2019ve changed very much,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re very determined and focused on places like this, and the Conservative party in my view is going backwards.\u201d",

But an alternative method of computing is advancing rapidly, and Boris Johnson is among the people who have noticed. He will need to push the boundaries of his linguistic dexterity to explain it.\nQuantum computing is based on quantum physics, which looks at how the subatomic particles that make up the universe work. Last week, the prime minister promised the UK would \u201cgo big on quantum computing\u201d by building a general-purpose quantum computer, and secure 50% of the global quantum computing market by 2040. The UK will need to get a move on though: big steps have been taken in the field this year by the technology superpowers of China and the US.\nPeter Leek, a lecturer and quantum computing expert at Oxford University, says \u201cclassical\u201d computing (the common term for computing as we know it) has been an incredible 20th-century achievement, but \u201cthe way we process information in computers now still doesn\u2019t take full advantage of the laws of physics as we know them\u201d.\nWork on quantum physics, however, has given us a new and more powerful way of processing information. \u201cIf you can use the principles of quantum physics to process information then you can do a range of types of calculations that you cannot do with normal computers,\u201d says Leek.\nClassical computers encode their information in bits \u2013 represented as a 0 or a 1 \u2013 that are transmitted as an electrical pulse. A text message, email or even a Netflix film streamed on your phone is a string of these bits. In quantum computers, however, the information is contained in a quantum bit, or qubit. These qubits \u2013 encased in a modestly sized chip \u2013 are particles such as electrons or photons that can be in several states at the same time, a property of quantum physics known as superposition. This means qubits can encode various combinations of 1s and 0s at the same time \u2013 and compute their way through vast numbers of different outcomes.\n\u201cIf you compared a piece of memory in a normal computer, it is in a unique state of ones and zeroes, ordered in a specific way. In a quantum computer that memory can be simultaneously in all possible states of ones and zeroes,\u201d says Leek.\nTo really harness this power requires an \u201centanglement\u201d of pairs of qubits: if you double the number of qubits the computing power increases exponentially. Link these entangled qubit pairs together and you get a very powerful computer that can crunch through numbers at unprecedented speed, provided there is a quantum algorithm (the set of instructions followed by the computer) for the calculation you want to do.\nJay Gambetta, a VP of quantum computing at IBM, which last week unveiled the world\u2019s most powerful quantum processor, says: \u201cThe combined system has a computational power that is much more than the individual systems.\u201d The computer firm\u2019s US-made Eagle quantum processor \u2013 a type of computer chip \u2013 strings together 127 qubits compared with the 66 achieved recently by the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in Hefei.\nGambetta stresses that the practical applications of quantum computers are not there yet, but theoretically they could have exciting uses like helping design new chemicals, drugs and alloys. Quantum computing could result in a much more efficient representation of chemical compounds, says Gambetta, predicting accurately what a complex molecule might do and paving the way for new drugs and materials. \u201cIt gives us a way to model nature better,\u201d he adds.\nThere are ways in which quantum computing could help combat global heating, too, says Gambetta, by more efficiently separating carbon dioxide into oxygen and carbon monoxide, reducing the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. Alternatively, quantum computing could help understand how we can make fertiliser by using much less energy.\nLast year, IBM teamed up with German carmaker Daimler, the parent of Mercedes-Benz, to use quantum computing to model new lithium batteries. Renewable energy, pharmaceuticals, electric cars, fertiliser: if these are just some of the products that can be enhanced by quantum computing, then the UK understandably wants to be at the forefront of the market.\nOnce quantum computing reaches the 1,000 qubit level it should be able to achieve what IBM calls \u201cquantum advantage\u201d, where a quantum computer consistently solves problems faster than a classical computer. IBM is hoping to reach 1,000 qubits via its Condor processor in 2023.\nThe UK\u2019s strong university system \u2013 and long history of innovation, epitomised by Alan Turing in computing and Paul Dirac in quantum mechanics \u2013 gives the country some hope of achieving Johnson\u2019s goal. But Gambetta\u2019s IBM colleague Bob Sutor says that for the UK and other countries ambitious in making advances in quantum computing, educations and skills are key \u2013 at university level and below, including schools. \u201cThe more people working on it, the faster we will get there.\u201d",

        "content": "Making a clean break from the past and cutting the Ronaldo cord are also crucial after Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s departure\nManchester United\u2019s Premier League peers have achieved success through different means. Manchester City were purpose-built for Pep Guardiola, with Txiki Begiristain and Ferran Soriano in place as executives before his arrival. J\u00fcrgen Klopp is the frontman at Liverpool but works in tandem with Michael Edwards, a sporting director who has occasionally overruled the German on transfers. Edwards will be succeeded by his deputy, Julian Ward, this summer.\nChelsea have embraced chaos in multiple managerial sackings while winning titles and the Champions League twice in the past decade but have the structure to withstand the turbulence, their back office run expertly by Marina Granovskaia.\nUnited\u2019s structure beyond the manager has been amorphous since Sir Alex Ferguson retired. Each of his four successors have departed as isolated figures, with David Moyes, Louis van Gaal and Jos\u00e9 Mourinho complaining of a lack of support and self-determination. Ed Woodward has normally taken the blame, but United insiders will tell you that the co-owner Joel Glazer ultimately makes the big decisions. Woodward is set to depart in January, though it is reported he may retain a consultancy role.\nJohn Murtough was appointed in March as football director, with Darren Fletcher technical director. United sources suggest this eases the transition process for the new manager, but there are sincere questions over how much that duo can influence the bigger picture. The time sourcing a new manager must also be spent finessing the relationship between Florida and the training ground at Carrington.\nMichael Carrick\u2019s role as interim-before-the-interim manager serves as a reminder that it was 15 years ago in July that United signed him as the last player to actually improve their midfield. Marouane Fellaini, Morgan Schneiderlin and Bastian Schweinsteiger are among a rogues\u2019 gallery of midfield misfits bought in since.\nFred and Scott McTominay are targeted for mockery but it is tempting to think Ferguson might have made useful squad players of them. They are not, though, the calibre of their counterparts at Liverpool, City and Chelsea, particularly as a pairing. United, having spent heavily on the defence and attack in recent years, must source at least two high-class midfielders if they wish to be able to control matches. Too often in Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s regime they found the centre of the park dominated by purportedly lesser opponents.\nCristiano Ronaldo now appears a vanity purchase, with a record of won five, drawn two and lost seven since his September return, though it might be argued that the only bright spots of United\u2019s season have been spectacular Ronaldo goals such as those against Villarreal, Atalanta and Tottenham.\nIf this season is written off as an extended job search, then it should be used as a victory lap for Ronaldo while another home is found for him. He will be 37 in February and few serious managers would appreciate having to shoehorn such a player into modern pressing tactics. Losing him may affect the club\u2019s marketability and share price but a continued run of failure would be far more damaging in the long term. Ronaldo is no longer a player to build a future around but his exit can be eased, and probably milked financially too.\nIt was reported Solskj\u00e6r used Eric Cantona\u2019s \u201cwhen the seagulls follow the trawler\u201d line when speaking to Watford\u2019s manager, Claudio Ranieri, after the defeat on Saturday. That was the latest in a long line of cringe-making references to golden days long lost at United, and Solskj\u00e6r is by no means the only one trying to relive history.\nFerguson\u2019s influence has regenerated in recent years. The power vacuum at the club has allowed that but Ferguson will be 80 on New Year\u2019s Eve and even he would recognise that his United regime succeeded only once it stepped out of the shadow of Sir Matt Busby. Liverpool\u2019s recent successes came once the club modernised and decided to treat past glories as happy memories rather than a blueprint.\nAt the heart of United\u2019s problems lie the sense that the club is less focused on football than acting as a content provider and marketing tool. When Phil Lynch, the club\u2019s CEO of media, spoke last month of \u201cfan sentiment graphs\u201d to gauge social media reactions to players it gave the impression of an institution lost in show business rather than the football business.\nWoodward has repeatedly stated the club\u2019s focus is on football but the club\u2019s activities have suggested the opposite.",

        "content": "Australia has the second highest rate of textile consumption per capita globally, but measures to address the issue are still in their infancy\nLast week, the Australian Fashion Council received a $1m grant to start working with industry to reduce the country\u2019s mountain of textile waste. It\u2019s a sum that pales in comparison with the money on offer for recycling other products, however, and it has left some in the industry feeling underwhelmed.\nJulie Boulton and Aleasha McCallion are project managers at the Monash Sustainable Development Institute and co-authors of a report about a circular T-shirt that was released in March this year. McCallion says the $1m grant, when compared to other waste streams, is further evidence that the fashion industry is \u201cconsistently overlooked and underestimated, both on economic value and on how the system touches every single person\u201d.\nThe grant, which will help establish the country\u2019s first national product stewardship scheme for textiles, is part of a $1bn plan to transform Australia\u2019s waste and recycling that was announced last year. At the time, $190m was earmarked for new infrastructure to recycle plastic, paper, tyres and glass, a figure that dwarfs the amount granted to fashion waste so far.\nKellie Hush, the acting CEO of the fashion council, says there is \u201ca long way to go obviously, but it\u2019s a great start to have the federal government on board and taking notice of the issue\u201d.\nThe issue being the 23kg of clothing the average Australian dumps in landfill each year \u2013 putting Australians in the unenviable position of being the second highest textile consumers in the world, per capita, behind the US. While it is possible to recycle clothing in Australia, the sector has very low rates of uptake thanks to a lack of infrastructure to collect, sort and recycle textiles.\nThe council will use the grant money to collaborate with industry stakeholders \u2013 including designers, retailers, manufacturers, charities and textile recyclers \u2013 to create three reports by March 2023. The first will look at data and material flow. The second will analyse global initiatives, policies and technologies promoting circularity in textiles. The third will make recommendations for how to move forward, including a roadmap to 2030 in line with National Waste Policy Action Plan targets.\nHush says the first stage is about collaborating with industry to investigate what\u2019s realistic. She says once the reports are written, \u201cwe\u2019ll have recommendations and I can assure you that some of those, or most of those, will require investment with the federal government and private enterprise to help us fund those programs\u201d.\nAlice Payne is an associate professor in fashion design at Queensland University of Technology and one of the experts who will shape the scheme. She says: \u201cThis is just the beginning of what will actually be a longer journey \u2026 this amount of funds is a way of bringing stakeholders together.\u201d She says they will build on existing work in scholarly literature and reports from around the world and tailor them to \u201cthe Australian context in consultation with Australian stakeholders\u201d.\nThese conversations will explore changes in design and manufacturing for durability, as well as charitable recycling and second-hand business models, the need for innovation and investment in recycling technology, and consumer education. For now, the focus is on industry and not on policy or legislative change.\nThe principles of a circular fashion industry are well established, but have recently been popularised by international non-profits like the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, which produces significant research and reports on circularity in fashion. According to the foundation, a circular fashion industry is one where clothes are designed to be recyclable and durable, so they can be worn more and repaired, and shared and resold until their end of life, when they are collected to be recycled or returned to the earth.\nMcCallion and Boulton drew on the work of the foundation to write their report on a circular t-shirt. \u201cWe should be looking to retrofit great examples from overseas to the Australian context and working together to advance the agenda as fast as possible,\u201d says McCallion. \u201cWe aren\u2019t reinventing the wheel.\u201d\nThey say there is evidence overseas that circularity works when you have industry collaboration alongside legislation and policy change.\nBoulton says: \u201cWe are five to 10 years behind what\u2019s been going on in the EU, France, the Netherlands, Germany. They\u2019re currently having these debates on labelling and banning textile waste \u2026 that\u2019s what we should be doing. It\u2019s silly to focus on locally made products, it\u2019s such a tiny part. We need to go further than product stewardship and we need government regulation to look at what is coming in and stop the bad stuff.\u201d\nThe European Union is currently working on legislation to manage and control textile waste. From 2023 all clothes and shoes sold in the EU will have colour-coded labels informing customers of the product\u2019s environmental impact. Under the European Commission\u2019s waste framework directive, member states will have to set up separate collections for textiles by 2025. Payne says whether or not this model is followed will be determined by \u201cconversations with councils as well as with state governments and the like. It might be part of it but it\u2019s something that will have to be determined in the group.\u201d\nAdrian Jones is the co-founder of BlockTexx, a technology company building Australia\u2019s first large scale textile recycling facility in Logan, Queensland. He also believes the government needs to set a legislative framework, because under voluntary codes businesses don\u2019t change.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve only seen significant change in France, the Netherlands and Denmark because governments have said we are moving towards an export ban, or a producer pay scheme or a consumer pay scheme, or a combination of all of the above. Then we\u2019ve seen significant growth of onshore chemical recycling.\u201d\nThe BlockTexx plant uses chemical recycling technology, which is preferred over mechanical as it produces a higher quality material that can be recycled again. In three years the plant should be processing 10,000 tonnes of textile waste annually. Jones says: \u201cIf you\u2019re going to solve the problem of textile waste, you have to do it at volume, you can\u2019t be artisanal.\u201d\nHe says the infrastructure required for large-scale recycling would cost \u201ctens of millions of dollars\u201d but it doesn\u2019t all need to come from government. To fund their new plant, BlockTexx raised $5.5m: $1m from the federal government, $1m from the Queensland government and $3.5m from private investment.\nEven so, he\u2019s glad the $1m grant has been awarded to the fashion council. \u201cI just hope it\u2019s well spent and doesn\u2019t produce a whole lot of research that says \u2018wouldn\u2019t it be good if we did something about textile waste?\u2019 We kind of know that.\u201d",

        "content": "Given the uncertainty surrounding Paine\u2019s fitness and form, an argument can be made the host nation may emerge stronger\nThe English are celebrating the prospect of an Australian cricket team in disarray with little more than a fortnight until the opening Ashes Test begins in Brisbane.\nIt is indisputable the scandal associated with Tim Paine\u2019s resignation as Test captain on Friday is divisive. It is a significant distraction, and it may cause a reshuffle in the team. But will it ultimately detract from Australia\u2019s performance?\nGiven the uncertainty surrounding Paine\u2019s fitness and form, an argument can be made the host nation may actually emerge from the scandal stronger for the series.\nThe fallout from the saga continued on Sunday when former Cricket Australia chairman David Peever responded to criticism from current chair Richard Freudenstein.\nThe latter has stated his administration would have removed Paine as skipper when the harassment incident was investigated in 2018 had it been in charge.\nIn a statement to News Corp, Peever responded by saying the wicketkeeper deserved Cricket Australia\u2019s loyalty and should not be \u201cabandoned at this time\u201d.\n\u201cCricket Australia\u2019s decision seems knee jerk and unfortunately shows double standards,\u201d Peever said.\n\u201cThe issue has been doing the rounds in cricket circles for some years now. The current chairman has been on the board for two years and it is implausible he didn\u2019t know about it.\n\u201cIf he and the board felt so strongly about it, why wait until now to act?\u201d\nFormer Victorian captain Darren Berry, a keeper of renown in his career, believes Paine should retain his position in the Test side. Former Australian opener Ed Cowan disagrees.\nThe contrasting views of the past and current Cricket Australia chairs, and those of former players, are indicative of a broader discussion.\nAmong the questions Cricket Australia and the selectors are considering is who will captain the Test side and whether Paine should hold the gloves for the Brisbane Test.\nThey must weigh whether the negative publicity and associated pressure caused by the scandal will affect the form of a player who has averaged 32.63 in 35 Tests.\nLast summer, Paine averaged 40.8 against India in a series Australia lost on home soil. It was a valuable contribution, despite the overall failure, and one that merits selection.\nBut the incumbent turns 37 on the first day of the Ashes. His age adds to his current vulnerability, based on the history of some of Australia\u2019s most decorated wicketkeepers.\nBrad Haddin was 37 when he was replaced by Peter Nevill after missing the second Test of the 2015 Ashes. Adam Gilchrist retired at a similar age in 2008. Ian Healy was 35. Rod Marsh was also 37 when his career ended.\nThat the Tasmanian has not played a first-class match since April and underwent surgery on a bulging disk that caused considerable neck and shoulder pain scarcely helps his cause.\nHe was due to return to the crease for the University of Tasmania on Saturday until rain hit.\nPaine\u2019s chances to demonstrate he retains a surety with the gloves and bat will be in a four-day game for Tasmania\u2019s second XI and an Australia A match in Brisbane starting 1 December.\nFreudenstein said Paine is available for selection. He is the only wicketkeeper named in the squad for the Ashes. But given the circumstances, a late change would not surprise.\nAlex Carey, at 30, shapes as the leading candidate should a change be made. He has a first-class average of 35.66 and has taken 156 catches, with four stumpings, in 44 matches.\nBoth Carey and Josh Inglis, another potential candidate aged 26 who averages 34.03 in first-class cricket, are also in the Australia A squad for Brisbane.\nThe respective batting averages of the incumbent and the hopefuls suggest not a lot will be lost should a change occur. But it is harder to gauge what the loss of Paine\u2019s leadership and experience would mean.\nAs to who should be Australia\u2019s next captain, Pat Cummins is clearly the leading candidate ahead of Steve Smith, whose presence will provide experience and a sounding board.\nHe carries the endorsement of Steve Waugh and Dennis Lillee, who declared him born to lead, and is regarded as a considered man who is clearly at the peak of his powers.\nThe 28-year-old would create history, at least in this century, for Australia has not had a fast bowler as captain since Ray Lindwall stood in for a Test against India in 1956.\nAny notion that fast bowlers cannot excel as captains is ludicrous. Bob Willis, Courtney Walsh and Shaun Pollock are among those to lead their nations with distinction.\nCummins has also demonstrated himself more than capable of fielding inside the ring.\nThis positions him close to the action, enabling him an ease of communication with his teammates and also the proximity to be guided by the nuances of the action unfolding.\nCummins shaped as a pivotal player in the Ashes. His role is now critical. It is a rare day when he has not delivered for his country. That may be enough to temper, to a degree, the enthusiasm of the English about this scandal.",

We are literally in a culture that is trying to turn it on the woman, make it her fault, blame her, accuse her of making it a political vendetta.\u201d\nAsked why she did not report the assault at the time, Nokes said: \u201cIf anyone said in 2003 that I should report it, my first question would be to who? How? What processes are there for me to make a complaint to the Conservative party about a fellow candidate? And I just didn\u2019t know that there were any and I think I would struggle to identify who to complain to now, to be brutally honest.\n\u201cBut I, like so many women, had that response of: how will this impact upon me? How will talking about this have a negative impact on me? And even 18 years later you can see people trying to turn it back on me, victim-blaming and shaming.\u201d\nNokes said she does not regard herself as a victim and refused to be painted as one.\nShe added: \u201cI really do think it\u2019s incumbent upon all of us to work together to call it out and to make sure that men who are behaving in this way understand that it\u2019s inappropriate.\u201d\nJohnson maintained he did not remember the incident and did not know who Nokes was. But the allegation prompted a second woman to come forward, Ailbhe Rea, a journalist for the New Statesman, who alleged he \u201cgroped\u201d her at the Tory conference in 2019.\nStanley Johnson told the Sun: \u201cI have no recollection of Caroline Nokes, and no idea what she was talking about. Had I been asked about the allegation made by the journalist of the New Statesman, I would have said the same thing.\u201d\nOn Thursday, the prime minister refused to say whether the Conservatives would launch an investigation.\nBoris Johnson told reporters: \u201cFirst of all, it\u2019s absolutely right that everybody, women in particular, should be able, should have the confidence, to come forward and make complaints.\n\u201cThere are proper procedures available for people to make their complaints, to make known what has happened and for those to be properly investigated.

        "content": "There was an era when managerial changes in Manchester were confined to the blue half, but on the day Pep Guardiola saw off Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r, he also claimed the scalp of a rather more decorated coach. Rafael Ben\u00edtez is the Champions League winner who has now gone six games without a victory. Instead, the Spaniard with the most to celebrate was Rodri, who delivered a stunning strike, and the Liverpool alumnus with much to savour was Raheem Sterling, who was lured to Anfield by the current Everton manager.\nOnly Lionel Messi and Sergio Ag\u00fcero have ever scored more for Guardiola than Sterling but City goals had become rarities for the England forward in a 2021 when he has often been out of form and favour. After two in 30 games, though, he has two in as many outings. Guardiola has some way to go to catch Sir Alex Ferguson, who remained in situ while 14 managers on the other side of the Mancunian divide departed, but at least he leapfrogged J\u00fcrgen Klopp to reclaim second place in the Premier League table. The calibre of City\u2019s first two goals \u2013 Bernardo Silva\u2019s third was less memorable \u2013 meant he did so in style. Messi, Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 and Neymar beckon on Wednesday but even they should admire City\u2019s strikes.\n\u201cThe quality of the players we have made the difference,\u201d said Guardiola. \u201cThe last times we play against Rafa Ben\u00edtez at Newcastle, always we struggle a lot.\u201d He encountered a familiar gameplan. \u201cWe were well organised and we defended with intensity,\u201d said Ben\u00edtez. City responded with class. \u201cThe first goal changes everything and the second, even worse,\u201d lamented the Everton manager.\nRodri was the passer turned finisher. In the first half, he completed more passes than all of Everton\u2019s midfielders and forwards did between them. In the second, he showed another side to his game, unleashing an unstoppable shot from 25 yards after meeting Allan\u2019s misdirected ball. There was no false modesty from the scorer. \u201cThe goal was a beauty,\u201d he said.\nSterling had supplied the sublime finish before then with a half-volley that flew past his England teammate Jordan Pickford. It came from Jo\u00e3o Cancelo\u2019s flighted pass, giving him a fifth assist in three matches. They are freakish figures for a left-back, but plenty of playmakers would be unable to supply a ball of that deftness and delicacy. \u201cHe is in incredible top form,\u201d said Guardiola.\nThe same might not have been said of Sterling. An unused substitute in the Manchester derby, he might not have played until injury sidelined Jack Grealish and Covid waylaid Kevin De Bruyne, but he enjoyed his opportunity. \u201cHe has to perform like he performed today,\u201d said Guardiola. \u201cHe did a great job.\u201d\nReturning to his old beat on the right flank, Sterling crossed for Foden, who returned the favour, though neither could direct his header on target. But for a point-blank save from Pickford, Sterling would have scored a late second. He had also been initially awarded a penalty. There was some dispute if Michael Keane\u2019s challenge was in the box; upon seeing the incident again, the referee, Stuart Attwell, decided it was not even a foul. Everton, who were denied a penalty after a VAR intervention against Tottenham a fortnight earlier, could sense that technology was a great leveller.\nCity needed neither a spot-kick nor their sidelined superstars. As Guardiola reshaped his forward line, Cole Palmer was granted a first Premier League start in the manager\u2019s beloved position, as a false nine. He showed an aptitude for it. \u201cA good performance,\u201d said Guardiola. It featured a low shot Pickford clawed away.\nStill more auspicious was the moment when he dropped off and provided a defence-splitting pass for Silva to scurry into the gap he had created. Pickford came off his line to block the shot but the ball looped up to Ilkay G\u00fcndogan. He lifted his header over Pickford, but it flicked the bar. It was a further sign of Palmer\u2019s influence that his deflected effort fell for Silva to add the third.\n\u201cHe is an incredible investment for the future,\u201d Guardiola said. Palmer was replaced by a second 19-year-old, with James McAtee\u2019s top-flight debut coming in a cameo. \u201cWe have exceptional players in the academy,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cWe have a good generation of four, five or six players and I am not shy to use them.\u201d\nIf options abound for him, they are narrowing for a beleaguered Ben\u00edtez as Everton\u2019s injury problems worsened and Richarlison picked up a caution that rules him out of Sunday\u2019s trip to Brentford. They lost their most dynamic winger and a flagship success of Ben\u00edtez\u2019s bargain-basement buying when Demarai Gray limped off. \u201cWe will have to deal with that,\u201d said his manager.",

        "content": "Coronavirus cases rising across the country for the first time in weeks as experts fear Thanksgiving will fuel a further increase\nThe US government\u2019s chief medical adviser Dr Anthony Fauci warned on Sunday that time was running short to prevent a \u201cdangerous\u201d new surge of Covid-19 infections from overwhelming the upcoming holiday season.\nCoronavirus cases across the US are rising again for the first time in weeks, and approaching 100,000 a day. Experts fear that this week\u2019s Thanksgiving holiday, for which tens of millions of Americans will travel for indoor celebrations with family and friends, will fuel a further surge.\nFauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said it was not too late to avoid a significant worsening of Covid-19 rates leading up to Christmas and New Year if the public acted now on new measures to subdue the virus, such as Friday\u2019s approval of booster shots for adults and the recent opening up of vaccinations to children aged five to 11.\n\u201cWe still have about 60 million people in this country who are eligible to be vaccinated who have not been, and that results in the dynamic of virus in the community that not only is dangerous and makes people who are unvaccinated vulnerable, but it also spills over into the vaccinated people,\u201d Fauci said on CNN\u2019s State of the Union on Sunday.\n\u201cWe have a lot of virus circulating around. You can\u2019t walk away from the data, and the data show that the cases are starting to go up, which is not unexpected when you get into a winter season. People start to go indoors more and we know that immunity does wane over time.\n\u201cThe bottom line is get vaccinated if you\u2019re not vaccinated, and boostered if you have been vaccinated. Since we can vaccinate children from five to 11, you start vaccinating them now [and] they will be fully vaccinated by the time we get to the Christmas holidays.\u201d\nThe numbers of Americans traveling for Thanksgiving this year will be close to pre-pandemic levels, the federal Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has predicted, raising fears at a time when the Biden administration has struggled to get its vaccination message across.\nThe daily average of new cases has risen 29% in the last 14 days, analysis by the New York Times shows, while fewer than 60% of those eligible are fully vaccinated. Meanwhile, the 2021 US death toll from Covid has surpassed that of 2020, according to the Wall Street Journal.\nAdditionally, Joe Biden\u2019s efforts to improve those figures through compulsory vaccination have stalled. The requirement for businesses of more than 100 employees remains blocked by the courts while Republican leaders in some states have kneecapped the president by enacting laws specifically outlawing such mandates.\nDisney, one of Florida\u2019s biggest employers, announced on Saturday it would no longer insist cast members be vaccinated, after the governor, Ron DeSantis, signed sweeping legislation on Thursday countermanding Biden\u2019s order. In a move that many saw as infantile, DeSantis chose the unincorporated Florida community of Brandon for the signing \u2013 \u201cLet\u2019s Go Brandon\u201d has become an offensive anti-Biden rallying call of the right in recent weeks.\nIn a later appearance Sunday on ABC\u2019s This Week, Fauci was cautious over suggestions by vaccine manufacturers that annual boosters might be necessary to keep Covid-19 at bay.\n\u201cWe would hope, and this is something that we\u2019re looking at very carefully, that that third shot with the mRNA [vaccine] not only boosts you way up, but increases the durability so that you will not necessarily need it every six months, or a year,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re hoping it pushes it out more. If it doesn\u2019t and the data show we do need it more often then we\u2019ll do it.\u201d",

        "content": "Melita pipeline would fuel Delimara power station, which Daphne Caruana Galizia was investigating when she was killed\nEU energy ministers are pushing to allow public funds to help build a gas pipeline to a power station in Malta co-owned by a businessman who is awaiting trial for the murder of the journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia.\nOn Tuesday, officials and MEPs will begin deciding new rules aimed at phasing out EU subsidies for fossil fuel projects.\nHowever, on Friday EU ambassadors confirmed that Malta and Cyprus had secured exemptions for pipelines that would connect them to European gas networks.\nIn practice, that means the \u20ac400m (\u00a3340m) Melita pipeline project, designed to transport gas from Gela in Sicily to Delimara in Malta, could be built using EU funds.\nCyprus also stands to benefit from an exemption to the phaseout of EU support for fossil fuel infrastructure. The \u20ac7bn EastMed pipeline is an even bigger endeavour than the Malta-Italy link \u2013 it will join Cyprus to the European gas network along with Greece and Israel.\nThe move was criticised by environmental campaigners because it would lock in Malta\u2019s dependence on the Delimara gas-fired power station, which is partly owned by the man accused of having masterminded the killing of Caruana Galizia.\nThe Maltese businessman Yorgen Fenech was previously a director of ElectroGas, the company that operates the Delimara power station, and along with his family owns a key stake in the company. He was charged this year with conspiracy in the murder of Caruana Galizia. Maltese prosecutors have recommended a life sentence, and he is due to stand trial. Fenech denies playing any part in the killing.\nBefore his arrest, he was chief executive of his family business, the Tumas Group, which teamed up with other Maltese families to secure a one-third stake in ElectroGas. He owns shares in the venture through Tumas and through a separate company. His uncle and Tumas chair Raymond Fenech said he was unaware of the EU proposals.\n\u201cYorgen Fenech is a minority shareholder in Tumas Group holding less than 4% of the company\u2019s shares which have devolved through inheritance,\u201d he added.\nCaruana Galizia was investigating the awarding of the Delimara power station contract to ElectroGas when she died in a car bombing in 2017. Maltese police have said they believe she was killed over her reporting on the power station.\nBarnaby Pace, a gas campaigner at the corruption and environmental organisation Global Witness, said: \u201cThis pipeline threatens to lock Malta into using polluting fossil fuels and dealing with this fossil gas project, tied to the murder of Daphne Caruana Galizia, for decades to come. The EU needs to put the interests of Maltese and EU citizens before the profits of big polluters and refuse to be involved with yet another fossil-fuelled deal.\u201d\nElectroGas argues that the gas-fired power station marked an environmental improvement when it opened in 2017 because it replaced a plant that ran on heavy fuel oil, which is even more polluting than gas. Malta is also supplied with electricity from an interconnector linking it to Sicily.\nDelimara is presently powered using liquefied natural gas, which is brought in by ship. Along with the interconnector to Sicily, it meets most of the country\u2019s power needs. Only about 7% of electricity in Malta is generated from renewable sources, one of the lowest rates in the EU.\nAn EU official said that Malta had the support of other EU ambassadors when the exemption was secured on Friday. \u201cSeveral delegations explicitly spoke in favour of maintaining the derogation,\u201d the official said.\nA group of 11 countries, including Ireland, Germany and the Netherlands, had originally pushed for existing fossil fuel projects to be excluded from support. But Cyprus and Malta, supported by most eastern European delegations, were able to point to a 10-year-old European Council conclusion that \u201cno EU member state should remain isolated from the European gas and electricity networks after 2015\u201d.",

The march, which police estimated involved 35,000 people, began peacefully but descended into violence as several hundred people started pelting officers, smashing cars and setting rubbish bins on fire. Police responded with teargas and water cannon.\n\u201cWe have injuries but we cannot yet say how many,\u201d said Ilse Vande Keere, a police spokesperson. It was also unclear how many people had been detained.\nDemonstrators had earlier gathered to protest against the government\u2019s advice to get vaccinated and any possible moves to impose mandatory shots. Shouting \u201cfreedom, freedom, freedom!\u201d and singing the anti-fascist song Bella Ciao, protesters lined up behind a huge banner saying \u201ctogether for freedom\u201d and marched to the EU headquarters. Signs among the crowd varied from far-right insignia to the rainbow flags of the LGBT community.\nIt followed a second night of violence in the Netherlands on Saturday, when five police officers were injured and at least 40 people arrested. Dutch authorities deployed water cannon, dogs and mounted police to dispel crowds of rioting youths who lit fires and lobbed fireworks in The Hague and elsewhere, after more than 50 people were arrested in Rotterdam on Friday.\nThere were also demonstrations in Austria, Italy, Switzerland, Denmark, Croatia and the French overseas territory of Guadeloupe as governments in various EU countries battle a fourth wave of the pandemic, imposing partial lockdowns and tighter restrictions, particularly on the unvaccinated.\nPolice said on Sunday that 19 people had been arrested in The Hague in protests triggered by government plans to restrict a national coronavirus pass required to enter bars, restaurants and other venues to people who are fully vaccinated or have recovered from Covid-19 \u2013 excluding those with a negative test.\nMounted officers carried out charges and five were hurt, one seriously. One protester was detained after throwing a rock through an ambulance window. Eight people were also arrested in the former fishing village of Urk.\nTwo matches in the country\u2019s top professional football league being played behind closed doors under a three-week partial lockdown imposed last Saturday were briefly halted when fans forced their way into stadiums in Alkmaar and Almelo.\nAnother 13 arrests were reported by police in two towns in the southern province of Limburg, and disturbances were also reported in the northern province of Flevoland. The protesters were also angry at a New Year\u2019s Eve firework ban.\nThe latest incidents in the Netherlands \u2013 where coronavirus infections have surged to record levels in recent weeks, putting hospitals under severe strain \u2013 followed what Rotterdam\u2019s mayor, Ahmed Aboutaleb, called \u201can orgy of violence\u201d on Friday night.\nPolice opened fire on a crowd that had swelled to hundreds during the protest and three people believed to have been hit by police bullets were still being treated in hospital on Sunday, according to a statement from authorities.\nThousands of people also marched peacefully through Amsterdam and the southern Dutch city of Breda earlier on Saturday in protest at the restrictions, with little or no trouble reported.\nIn Austria, which on Friday announced a 20-day nationwide partial lockdown \u2013 the toughest in western Europe for months \u2013 and made vaccination mandatory for all from February, as many as 40,000 went out to protest in central Vienna.\nResponding to a call from the far-right Freedom party (FP\u00d6), the protesters carried banners reading \u201ccorona dictatorship\u201d and \u201cdivided society\u201d. Some wore yellow stars reading \u201cnot vaccinated\u201d.\nThe interior minister, Karl Nehammer, expressed his outrage, saying in a statement that the star \u201cinsults the millions of victims of the Nazi dictatorship and their families\u201d.\nThousands of protesters also marched in Croatia\u2019s capital, Zagreb, while in Denmark about a thousand people protested against government plans to reinstate a measure requiring public sector workers to be vaccinated in order to access their workplaces.\nThe French interior minister, G\u00e9rald Darmanin, on Saturday condemned violent demonstrations in the overseas territory of Guadeloupe, where 31 people were detained by police overnight amid riots over a nightly 6pm to 5am curfew.\nThe protesters also denounced France\u2019s health pass, which has been required since the summer to access restaurants, cafes, cinemas and theatres, exercise in gyms, attend sporting events and take planes or long-distance trains.\n\u201cThe first message is that the state will stand firm,\u201d Darmanin told reporters, adding France would send about 50 members of the GIGN and Raid elite tactical forces of the gendarmerie and police to the territory, where stores have been looted and shots fired at police.\nThe extra forces will increase the number of police and gendarmes available in Guadeloupe to 2,250. The French prime minister, Jean Castex, is expected to meet officials from the island on Monday to discuss the deteriorating situation.",

        "content": "When people are born into money it\u2019s like they\u2019ve stepped on an up escalator, borne effortlessly upwards while the poor go down\nIn the last few decades, an apparently ordinary financial institution has assumed an importance that could hardly have been foreseen. It is not a finance company, a payday lender or even a crypto-currency. It is, rather, the Bank of Mum and Dad. Barely a day goes by without a media story about the struggles of young people to afford a first home, and their experience is rarely free from some kind of parental influence. Even the young grafters who have supposedly pulled themselves up by the bootstraps into homeownership often turn out to have lived rent-free with their parents or received some other kind of family support. Even more often, of course, they have simply relied on a large deposit from mum and dad.\nThis is, in one sense, innocuous: parents want to assist their offspring financially, and have surely been doing so for as long as money has existed. But it is also insidious, because it allows some young people a significant \u2013 and completely unfair \u2013 advantage over others. And because those who can help their children into homeownership are themselves more likely to be homeowners, it ensures that advantage and disadvantage are passed down the generations. The economist Shamubeel Eaqub, with his eye for a well-turned phrase, calls this \u201cthe return of the landed gentry\u201d.\nThis is just one sign among many that, contrary to the idea of a classless New Zealand, we live in a country with entrenched social differences. It also calls on us to take a closer look at our history, because for all the traditional talk of fairness, plenty of other forces have been at work.\nDuring the postwar period, the landowner Charles Prendergast Knight, faced with a Labour government that was raising taxes, strengthening the welfare state and attacking inherited wealth, wrote defiantly to his friend Maurice Le Cren, \u201cwell, dear fellow, we still have our breeding!\u201d\nThis scene, which could have come straight out of snobbish Britain, sits oddly with the New Zealand myth that has always proclaimed this an egalitarian country. At certain times, for certain groups, and looked at under certain lights, it has been that country. But it also has been, and is, deeply unequal. The word \u201cbreeding\u201d brings this home to us: a signifier of superior bloodlines or upbringing, it bespeaks hierarchy. And while Knight\u2019s belief in it may have been extreme, it was not unique.\nAlthough New Zealand is at last coming to grips with the legacy of colonisation, it has been slower to recognise a deep seam of intense economic and social differences \u2013 including among P\u0101keh\u0101 (European New Zealanders) \u2013 that runs right through its history. In the 1890s, for instance, the wealthiest 1 per cent owned fully two-thirds of the country\u2019s assets. Things are more equal today, but even so, roughly that share of assets is still commanded by the wealthiest tenth. The pursuit of economic wealth is, by itself, unsurprising. People crave the security it provides: the stability, the reserves to draw down, the stake in the future. But it becomes destructive when the imbalance of wealth goes far beyond what is fair or healthy. At present, someone in the wealthiest 1 per cent of adults \u2013 a 40,000-strong club \u2013 has a net worth sixty-eight times that of the typical (median) New Zealander. Can we really say that someone, no matter how talented or hard-working, is worth nearly seventy times the typical Kiwi?\nDwelling on upper-end privilege can often be discomforting to New Zealanders. Raised on a diet of egalitarian ideas, many feel uncomfortable talking about wealth; such discussion is often dismissed as the politics of envy. Poverty, though still controversial, is a safer subject. But we cannot understand deprivation unless we understand affluence. On the wealth spectrum, everyone is connected; everyone\u2019s actions affect everyone else. The more profits go to company owners, the less there is left for frontline workers. An excess at one end makes a deficit at the other. While we can seek to raise living standards for all \u2013 subject to environmental limits \u2013 we can never generate so much wealth that we can forget about its distribution.\nThink, too, about what accumulates around wealth. An unequal wealth distribution creates, and is created by, inequalities in many of the other \u201cgoods\u201d that make for fulfilling lives: health, housing, schooling, income and political power, to name a few. Wealth opens up opportunities to live in certain areas, get one\u2019s children into certain kinds of school, make certain kinds of social connection, exert certain kinds of power. Those things in turn make it easier to accumulate wealth. And wealth itself generates wealth, through interest, rents and dividends. It is as if people have stepped on an up escalator and, whatever their initial merits, been borne upwards by a mechanism that relies little on their own effort. In contrast, those with minimal wealth are kept on a down escalator by factors \u2013 forced reliance on loan sharks, lack of decent jobs or the skills to fill them, damp and mouldy housing, discrimination \u2013 that are also largely beyond their control.\nThese disadvantages and advantages get passed along the generations. The most prestigious university courses recruit disproportionately from the wealthiest schools, entrance to which in turn relies on the purchase of the most expensive \u201cin-zone\u201d properties. University entrants more generally tend to be those with university-educated parents. People with serious wealth, in short, can concentrate opportunities and goods around themselves, and pass them on to their children. They can do this using mechanisms not available to other families \u2013 mechanisms that, in fact, exclude the children of other families.\nNew Zealand is not yet the US, with its extraordinary wealth inequalities and pipeline of opportunity running from high-stakes kindergarten entry through exclusive prep schools to elite, inordinately expensive Ivy League universities. But there are signs \u2013 especially in the growing segregation of secondary schools \u2013 that we have for some time been heading in that direction. Since the 1980s, economic inequality in New Zealand has risen dramatically, exacerbating other disparities and concentrating opportunities at the top. Our wealthy families may have become, as the Americans have it, \u201copportunity hoarders\u201d.\nMax Rashbrooke is a senior associate at New Zealand\u2019s Institute for Governance and Policy Studies.

The episode was dismissed by the Conservative MP Tim Loughton, of the influential Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China as \u201cstraight out of the Chinese Communist party playbook\u201d, with the group adding: \u201cThe video cannot be considered proof that she is either well or safe.\u201d\nLoughton said: \u201cThe IOC call does nothing to prove Peng Shuai is safe and well, as anybody who has been paying attention to the CCP\u2019s tactics would know. Xi\u2019s regime disappears people all the time. But incredibly, the IOC is bending over backwards to legitimise these hostage tactics. The IOC should take a leaf out of the WTA\u2019s book, [which] has stood up fearlessly, and should be applauded.\n\u201cIf people as high profile as Peng Shuai can be disappeared, then goodness knows how many others have fallen foul of the Chinese paranoia. Against this background, lending our stamp of approval to the Beijing Olympics is simply unthinkable.\u201d\nOliver Dowden, the chair of the Conservative party, described the situation as very worrying, adding he welcomed the pressure from the Foreign Office, which over the weekend urged Beijing to offer \u201cverifiable evidence\u201d of Peng\u2019s whereabouts and safety.\nThe Labour frontbench has tabled written questions asking what representations the Foreign Office has made to the Chinese authorities.\nMinisters in the Lords on Thursday will be asked to comment formally by Lord Alton on reports that Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, regards the attack on Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang as genocide.\nAlton is one of the five signatories in a letter calling for a ban on any official UK diplomatic representation at the Winter Olympics, which starts in less than three months.\nThe letter was signed by Tom Tugendhat, the Tory chair of the Commons foreign affairs committee, Sir Iain Duncan Smith, a former Conservative party leader, and former ministers Tim Loughton and Nusrat Ghani.\nLabour in June called for a boycott if by 14 September \u2013 the date of the UN general assembly \u2013 the Chinese government had not provided the UN proper access to mount an investigation into the treatment of the Uyghur people. Labour MPs said: \u201cThe UK government should not send ministers, royal family members or senior representatives to participate in any official duties or ceremonies at the Beijing Olympics.\u201d\n\u201cA political boycott by the UK and other states would send a strong signal of the deep global concern with the plight of the Uyghurs and prevent the Games being a PR exercise for the Chinese authorities,\u201d they added.\nThe British government has taken a firm line opposing all-out sport boycotts, but, after reports that the US will mount a diplomatic boycott, the pressure on the UK to follow suit is growing. Overseas spectators have already been banned by China. Truss has taken a tough line on China but is meeting resistance from No 10 and the Cabinet Office.\nSpeaking over the weekend, the national security adviser, Sir Stephen Lovegrove, said: \u201cChina\u2019s rise is the central geopolitical fact of the 21st century and we have absolutely no desire whatsoever to see that checked at all. Its economic growth is important for us all and important for everybody who lives in China.\n\u201cBut, equally, I think what we would like to do is to see accommodation and balance asserted within the established rules that act in everybody\u2019s benefit, not just in the benefit of the established hegemons.\u201d\nOn the issue of the Uyghurs, the UK has repeatedly said that only the international courts can make a determination of genocide. The UK parliament has by contrast voted to describe the repression in Xinjiang as genocide.",

She hosted a reception for business leaders at Windsor on 19 October before the Cop26 climate conference in Glasgow.\nThe Queen\u2019s absence sparked fears her health was declining less than a year after the death of her husband, Prince Philip, at 99.\n\u201cShe\u2019s all right, thank you very much,\u201d Prince Charles said on Wednesday, in response to a question about his mother\u2019s health from Sky News. \u201cOnce you get to 95, it\u2019s not quite as easy as it used to be. It\u2019s bad enough at 73.\u201d\nDuring Sunday\u2019s ceremony Eugenie\u2019s son, August, and Tindall\u2019s son, Lucas Philip, were christened, with other royals including Prince Andrew and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge also in attendance.\nMeanwhile, the Queen was reported by the Mail on Sunday to be upset with a new BBC documentary, presented by media editor Amol Rajan, over expectations it would report William and his brother, Prince Harry, had briefed the media against one other.\nThe newspaper cited an unnamed royal source who attacked The Princes and the Press as \u201ctittle-tattle\u201d, expressing anger over the BBC\u2019s refusal to allow the palace an advance viewing.\nThe source added that Buckingham Palace would refuse to cooperate on future projects unless it is given a right to respond.\nStories of \u201cbriefing wars\u201d and wider internal discord within the royal family will probably whip up further culture war antagonism over the monarchy less than two years after the high-profile departure of Harry and his wife, Meghan, who told Oprah Winfrey she experienced suicidal thoughts as a working royal.",

And I\u2019m glad he is,\u201d the Democratic former Connecticut senator Chris Dodd told the Washington Post in an article published Saturday \u2013 Biden\u2019s 79th birthday.\nAccording to the newspaper, Biden shared his decision \u201cwith a small group of donors\u201d during a virtual fundraiser earlier this month.\nEd Rendell, the former Pennsylvania governor who attended the event, said there was \u201cno difference\u201d in what Biden told the donors to what he stated at a White House press conference in March. Then, Biden attempted to dampen speculation by stating that he had \u201cnever been able to plan three and a half, four years ahead.\u201d\nRendell told the Post: \u201cWhat he is saying publicly is what he firmly believes. He will not run if he feels he can\u2019t do the job physically or emotionally.\u201d\nBiden was already the oldest presidential candidate to be elected as commander in chief when he beat Donald Trump in the November 2020 election, and will be 15 days short of his 82nd birthday on 5 November 2024, the next time voters in the US will be asked to choose their president.\nIn 2019, at a campaign event in New Hampshire, Biden said it was \u201ctotally appropriate\u201d for voters to consider his age.\n\u201cJust like when I was 29 [when he was elected a US senator], was I old enough? And now, am I fit enough? I\u2019ll completely disclose everything about my health. I\u2019m in good shape,\u201d Biden told the rally, according to the Laconia Daily Sun.\nOn Friday, doctors declared Biden \u201cfit to successfully execute the duties of the president\u201d after his first physical in office.\nTrump, who has yet to declare if he will be running again, has frequently taunted Biden over his age and perceived health challenges. The former president, whose weight places him in the obese category, would be 78 on election day 2024.",
