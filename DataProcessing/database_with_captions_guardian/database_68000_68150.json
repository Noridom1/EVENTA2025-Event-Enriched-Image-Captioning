        "content": "\u2018Right now, we are falling short,\u2019 US president says, urging other world leaders to embark upon a shift to clean energy\nJoe Biden has warned that the climate crisis poses \u201cthe existential threat to human existence as we know it\u201d and urged other world leaders to embark upon a transformational shift to clean energy, as questions linger over the US president\u2019s ability to deliver this vision at home.\nBiden, addressing a sparse chamber at crucial UN climate talks that have begun in a frigid and drizzly Glasgow, said that the conference must act as a \u201ckickoff of a decade of ambition and innovation to preserve our shared future\u201d.\nThe president added: \u201cWe meet with the eyes of history upon us. Will we do what is necessary? Or will we condemn future generations to suffer?\u201d\nBiden\u2019s administration is attempting to reassert America\u2019s credibility at the gathering of nearly 200 countries in Scotland, known as Cop26, after Donald Trump\u2019s decision to pull the US from the Paris climate agreement and his dismissal of climate science. Scientists have warned the world is badly off track to avoid disastrous climate change, with leaders of poorer, vulnerable countries using the talks to warn their populations face looming cataclysm.\n\u201cWe will demonstrate to the world the United States is not only back at the table but hopefully leading by the power of our example,\u201d Biden said in his speech, in a tacit acknowledgement of Trump. \u201cI know it hasn\u2019t been the case, which is why my administration is working overtime to show our climate commitment is action not words.\u201d\n\u201cRight now, we are falling short, there\u2019s no time to hang back, sit on the fence or argue amongst ourselves,\u201d the president continued. \u201cThis is the challenge of our collective lifetimes, an existential threat to human existence as we know it and every day we delay the cost of inaction increases.\u201d\nBiden said that wealthy, major polluters such as the US have an \u201coverwhelming responsibility\u201d to aid smaller countries that are struggling to cope with growing floods, fires and heatwaves spurred by global heating.\nBefore arriving in Glasgow, Biden also took aim at some other leading emitters for not doing enough to prevent global heating surpassing 1.5C. He said these countries are \u201cnot only Russia but China (which) basically didn\u2019t show up in terms of commitments to deal with climate change. I found it disappointing myself\u201d.\nAt a side event, Biden also effectively apologized for his predecessor. \u201cI guess I shouldn\u2019t apologize, but I do apologize for the fact that the United States \u2013 the last administration \u2013 pulled out of the Paris accords and put us sort of behind the eight ball,\u201d Biden said.\nBut climate activists, many of whom gathered outside the Glasgow venue that hosted more than 120 world leaders on Monday, argue that Biden is failing to live up to his own words. The president touted vast proposed climate legislation that would be the \u201cmost significant investment to deal with the climate crisis that any advanced nation has made, ever,\u201d but the bill remains stalled in Congress, after being winnowed away by a senator who has extensive ties to fossil fuels.\n\u201cBiden is at Glasgow empty handed, with nothing but words on paper,\u201d said Varshini Prakash, executive director of Sunrise Movement. \u201cIt is humiliating and fails to meet the moment that we\u2019re in.\u201d\nBiden has also been attacked over his administration\u2019s reluctance to drastically scale back oil and gas drilling in the US. The president\u2019s narrative of \u201cclimate leadership\u201d contradicts the daily suffering by communities on the frontline of gas and oil production in the US, activists say. In the first six months of the Biden administration, about 2,500 new oil and gas permits were authorized \u2013 a figure Trump\u2019s administration took a year to reach.\nSpeakers outside Cop26 on Monday \u2013 only 23 civil society observers were allowed in to hear the leaders\u2019 speeches \u2013 included Black and Indigenous leaders whose communities are on the frontline of fossil fuel extraction impacts, including air pollution and contaminated drinking water and land across the US.\nTom Goldtooth, Native American leader from the Indigenous Environmental Network, said: \u201cWe\u2019re here as the original people of the US to denounce the polluters conference \u2013 it\u2019s not a climate conference \u2013 it\u2019s been taken over by corporate interests. If we Indigenous people don\u2019t come we\u2019ll be on the menu. We\u2019re here to defend our people, we want to live.\u201d\nBiden\u2019s speech came shortly after an official opening of Cop26 that acknowledged the growing anguish over the escalating, and largely unchecked, climate crisis. Boris Johnson, the British prime minister, said \u201cthe people who will judge us are children not yet born\u201d, adding \u201cif we fail they will not forgive us\u201d. Antonio Guterres, the secretary general of the UN, warned that \u201cwe are digging our own graves\u201d due to the failure to dramatically cut planet-heating emissions.",

The token\u2019s website and social accounts have disappeared, along with a white paper describing Squid.\nThe token was made available for purchase on 20 October with the idea that the cryptocurrency would be a pay-to-play token to play an online game, inspired by Squid Game, the hit series in which heavily indebted people play deadly versions of children\u2019s games to win cash.\nThe game was set to launch in November and its promoters said winners would be rewarded with more Squid tokens. But even as the cryptocurrency\u2019s price spiked in value last week, many noted that the token could be fraudulent.\nInvestors were having trouble selling their tokens and the cryptocurrency\u2019s white paper was laden with grammatical errors, according to multiple reports.\nThe creators of the cryptocurrency could have made off with as much as $2.1m after the token\u2019s crash, according to Gizmodo.\nCoinMarketCap, a cryptocurrency price-tracking website, warned potential buyers before the crash of the cryptocurrency\u2019s possibly fraudulent nature, telling investors to \u201cplease do your own due diligence and exercise caution while trading\u201d and warning them that investors were having trouble selling their tokens.\nAn anonymous Squid investor told CoinMarketCap, \u201cI lost all of what I had in this project\u201d after investing $5,000 into the cryptocurrency.\nExperts have warned investors to be careful when considering purchasing \u201cmeme\u201d cryptocurrencies based on cultural phenomena, even if it appears the currency is doing well on the market.\n\u201cRemarkably, many such coins rapidly catch investors\u2019 fancy, leading to wildly inflated valuations,\u201d Cornell University economist Eswar Prasad told the BBC. \u201cNa\u00efve retail investors who get caught up in such speculative frenzies face the risk of substantial losses.\u201d",

The 75-year-old chair and chief executive, Stephen Marks, who co-founded the chain in 1972 and owns nearly 42% of the company, is to receive about \u00a312m for his stake in the business.\nApinder Singh Ghura, who in February bought a 25% stake in French Connection from Mike Ashley\u2019s Frasers Group, the owner of Sports Direct, teamed up to buy out the brand with a Manchester-based business partner, Amarjit Singh Grewal, and KJR Brothers, which is led by Rafiq Patel, a textile businessman.\nGhura spent years in the clothing industry before shifting to other investments including property and care homes.\nThe French Connection deal comes after the three acquired the Bench fashion brand in March via a group called Wraith Holdings International, one of whose directors is the former Sports Direct executive Peter Wood.\nWood also co-owns a group called Apparel Brands with Grewal, which holds distribution rights for revival brands including Bench as well as the 1980s casuals label Farah, and Dunlop, the tennis shoe brand that was once owned by Sports Direct.\nThe takeover deal requires final court approval before shares are expected to cease trading on 5 November.\nGhura said: \u201cWe are delighted with the strong support for the recommended acquisition shown in this morning\u2019s shareholder vote. We look forward to working with French Connection\u2019s management to execute and implement our strategic plans to facilitate the future growth and profitability for the business.\n\u201cWe must also pay tribute to French Connection founder, Stephen Marks, for his support during the acquisition process.\u201d\nThe consortium face a battle to revive French Connection after years of problems for the brand, which was once highly sought after because of its controversial FCUK branding that launched in the 1990s and ran until the mid-00s.\nThe group has not made a pre-tax profit since 2012 and has suffered from high street pandemic lockdowns.\nLast month the Financial Reporting Council, an accountancy watchdog, said it was investigating the audit of French Connection\u2019s accounts for the year to January 2020 by the accountancy firm Mazars.\nFrench Connection owns the Great Plains and You Must Create (YMC) brands, and operates 67 stores and concessions in the UK. The group, which has 780 staff, operates in 161 locations overseas under franchises and licences.",

But instead of getting the train, which takes about four and a half hours, he has decided to take a short internal flight from Glasgow to London.\nEarlier, he told a roundtable of leaders of developing nations: \u201cWhen it comes to tackling climate change, words without action, without deeds are absolutely pointless.\u201d\nThe prime minister is one of hundreds of world leaders and businesspeople who have chartered planes to attend the conference aimed at limiting global temperature rises to less than 1.5C. Jeff Bezos, the boss of Amazon, was one of those who flew in to Scotland for the conference.\nJohnson\u2019s spokesperson defended the move, saying the plane ran partly on \u201csustainable aviation fuel\u201d and emitted about half the emissions of other aircraft. The plane will still cause far more emissions than a trip by train.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important the PM is able to move around the country. We have obviously faced significant time constraints,\u201d Johnson\u2019s official spokesperson said.\nThe plane \u2013 an Airbus A321 \u2013 appears to have been leased from a company called Titan Airways, while the prime minister\u2019s usual Voyager is being serviced. His spokesperson said: \u201cThe plane is one of the most carbon-efficient planes of its size in the world. It produces 50% less CO2 emissions than, for example, the larger Voyager plane.\u201d\nPrince Charles also flew from Rome to Glasgow on a private plane separately from the prime minister. It also used sustainable aviation fuel \u2013 a mixture of conventional fuel and biofuel.",

        "content": "So that answers that one, then. In a tournament where everything had gone England\u2019s way, this time it all went against them: asked to bat first after losing the toss, labouring to work out how to pace their innings, bowling as dew drenched the outfield on a heavy, humid night, watching Tymal Mills limp off midway through his second over to shred their death bowling plans as Sri Lanka accelerated towards their target.\nBut they refused to throw in the towel \u2013 after all, they needed it to soak dew off the ball \u2013 and thanks to the genius of Jos Buttler an often unpleasant evening became one to savour. Sri Lanka were beaten by 26 runs and with a 100% record after four games a place in the semi-finals is all but secured.\nButtler led the team off, his colleagues walking 10 paces behind and applauding him all the way. Forty-eight hours after his 32-ball 71 powered England to victory over Australia in Dubai, their diamond demonstrated several other facets of his brilliance with a 67-ball century, transforming an innings that for a while, as so many have in this tournament, got lost in the doldrums.\nBut with the wind in his sails there are few batters to match Buttler and he accelerated to his first international Twenty20 century \u2013 becoming the second English player, after Heather Knight, to hit hundreds in all three formats \u2013 by lifting the final ball of the innings over square-leg for six. Over the course of 20 overs he was England\u2019s opener, their anchor and their finisher.\nHow they needed him. The thing about auras of invincibility is that, handsome as they are when they settle upon you, they are not very hardwearing. Just a couple of scratches and off it comes.\nIt had taken three wonderfully dominant victories for England to construct the one they sported coming into this fixture, but within 20 minutes it was looking distinctly ragged.\nWhat has set this England team apart as they have clambered from white-ball ignominy to supremacy over the past six years is an unwavering consistency of intent. They go hard and, no matter the circumstances, they keep going hard. No let-up, no respite. Here, though, for an extended period they went worryingly limp. On an unfamiliar ground, on a wicket that was skating-rink flat and sometimes similarly skiddy, they could not find their footing for a long time.\nIt did not help their cause that Sri Lanka, who had played three times in Sharjah at this World Cup, have a gem of their own in Wanindu Hasaranga, who claimed the wickets of Jason Roy, Jonny Bairstow and Eoin Morgan in four excellent overs. He has taken 34 wickets in 2021, the most by any bowler in any single year in this format.\nBut once Buttler started his acceleration Sri Lanka had no answer. His first 50 took 45 balls and his second 22, as he made the short boundaries look positively microscopic. Morgan took 19 balls to reach eight and then another 17 to reach 40 and between them they dragged England to a total of 163 for four.\nSri Lanka, so soundly beaten in England in June and July, are a rapidly improving side, and this was a compelling contest until the final minutes.\nOnce again England took three wickets in the powerplay, but Sri Lanka remained on some kind of track to reach their target until a dramatic late implosion. Mills\u2019s injury helped, the fast bowler pulling up halfway through the 14th over to force Morgan into an on-the-hoof rethink of England\u2019s tactical plans. He settled on a devilishly cunning one: robbed of the man who often bowls the 20th over, England ended the match in 19.\nHasaranga was primarily responsible for keeping Sri Lanka\u2019s hopes alive that long, the 24-year-old scoring 34 off 21 and putting on 53 for the sixth wicket with his captain, Dasun Shanaka. But once he went the innings crumbled in a few chaotic minutes of wild hitting and superlative fielding.\nIt started with Hasaranga scooping Liam Livingstone to long-off, where Jason Roy sprinted to his left and aware that he was heading inexorably towards the rope tossed the ball to the substitute fielder, Sam Billings, to complete the catch.\nFour balls later Shanaka was run out by Buttler, running around from behind the stumps, flinging off his gloves as he went, before hitting the stumps from 15 yards. Three catches in the deep later 129 for five had become 137 all out. Sri Lanka had shown that England are fallible, but they could not make them fall.",

We take a look at some of the controversies that have plagued the bank since the 2008 financial crisis.\nThe Serious Fraud Office launches an investigation in 2012, and eventually accuses Barclays bankers of funnelling secret fees to Qatari investors in exchange for emergency funding at the height of the financial crisis in 2008.\nIt resulted in the only criminal trial brought against UK banking executives during the financial crisis, and involved four senior bankers, including the chief executive, John Varley. Varley was acquitted by an appeals court in June 2019, while the three remaining executives were found not guilty in a criminal trial in February 2020.\nBarclays is fined for manipulating the benchmark Libor interest rate in 2012, after revelations stretching back to 2005.\nThe scandal, which engulfed a number of its global banking peers, results in the resignation of its chief executive, Bob Diamond, after just 18 months in the post.\nAn independent review of Barclays\u2019 business practices urges the bank to strengthen its board, cooperate more closely with City watchdogs, and link pay more closely to the bank\u2019s performance after discovering a \u201cwinning at all costs\u201d culture at the lender.\nThe chief executive, Jes Staley, is fined almost \u00a3650,000 and ordered to repay \u00a3500,000 of his bonus for twice attempting to unmask a whistleblower in 2016. Staley used the bank\u2019s internal security unit to try to discover who had written letters to the board regarding a new hire at Barclays, who was also a former friend and colleague of Staley\u2019s at JP Morgan. Staley later apologised to the bank\u2019s board.\nStaley caused a rift between the bank and its private equity client KKR after backing his brother-in-law in a complicated legal dispute with the buyout house. While Staley argued that he was involved in a personal capacity, rather than as chief executive of Barclays, it strained the bank\u2019s relationship with one of its longtime clients.\nBusinesswoman Amanda Staveley takes Barclays to court after learning that it had offered her Abu Dhabi client a worse deal than that it offered to Qatari investors when it was seeking emergency funding in 2008.\nStaveley lost the court battle in February 2021, despite the judge finding that the bank was \u201cguilty of serious deceit\u201d in the way it raised money to avoid a UK government bailout at the height of the financial crisis.\nBarclays announces that City regulators have opened an investigation into Staley over his characterisation of his relationship with the sex offender and disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein to Barclays, and \u201cthe subsequent description of that relationship in the company\u2019s response to the FCA [Financial Conduct Authority]\u201d.\nStaley resigns in November 2021 after being made aware of the preliminary findings of the inquiry, but plans to contest its conclusions.",

But Youngkin was not planning to participate, as he attempted to balance appeals to the former president\u2019s supporters with a semblance of independence.\nTrump hoped a phone-in \u201ctele rally\u201d would hoist Youngkin past his Democratic opponent, the former governor Terry McAuliffe.\nThe contest is seen by many as a referendum on the Biden presidency and a bellwether for midterm elections next year. On the day before polling day, the realclearpolitics.com polling average had Youngkin ahead by less than two points. Fivethirtyeight.com put the Republican up by one.\nMcAuliffe had scheduled rallies in Roanoke, Virginia Beach and Richmond and in northern Virginia. Youngkin was to rally in Roanoke, Richmond, Virginia Beach and Loudon county.\nIn Richmond, Youngkin addressed \u201can energetic crowd of what his campaign said was around 800 people\u201d at a small airport, the Associated Press reported.\n\u201cThis is a moment for Virginians to push back on this left, liberal progressive agenda and take our commonwealth back,\u201d he said.\nMcAuliffe, who has called himself a \u201cpro-business pro-progressive\u201d, is a close ally of Bill and Hillary Clinton and has campaigned with President Joe Biden, Vice-President Kamala Harris, former president Barack Obama and other high-profile Democrats. Nonetheless he has struggled to generate enthusiasm in a state Biden won by 10 points.\nYoungkin, a businessman, has not appeared with Trump. On Saturday, he told reporters: \u201cI\u2019m not going to be engaged in the tele-town hall. The teams are talking, I\u2019m sure.\u201d\nYoungkin has however comfortably dealt in Trump-esque attack lines, most prominently and potentially fruitfully focusing on how race is taught in schools. In return McAuliffe has sought to tie Youngkin firmly to Trump, not a tough task in the debate over education.\nYoungkin has repeatedly raised the subject of critical race theory, an academic discipline turned into a bogeyman by Republicans nationwide. CRT examines the ways in which racism operates in US laws and society. It is not taught in Virginia public schools. Regardless, Youngkin has treated it as a genuine threat, stoking anger on the right, and has promised to ban it.\nSpeaking to NBC\u2019s Meet the Press on Sunday, McAuliffe said Youngkin had gone too far. Citing a meeting with a voter in Hampton, he said the former school board member told him \u201cour school boards were fine. Soon as Glenn Youngkin got nominated, all of a sudden, these people started showing up, creating such a ruckus, calling such obscene things\u201d.\n\u201cThis was an African American woman,\u201d McAuliffe said. \u201cI can\u2019t repeat on air what they\u2019ve said about her. This was last night, up here in northern Virginia \u2026 we just lost a school board member \u2026 She said, \u2018I was getting death threats. But when they said they were going to rape my children, I can\u2019t take it anymore.\u2019\n\u201cThat\u2019s what Glenn Youngkin has done here in Virginia. He\u2019s created hatred and division just like Donald Trump, and that\u2019s why Donald Trump, his final campaign is going to be for Glenn Youngkin here in Virginia.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want Trump. We don\u2019t want Youngkin. We don\u2019t want the hatred and division.\u201d\nIn a statement on Monday, Trump freely demonstrated his willingness to exploit hatred and division.\nTaking barely veiled shots at the Lincoln Project \u2013 anti-Trump Republicans who have campaigned against him in Virginia, sometimes controversially, and who Trump referred to only as \u201cperverts\u201d \u2013 the former president said his enemies were \u201ctrying to create an impression that Glenn Youngkin and I are at odds and don\u2019t like each other.\n\u201cImportantly, this is not true. We get along very well together and strongly believe in many of the same policies, especially when it comes to the important subject of education.\u201d\nTrump reiterated the need for Republicans to vote. He also sought to thread the needle between his insistence on mass voter fraud against him and the need for high Republican turnout \u2013 a trick he failed to pull off in Georgia in January, when Democrats won two Senate runoffs.\nIf enough of his supporters voted, Trump said, they would overcome the fact that he was \u201cnot a believer in the integrity of Virginia\u2019s elections\u201d.",

Derby-based Rolls-Royce has several sites and suppliers based in the north of England.\nThe Qatar Foundation, the state\u2019s non-profit organisation created in 1995 to focus on education and research, will provide the funding to develop the campuses and support their operations for two decades.\nMeanwhile, Rolls-Royce will bring the knowhow in engineering and high-end manufacturing, and will use the centre to develop emerging climate technologies.\nStartup businesses will be provided with academic help and funding for research and development on campus, combined with early-stage venture capital investment, so they can test, prove and later scale-up their technologies.\nRolls-Royce has an ongoing relationship with the state-owned Qatar Airways, which is one of the company\u2019s biggest customers for its Trent jet engines.\nWarren East, the chief executive of Rolls-Royce, called the transition to net zero \u201ca societal imperative and an excellent commercial opportunity\u201d.\nHe added that the company wanted to accelerate the energy transition in sectors that were the hardest to decarbonise. The firm, which is also pushing ahead with plans to create a fleet of mini nuclear reactors, has pledged to reach net zero emissions from its operations by 2030.\n\u201cThis partnership with Qatar Foundation will enable us to accelerate progress in clean energy, including by allowing us to fully take advantage of nascent technologies that could have a significant impact on tackling climate change,\u201d East said.\nThe venture was announced on the sidelines of the Cop26 climate crisis conference, being held in Glasgow, as the British prime minister, Boris Johnson, met the emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani.\nQatar is the smallest \u2013 and richest per capita \u2013 of the Gulf states, as well as the world\u2019s biggest exporter of liquefied natural gas. However, its partnership with Rolls-Royce will enable it to take its place in the top five countries globally that are investing in research and development in clean energy.\nPart of Qatar\u2019s 2030 national strategy involves gradual economic diversification away from a dependence on fossil fuels such as oil and gas.",

        "content": "Even veteran bankers touting for deals should be careful about the company they keep\nBank chief executives can survive an official censure, as Jes Staley proved in 2018 \u2013 when he kept his job despite being fined \u00a3642,000 for trying to unmask a whistleblower at Barclays. A second adverse finding tends to be terminal, however. This time Staley required complete vindication from regulators examining his, and the board\u2019s, description of his relationship with Jeffery Epstein. His resignation signals that he did not get what he needed: he had to go.\nWhat, precisely, do regulators judge that he got wrong this time? Impossible to say until the Financial Conduct Authority and Prudential Regulation Authority publish their report, which could be at least a month away; the only point of clarity currently is that there are \u201cno findings that Mr Staley saw, or was aware of, any of Mr Epstein\u2019s alleged crimes\u201d, says Barclays.\nFine, but the aim of the inquiry was to determine whether \u201ca close professional relationship\u201d, which was the gist of Staley\u2019s account of his dealings with the sex offender financier, was strictly accurate. Regulators are seemingly unhappy with his characterisation.\nStaley will contest the findings, as he\u2019s entitled to do. Viewed from outside, however, the most extraordinary aspect of the tale is not the narrow regulatory focus on who said what, and whether the presentation was crystal clear. One keeps coming back to the question of why Staley maintained any form of relationship with Epstein after the financier had been sentenced for soliciting prostitution from a minor in 2008.\nThere was a Florida visit the following year and then, most remarkably, Staley and his wife popped in by yacht to see Epstein on his Caribbean island in April 2015. Staley was not alone in maintaining links with the convicted paedophile, of course, but even veteran Wall Street bankers touting for deals should be careful about the company they keep. Staley\u2019s judgment was terrible.\nRegulatory run-ins aside, his performance as chief executive of Barclays has been better than the pedestrian share price would suggest. The biggest call was doubling up on investment banking, which was a risky bet on arrival in December 2015 but Barclays\u2019 financial returns have gone back to respectable levels. Staley\u2019s vision of a \u201ctransatlantic\u201d bank that combines UK mortgages and Wall Street trading has prevailed. Edward Bramson, the activist who agitated for a retreat from investment banking, was defeated by numbers.\nIn its clinical way, the stock market marked the end of the Staley era with a fall of only 1% in Barclays share price. The boss was seen as likely to leave soon anyway, and the new chief executive is CS Venkatakrishnan, a Staley recruit from JP Morgan who will not upset the broad strategy.\nBut even publication of the regulators\u2019 report, assuming Staley does not manage to overturn the findings of a 20-month inquiry, will not quite be the end of the story. There are also questions here for Nigel Higgins, the Barclays chair, and the rest of the board.\nThe directors backed Staley all the way, and there was an air of defiance on Monday as they said they were \u201cdisappointed at this outcome\u201d and heaped praise on their man. Is that a wise stance? Staley could easily have been fired after the whistleblower affair. It\u2019s hard to see any upside for the bank in extending a quarrel with its two main regulators.\nMichael O\u2019Leary loves a throwaway line, but his plan to delist Ryanair from the London Stock Exchange sounds advanced. He blames Brexit, by which he means EU rules that require EU airlines to be majority owned by nationals from within the bloc plus a few other European countries that do not include the UK.\nOne can call it another blow to the standing of the London market, but it is primarily a political failure on the part of the UK and EU to agree a deal on airline ownership. If it\u2019s OK for Swiss investors to own a slice of Irish-based Ryanair, there is no logic in denying UK investors. This is a Brexit loose-end that should have been settled in about five minutes of negotiation.",

L\u00f3pez had covered Central American politics and the Zapatista uprising for news organisations such as Reuters, the Los Angeles Times and Notimex, and he still reported on the local political situation.\nOn the same day, Acapulco journalist Alfredo Cardoso was pulled from his home by masked gunmen who also threatened his family. He was found the next day having been shot five times, and died from his injuries in hospital on Sunday, according to press freedom organization Reporters Without Borders.\nCardoso previously worked as a photojournalist in Acapulco, a city which was once the jewel in the crown of Mexican tourist destinations but has been a hotbed of drug cartel violence for more than a decade. More recently he was the manager of the online news site Revista Dos Costas.\n\u201cThe situation for journalists in Acapulco and all of Guerrero [state] has worsened,\u201d said Bernandino Hern\u00e1ndez, a photojournalist in the coastal city.\n\u201cJournalists have been threatened, some have had to flee. It\u2019s a really dicey situation,\u201d he said.\nNo suspects have been arrested for either crime. Crimes committed against Mexican journalists almost always wallow in impunity \u2013 the product of inept and inadequate investigations, a lack of political will to stop the killings of media workers and frequent collusion between drug cartels.\nThe two attacks reinforced Mexico\u2019s reputation as the most murderous country for journalists in the hemisphere.\nThe country\u2019s murder rate has steadily risen since the then president Felipe Calder\u00f3n declared a militarized crackdown on drug cartels in 2006.\nIn the same period, attacks on journalists have also skyrocketed. Analysts say those most at risk are reporters who cover the intersection between local politics and the drugs trade.\n\u201cThese murders take place within a context of continuously deteriorating security in the country, for all citizens, but particularly for human rights defenders and journalists,\u201d said Jan-Albert Hootsen, Mexico representative for the Committee to Protect Journalists.\n\u201cThese attacks are fueled by impunity, which is almost complete in crimes against the press.

        "content": "A fiery war of words has erupted between the French president and Australian prime minister over submarines. So how did it come to this?\nThe French president, Emmanuel Macron, has accused Scott Morrison of lying over the submarines deal, prompting the Australian prime minister to launch a furious rebuttal of what he called \u201cslurs\u201d and \u201csledging\u201d.\nLet\u2019s take a look beneath the soundbites to try to find out what on earth has happened.\nFirst, the basics. The French contract with Australia to provide 12 conventionally powered submarines has been a big deal for France \u2013 financially and strategically \u2013 since it was initiated in 2016. The total value of the submarine project was estimated at almost $A90bn (although that figure includes all spending associated with it).\nSo it is only natural that a French president would be upset when Australia revealed it had decided to scrap the contract and would instead partner with the US and the UK to acquire at least eight nuclear-powered submarines (pending an 18-month study).\nYes. The French government has taken exception to the manner in which the Aukus partnership was negotiated in secret, claiming it was \u201cstabbed in the back\u201d in the process and disrespected as a close partner. It has argued it was told only at the 11th hour with no genuine opportunity for consultation.\nOne of the encounters of most contention is Morrison\u2019s meeting and dinner with Macron at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace in Paris in June.\nMorrison went to Paris just days after Morrison had his own trilateral meeting with Joe Biden and Boris Johnson on the sidelines of the G7 summit in Carbis Bay in the UK. (We now know the leaders of Australia, the US and the UK were talking about what would later become the Aukus arrangement.)\nWe know that Australia\u2019s concerns about the submarine programme were discussed between Morrison and Macron. Both sides also agree that Morrison raised concern over the deteriorating strategic environment in the Indo-Pacific region. But the two sides have different interpretations of what flowed from that.\nThe French ambassador, Jean-Pierre Th\u00e9bault, has previously told Guardian Australia that this wasn\u2019t meant to be the end of the conversation: \u201cThe prime minister, to our understanding, signalled that there were questions raised about the evolving situation in the region \u2026 but what was agreed is that this conversation would continue.\u201d\nHere\u2019s the account provided by Morrison when speaking to reporters in Glasgow on Monday: \u201cNow, at that point, I made it very clear that a conventional diesel-powered submarine was not going to meet Australia\u2019s strategic requirements. We discussed that candidly.\u201d\nBut Morrison told reporters it was not up to him to flag the emerging plan B (the US- and UK-backed nuclear-propelled submarines) at that stage: \u201cI did not discuss what other alternatives we were looking at. They were in confidence, and they were subject to the security arrangements we had about those other discussions.\u201d\nWith the benefit of hindsight, maybe a little hint. Speaking to reporters shortly after the meeting in Paris in June, Morrison did not rule out walking away from the project when the next contractual milestone was reached, but he also appeared to imply the sticking points were being resolved.\nMorrison said he appreciated the French president was \u201ctaking a very active role\u201d in resolving issues with the contract. \u201cPresident Macron and I have a very, very open and very transparent, and very friendly relationship where we can speak candidly to each other about these issues,\u201d Morrison said on 16 June.\nAsked whether he was leaving Paris more or less confident about the submarine program, Morrison said: \u201cI leave knowing that we have properly raised the challenges that we need to address, and so it is now for us to work forward on that basis.\u201d\nMorrison told reporters on Monday that the French defence system \u201cflew into action\u201d the day after the dinner at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e to seek to address issues with the project \u2013 including sending a French admiral to Australia \u201cto try and save the contract\u201d.\n\u201cSo if there was no concern about the contract being under threat, Admiral Morio would never have come to Australia,\u201d Morrison said.\nMorrison said the Australian government \u201ceventually formed the view that we would agree to disagree\u201d and that the French Attack class submarine \u201cwould not meet our requirements\u201d.\nYes. At the end of August, just two weeks before the Aukus announcement, Australian ministers Marise Payne and Peter Dutton met by video link with their French counterparts to herald ever-strengthening ties (it was the first ever \u201c2+2\u201d meeting between the two sides).\nAccording to the official joint statement \u2013 which were obviously agreed by France and Australia - the four ministers \u201cunderlined the importance of the future submarine program\u201d.\nThebault, the French ambassador, has said it\u2019s now apparent there was \u201cno sincerity in the discussion\u201d.\nFrance complained that one of the reasons it felt blindsided was because hours earlier Australian officials had informed the French contractor of progress on the submarine contract.\nIn the letter, sent on 15 September, the director general of the future submarine program confirmed the exit of a review of one aspect of the project \u201chas been achieved as required under the Submarine Design Contract\u201d. But the letter also included a caveat that the \u201cmatters addressed in this correspondence do not provide any authorisation to continue work\u201d.\nAt Senate estimates last week, the secretary of Australia\u2019s defence department, Greg Moriarty, said there had been \u201ca number of engagements with French officials about our thinking about capability requirements\u201d but added: \u201cI did not discuss cancellation of the Attack programme with any French official prior to the night before [the announcement].\u201d\nMoriarty described the reaction of Naval Group when briefed hours later as follows: \u201cThey were surprised and disappointed \u2013 understandably.\u201d\nHours before Morrison\u2019s press conference hitting back at Macron on Monday, Sydney\u2019s Daily Telegraph reported on the contents of a text message the prime minister received from the French president two days before the Aukus announcement. By this account, Macron messaged Morrison to say he was not available at the time Australia had requested a call and wrote\u201d: \u201cShould I expect good or bad news for our joint submarines ambitions?\u201d\nWhen asked on Monday why a decision was made to release the text message, Morrison said: \u201cI\u2019m not going to indulge your editorial on it.\u201d But Morrison added that the message \u201cmade it pretty clear that [Macron] was concerned\u201d that the contract was to be cancelled.\nThe release of the message appears to be designed to show the Aukus decision didn\u2019t come out of the blue. But another reading of it is that Macron didn\u2019t know \u2013 two days before \u2013 which way the Australian government was leaning. Morrison replied to Macron that it was important that the pair spoke. When a time couldn\u2019t be locked in, Morrison said he texted a letter outlining the decision to Macron.\nFrance is calling on the Australian government to propose \u201ctangible actions\u201d to heal the diplomatic rift.\nOn Monday the Australian foreign minister met for more than an hour with the French ambassador to start the process \u2013 but that effort may be undercut by some senior members of the government who have played down the significance of Australia\u2019s decision in theatrical terms, and now by Morrison\u2019s strong pushback at Macron\u2019s remarks.",

Mercola has said he has \u201cevery right to inform the public by sharing my medical research\u201d.\nFacebook came under pressure to ban Kennedy, the nephew of President John F Kennedy, in March when he released a documentary, Medical Racism, which has been accused of seeking to promote vaccine hesitancy among black Americans. Kennedy has said the film \u201cempowers all Americans to demand the safest vaccines\u201d.\nFacebook and Instagram are both owned by Meta, the company that until a rebranding last week was known as Facebook.\nAlex Cardier, the UK managing director for NewsGuard, said Facebook and Instagram were failing to protect their users from Covid-19 and vaccine misinformation despite having been warned \u201crepeatedly\u201d.\nHe said: \u201cThe company\u2019s engagement-at-all-costs mantra means that viral and divisive sources of misinformation continue to flourish, despite warnings from NewsGuard and the clear danger posed to users. Facebook gave itself a new name but their promotion of misinformation remains the same.\u201d\nA Meta spokesperson said the company was encouraging users of its platforms to get vaccinated and it was taking action against misinformation. \u201cDuring the pandemic we have removed more than 20m pieces of harmful misinformation and we\u2019ve taken down content identified in this report which violates our rules. In total we\u2019ve now banned more than 3,000 accounts, pages and groups for repeatedly breaking our rules. We\u2019re also labelling all posts about the vaccines with accurate information and worked with independent factcheckers to mark 190m posts as false.\u201d\nIn an effort to reassure users on the efficacy of vaccines, several of the Facebook pages highlighted by NewsGuard contained Facebook labels directing users to a WHO page on vaccines or the company\u2019s own Covid-19 information centre page.\nMeta announced last week that was stepping up efforts to promote vaccination efforts for children on its apps.",

        "content": "Rittenhouse shot three people, killing two, during protests last year in Wisconsin after a white police officer shot Jacob Blake\nThe trial of Kyle Rittenhouse began on Monday with the challenge of seating jurors who had not made up their minds about the young man who shot three people, killing two, during a violent night of protests in Kenosha, Wisconsin, last year.\nRittenhouse, now 18, faces life in prison if he is convicted of first-degree homicide. He faces two homicide counts, one of attempted homicide and two of recklessly endangering safety for firing his weapon near others. He is also charged with possession of a dangerous weapon by a person under 18.\nIn August 2020, Rittenhouse traveled from his home in Antioch, Illinois, to Kenosha, Wisconsin, armed with an AR-15-style rifle and in response to a Kenosha-based militia that called for protection for businesses against protesters supporting the Black Lives Matter movement.\nThe protests took place over several days, after a white police officer shot a Black man, Jacob Blake, in the back from close range, an incident caught on video and widely shared on social media.\nRittenhouse is white, as were the three men he shot, but many are watching his trial as the latest referendum on race and the US legal system.\nBy Monday evening, a jury of 20 people \u2013 12 jurors and eight alternates \u2013 had been selected in an all-day session that ran well past dark. The judge said he would decide at the end of the trial which ones were alternates and which ones would deliberate. The 20 consist of 11 women and nine men. Jurors were not asked to identify their race during the selection process, and the court did not immediately provide a racial breakdown of the group.\nBefore jury selection began, Bruce Schroeder, Wisconsin\u2019s longest-serving circuit court judge, had promised attorneys picking a pool from 150 prospective jurors the process could be accomplished in a day. The trial is expected to last two to three weeks.\nLast week, Schroeder ruled that those shot by Rittenhouse could not be referred to as \u201cvictims\u201d by prosecutors. Defense attorneys may, however, call them \u201carsonists\u201d or \u201clooters\u201d, Schroeder said.\n\u201cThe word \u2018victim\u2019 is a loaded, loaded word. And I think \u2018alleged victim\u2019 is a cousin to it,\u201d Schroeder said.\n\u201cLet the evidence show what the evidence shows. And if the evidence shows that any or more than one of these people were engaged in arson, rioting or looting \u2013 then I\u2019m not going to tell the defense they can\u2019t call them that.\u201d\nAccording to the Chicago Tribune, Schroeder also said Mark Richards, one of Rittenhouse\u2019s attorneys, could \u201cdemonize them [the shot men] if he wants, if he thinks it will win points with the jury\u201d.\nVictor Ray, a sociologist at the University of Iowa and Brookings fellow, criticized Schroeder, saying on Twitter: \u201cAs I\u2019m writing this book #oncriticalracetheory, it\u2019s becoming increasingly clear who is served by the illusion of neutral law.\u201d\nSpeaking to the Guardian last week, Ray added: \u201cCritical race theorists argue that racism is sometimes embedded in legal orders that purport to be neutral and unbiased.\n\u201cIn this case, a 17-year-old with an AR-15 crossed state lines and allegedly shot two protesters to death. These protesters were supporting the Black Lives Matter movement.\u201d\nRittenhouse fatally shot Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, after Rosenbaum chased Rittenhouse across a parking lot and threw a plastic bag at him shortly before midnight on 25 August. Moments later, as Rittenhouse was running down a street, he shot and killed Anthony Huber, 26, and shot and wounded Gaige Grosskreutz, 27.\nBystander video captured Rosenbaum chasing Rittenhouse but not the shooting. Video showed Huber swinging a skateboard at Rittenhouse. Grosskreutz had a gun in his hand as he stepped toward Rittenhouse.\nLawyers for both sides had urged Schroeder to send questionnaires to potential jurors to detect bias and speed the process, a request he denied. He nevertheless said that each side would be allowed to strike seven people.\nIn court on Monday, Schroeder told potential jurors 12 would deliberate and the rest would be dismissed.\nThe judge said he would almost certainly not sequester the jury, but stressed the responsibility of deciding the case solely on what was heard in the courtroom.\nTelling potential jurors the case \u201chas become very political; it was involved in the politics of the last election year\u201d, Schroeder also said inaccurate information had been written by people who \u201cdon\u2019t know what you\u2019re going to know, those of you who are selected for this jury, who are going to hear for yourselves the real evidence in this case\u201d.",

He and his client, the former intelligence officer Witness K, have been described as heroes of Timor-Leste for their actions, including by the former president Jose Ramos-Horta.\nLast month Collaery won a major battle in the ACT court of appeal to remove secrecy orders shrouding significant parts of his prosecution from the public. In a summary of its decision, the court cited the importance of open justice in preventing \u201cpolitical prosecutions\u201d.\n\u201cThe court emphasised that the open hearing of criminal trials was important because it deterred political prosecutions, allowed the public to scrutinise the actions of prosecutors, and permitted the public to properly assess the conduct of the accused person,\u201d the summary said.\nAlmost four weeks later, the court\u2019s full judgment has still not been published.\nOn Tuesday Australia\u2019s attorney general again intervened in the case, this time asking for significant parts of the judgment to be redacted, on grounds including national security.\nArguments for redactions took place briefly in open court. The court was then closed to the public and media to allow the attorney general, represented by Anna Mitchelmore SC, to fully make the case for suppressions.\nA Human Rights Law Centre senior lawyer, Kieran Pender, said the court of appeal had already made clear that secrecy in the Collaery case erodes public confidence.\n\u201cThe next step in this sorry saga should be to drop the charges altogether, not to argue for more secrecy, at a secret hearing, about a judgment that said no to a secret trial,\u201d he said.\nThe federal government has until Wednesday to tell the court whether it will appeal against the ACT court of appeal\u2019s ruling.\nGuardian Australia has asked Cash\u2019s office whether a decision to appeal has yet been made.\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nCollaery is facing five charges of disclosing protected intelligence information to ABC journalists and of conspiring with Witness K to communicate information to the Timor-Leste government.\nThe pair were helping Timor-Leste mount a case against Australia in the international courts, arguing that the Timor Sea agreement had been rendered void by Australia\u2019s spying.\nAustralia\u2019s domestic spy agency raided their homes in 2013. Witness K\u2019s passport was seized, preventing him from travelling to The Hague to give evidence.\nAfter Timor-Leste and Australia reached a new agreement on the Timor Sea, the Australian government signed off on a prosecution of Collaery and Witness K.",

The service is now used in more than 180 countries and by more than 30 million teachers and students, with its largest user-base in North America. Now, more than 90% of US schools are using the platform.\nLast week, the company secured the number one spot in the 2021 Deloitte Fast 50 index, with \u201ca remarkable 1,177% revenue growth over the past three years\u201d, according to Deloitte.\nLast year, Kami offered its software to teachers around the globe free of charge to help them continue to digitally reach students during the worst of the global pandemic.\nSales dried up overnight, the company\u2019s chief executive Wang said, but that turned around when teachers asked to start paying, to ensure the platform\u2019s future.\n\u201cFast forward 18 months, with that sort of massive shift in education, we saw maybe about five years\u2019 worth of growth in the market in one year.\u201d\nTo celebrate both this success and hitting the 30 million user mark, the company decided to reward its employees.\n\u201cOur team had been working incredibly long hours, made a lot of sacrifices over the last 18 months, supporting teachers and students globally.

But despite this we have shown the world that achieving this level of growth and the impact that we have is possible. Operating a cashflow-positive startup is possible.\n\u201cWe have shown that it is possible from little old New Zealand. Capital is not a barrier to growth and success.\u201d"

        "content": "Listening to the women who alleged abuse, and fighting to get their stories heard, helped change the treatment of victims by the media and the justice system\nOn Saturday 29 October 2011, the day the entertainer Jimmy Savile died aged 84, a couple of comments were posted on the Duncroft School page of the networking site Friends Reunited. Duncroft was designated as an \u201capproved school\u201d by the Home Office, and offered residential care for \u201cintelligent but emotionally disturbed girls\u201d. \u201cHe died today, RIP no RIH yes rot in hell,\u201d read one message. \u201cPerhaps some closure for the childhoods that were ruined by this animal.\u201d Over the next few days a handful more messages appeared: \u201cYou child molester \u2013 you were no better than all the other pervs who have been banged up \u2026 only your celebrity status saved you.\u201d Someone else wrote how she would never recover from what \u201cJS\u201d did to her.\nAcross the news bulletins and weekend front pages, Savile was being given a sendoff fitting for someone who had achieved national treasure status. As BBC Radio 1 DJ, and co-presenter of the BBC\u2019s flagship music programme Top of the Pops, Savile became a personality in the pop music scene in the 60s and 70s; his oddness and mannerisms enhanced his celebrity. As the host of the long-running Saturday evening TV show Jim\u2019ll Fix It, he played godfather, granting the wishes to children who wrote in. On the Monday after his death, during the news editors\u2019 9.15 morning meeting at BBC headquarters in west London, those present were asked to take coverage of Savile\u2019s funeral seriously. The concern was that the news editors might sneer at Savile; they were reminded that, to much of the audience, Savile was a northern hero. He had started out working in the mines, going on to earn a knighthood and befriend royalty through his television shows and charity work.\nMeanwhile, George Entwistle, the BBC\u2019s head of television, was trying to work out how BBC light entertainment would mark the death of one of its biggest stars. Entwistle was informed that there was no obituary ready to run on Savile \u2013 unusual for someone who had made such a contribution to British public life. The decision had been made by successive controllers, a colleague told him by email. Savile had a \u201cdark side\u201d, which meant it was \u201cimpossible to make an honest film to be shown so close to death\u201d, his colleague said.\nEntwistle emailed his team: the best way forward was to avoid making anything new about Savile. Someone suggested making a Fix It Christmas special hosted by a new BBC star. All agreed. Problem solved. It\u2019d be \u201ca real Christmas treat\u201d, said the BBC1 controller in an email.\nRumours about Savile being a sexual predator and a paedophile had persisted for decades. In his trademark brightly coloured shell suits, scant shorts and string vests, Savile had performed his perversions almost as much as he\u2019d hidden them. His manner almost dared people to challenge him. Because of the UK\u2019s punitive libel laws, no one ever had. On the Monday morning after Savile\u2019s death, in the Newsnight office at BBC Television Centre, social affairs correspondent Liz MacKean and producer Meirion Jones began to investigate Savile\u2019s history.\nJones had a personal connection to the story: his aunt ran the Duncroft School. Over three years in the early 1970s, when he was in his mid-teens, Jones visited Duncroft on weekends with his parents and his sister. They would often see Savile\u2019s white Rolls-Royce parked outside. His parents were concerned about Savile taking the girls off site. Jones met Savile there a few times, always finding it curious how he seemed to speak in catchphrases that created what Jones described as \u201ca screen between him and people around him\u201d.\nIn 1988, Jones became a journalist at the BBC. It soon became one of the stories he wanted to get a purchase on. Once social media arrived, he would search sites for references to Savile and Duncroft. In 2010, he found a memoir published online by a former Duncroft pupil, detailing abuse by a celebrity \u201cJS\u201d. Jones had spoken to MacKean at different times about pursuing the story, but they were at a disadvantage legally. Savile was part of the establishment, a leading charity fundraiser, and some of the Duncroft girls were offenders. Some had been abused from a young age, and had run away from care homes. No one would believe them against him. \u201cAny witness would be destroyed in court so we\u2019d never get it past the lawyers,\u201d Jones told me. \u201cIt\u2019s exactly why he targeted places like that.\u201d\nMacKean, then 46, from Hampshire, had two children and worked at Newsnight part-time. As a journalist she was drawn to people on the margins \u2013 people who\u2019d been wronged and couldn\u2019t get justice. \u201cShe was a lucky person, highly attuned to the unlucky and the unfair,\u201d MacKean\u2019s friend Amelia Bullmore wrote to me.\nWithin a few weeks of Savile\u2019s death, MacKean had collected on-the-record testimony from 10 women who had been at Duncroft. Seven had been abused and three had witnessed abuse by Savile. It had been difficult to convince them to go public. Some told her they worried they would be seen as complicit; they were sure they wouldn\u2019t be believed. Some feared a backlash, that people would claim they were out for something: compensation, notoriety. MacKean, a BBC journalist of 20 years\u2019 standing, assured the women that they\u2019d have the weight of Newsnight behind them, and the support of the BBC. But a few days before the transmission date, the Newsnight editor, Peter Rippon, told MacKean and Jones that the piece couldn\u2019t be broadcast.\nHe said they needed to focus on some kind of institutional failure. What about the police investigation that had been halted? MacKean told Rippon that the women\u2019s stories corroborated one another \u2013 they didn\u2019t need any other elements. It all stacked up. And on top of this, they had found institutional failure by the BBC. Some of the abuse had taken place on BBC premises, in dressing rooms in Television Centre, the very building in which they were standing.\nMacKean couldn\u2019t know the extent to which she\u2019d have to take on the BBC in order to make sure that the former Duncroft pupils were taken seriously. Nor could she know that she and Jones would be risking their careers. But in refusing to drop the story, they helped to change the culture about the way past sexual abuse is talked about, and survivors listened to, in the UK.\nThe BBC is now making a mini-series about Savile. One of the few details it has announced is that Steve Coogan will play Savile. Some viewers are uneasy about the BBC putting Savile back in the limelight, and have expressed concern about how people still living with the impact of his abuse will feel about it. But the BBC feels the time is right for a reckoning, and says the drama \u201cwill examine the impact his appalling crimes had on [Savile\u2019s] victims and the powerlessness many felt when they tried to raise the alarm\u201d.\nSavile\u2019s funeral was broadcast live on BBC News on 9 November 2011. The pavements around Leeds Cathedral were thick with mourners as his gold coffin was borne past. MacKean told the documentary maker Olly Lambert in 2014 that she watched this and thought: \u201cThe difference between that and the sort of things that people now felt able to start telling us \u2013 a gulf like that \u2013 that\u2019s a story.\u201d\nWorking with Jones and MacKean, BBC trainee Hannah Livingston tracked down about 60 former Duncroft pupils. Most immediately assumed the call would be about Savile. Those willing to talk were passed on to MacKean. Over long calls, MacKean began to understand how Savile masterminded the abuse. He would offer the girls cigarettes and trips to Television Centre in his Rolls-Royce. In return, they\u2019d have to give him oral sex in a layby.\nAmong the Newsnight editorial team there were some squeamish discussions about the Savile story. Jeremy Paxman, Newsnight\u2019s lead presenter for 25 years, whose rigorous, curmudgeonly questioning style defined the programme, told me: \u201cI think there were an awful lot of people who felt that it was at the tabloidy end of things.\u201d One member of the team wanted nothing to do with it on grounds of \u201ctaste\u201d. Some thought it was too close to Savile\u2019s death, and sensationalist. \u201cThat was one of the arguments deployed at the time,\u201d one former senior Newsnight journalist told me. \u201cNewsnight was meant to be serious, high-minded journalism about politics, economics, foreign affairs and culture, and this isn\u2019t what it should be doing.\u201d Rippon was initially enthusiastic about MacKean and Jones pursuing the Savile story, but, as MacKean told Jones in an email after a meeting she had with Rippon and a member of his editorial team, they were \u201c[of] course concerned about the credibility of the women\u201d.\nMacKean told Lambert in 2014, during a long interview that he recorded but never broadcast: \u201cThe women we spoke to were middle-aged. The fact that they\u2019d been in a school like Duncroft showed that their lives were on a difficult course. Perhaps they weren\u2019t the most appealing interviewees for television. There is, within the mainstream establishment, a dislike of those sorts of people, an official indifference, or they just find them difficult to deal with. I think that\u2019s why the BBC then found it so hard to admit that we were investigating Jimmy Savile, because there was a real embarrassment at admitting that the BBC, like all these other official institutions, had just shrugged its shoulders and turned away from people rather than listened.\u201d The BBC said in a statement: \u201cSavile\u2019s actions were profoundly wrong and we are sorry for the pain caused to his survivors \u2026 Today\u2019s BBC is a very different place, where complaints about any form of harassment are considered with the utmost seriousness.\u201d\nWhen MacKean arrived at Newsnight in 2000 after being a presenter on BBC Breakfast News, Jones had been producing investigations for the programme for five years. He noticed that she would get stories from people who didn\u2019t usually talk to journalists. \u201cYou could absolutely 100% trust her, and the women [from Duncroft] knew they could trust her too,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd she was totally unafraid.\u201d\nWhile MacKean was working on Savile, I was working as a freelancer, producing another investigation with her at Newsnight. When I first met her in the office that summer, she looked at my hands, saw they were covered in scratches and asked me if I had a kitten at home. Nobody asked questions like that on first meetings at Newsnight: not personal, not domestic, not about kittens. Newsnight was a tough environment, but MacKean was disarmingly herself. She drew people out. Over the next year I would watch MacKean fight for the Savile story, see how her work went unrecognised, how she was ignored and sidelined at the BBC, and how profoundly that affected her.\n\u201cShe\u2019d always struck me as a very ordinary journalist,\u201d a former senior news executive told me. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t ambitious or sharp-elbowed. She didn\u2019t fill the screen.\u201d I put it to him that MacKean\u2019s talents for listening to sources were one of the qualities that made her extraordinary. He considered this for a moment and said: \u201cListening wasn\u2019t a quality we gave much credit to back then. It should have been.\u201d\nIn 2010, Jones and MacKean won the Daniel Pearl award for investigative journalism for their report on Trafigura\u2019s toxic waste dumping in Ivory Coast, co-authored with the Guardian. Paxman told me: \u201cMeirion\u2019s like a dog with a bone. I always took it as read that if Meirion said something was true, it was true. Even though there might be very expensive lawyers for the other side, I always believed him. And he worked with Liz. They were not what you\u2019d call \u2018clubbable\u2019. I admired Liz very much. She was a difficult woman, but the best journalists very often are difficult.\u201d Because Jones and MacKean had been given freedom to get on with their work in the past, when their editor questioned whether they had done enough on the Savile story, it was a shock.\nOn Monday 14 November 2011, cameraman Simon Monk picked up MacKean, Jones and Livingston from a train station in the south of England and drove them to the home of the only one of Savile\u2019s victims they had spoken to who had agreed to record an interview on camera. Monk didn\u2019t know what the story was that he had been booked for. \u201cI\u2019ve often thought about that interview,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt stayed with me, you know, just little moments of it. I realised \u2013 I\u2019m listening to something that happened to this lady, that I was privy to something that had maybe never been shared before.\u201d\nIn the car on the way back, the team were quiet at first. Slowly they prompted one another\u2019s responses. They had all believed her. \u201cIt was subdued,\u201d Monk said, \u201cand I\u2019m thinking: we\u2019re at the beginning of something. The lid is being prised open on this. I\u2019ve worked there for a long time and seen how people have been dealt with, especially women in the Beeb.\u201d Monk turned on the car radio, and by coincidence the BBC Christmas schedule was being announced \u2013 including the Savile tributes. \u201cThey\u2019ll have to cancel those now,\u201d someone said.\nThe team were working to corroborate as many fine details as possible from their collection of quotes by the former Duncroft pupils. Rippon asked Jones and MacKean to confirm claims that the police had investigated Savile. On 25 November, Jones received confirmation that Surrey police had investigated Savile in 2007, and that a file had been passed to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). Rippon gave the story a transmission date of 7 December. He wrote it on the Newsnight whiteboard, which meant it was certain to be going on air.\nJones sent a draft version of MacKean\u2019s script to the BBC Impact team, which makes sure important stories are headlined on news bulletins across the network. The Impact department expected a lot of interest, and asked if MacKean could be available for live interviews across all BBC outlets on the day of transmission. Two minutes later, Rippon sent an email to his line manager: \u201cThe women are credible and have no motive for speaking to us other than they want the truth to be known \u2026 We also think that Sky are chasing the story too so we don\u2019t want to sit on it.\u201d\nRippon received a reply from his manager Stephen Mitchell, the deputy head of news, saying he\u2019d call later. At the 2012 inquiry into the BBC\u2019s conduct over the Newsnight investigation, both said they could not remember whether any subsequent conversation took place. Nick Pollard, chair of the inquiry, wrote in his review: \u201cThe inability of both \u2026 Mr Rippon and Mr Mitchell to provide any recollection of whether they did or did not speak and, if so, what was said, was frustrating.\u201d (When I approached Stephen Mitchell for comment about this, he said: \u201cI would refer you to the two inquiries carried out into these events and the published outcomes of these, as I recall the reports were clear on how the item was handled.\u201d)\nBut the next day, Rippon had pulled back. He emailed MacKean and Jones asking them to confirm if it was true that the CPS had dropped the case because of Savile\u2019s old age, as some of the Duncroft women had been told. \u201cThat makes it a much better story,\u201d he wrote to Jones and MacKean. \u201cOur sources so far are just the women.\u201d\nPollard quoted Rippon\u2019s testimony in his review: \u201cThe extent to which we had to rely on the testimony from [the on camera interviewee] was stark. She was the only victim in vision we had and would be the face of our allegations and I remained concerned about how well her testimony would stand up to the scrutiny it would get.\u201d\nMacKean, however, was enraged by that phrase \u201cjust the women\u201d. She walked into Rippon\u2019s glass-walled office, leaving the door open. \u201cLiz would have been grandstanding,\u201d Jones recalled, \u201cmaking sure the whole office could hear. He\u2019d have been looking at his toes. Liz, with big arm gestures, was saying: \u2018How dare you talk about \u201cjust the women\u201d?\u2019 \u2026 I don\u2019t remember whether I\u2019d ever seen her bawling out the editor before.\u201d\nMacKean asked Rippon to watch their interview with Savile\u2019s victim, but he refused. Pollard wrote in his review: \u201cMr Rippon told me: \u2018I don\u2019t think seeing the interview \u2026 seeing something with an eye \u2026 gives you any more help in making a judgment about whether something is true or not \u2026 I think the kind of concerns that I had, that I was weighing, would not have been swayed by having sat down and watched the interview.\u2019 I think this is a strange thing for a television news journalist and editor to say. Common sense and experience would surely suggest the opposite.\u201d\nRippon wiped the Savile story from the Newsnight whiteboard and told Jones and Mackean to stop work on it until they heard back from the CPS. They didn\u2019t stop. For them, the police investigation was superfluous. They had the story: Savile had been a paedophile and numerous institutions had facilitated his crimes. Jones hired a white Rolls-Royce and filmed it the next day pulling up outside Duncroft.\nMacKean and Jones were beginning to realise that Savile\u2019s abuse had taken place on a bigger scale than they\u2019d thought. \u201cBy then, we\u2019d also heard rumours about Broadmoor, and quite serious allegations about Stoke Mandeville [hospital],\u201d MacKean told Lambert. \u201cMeirion thought there could be 100 victims \u2026 I said, I don\u2019t know, but certainly dozens. And of course we\u2019d both wildly underestimated it, as it turned out. But there was certainly enough there to think, right, a lot of institutions have questions to answer: clearly the BBC, certainly the NHS, and also the Home Office.\u201d\nFor the next few days, the atmosphere in the Newsnight office was tense. MacKean and Jones quietly continued working on the story as they waited to hear back from the CPS. On 9 December that email came. The CPS said they had dropped the investigation into Savile because of lack of evidence.\n\u201cI knew that was the kill,\u201d Jones said.\n\u201cThis statement [from the CPS about lack of evidence] specifically denied the allegation that the investigation was dropped because of his age,\u201d Rippon later wrote in the Editors\u2019 blog on the BBC website. \u201cI felt it was significant the guidance was included and we had not established any institutional failure and I judged it weakened the story from a Newsnight perspective. I took the decision not to publish.\u201d\nThe Pollard review recorded that Rippon told them that \u201cthe decision to drop the Savile story was his, and his alone\u201d. Pollard found that there was no inappropriate pressure or interference from BBC senior management with the editorial decision not to broadcast the Savile Newsnight programme. MacKean had to ring the women she\u2019d convinced to trust her and tell them the story wasn\u2019t going on air.\n\u201cIt was crushing and disappointing, but I didn\u2019t accept it,\u201d MacKean told Lambert. \u201cNow she was on a mission to get this story out and to get the truth told, she really was,\u201d MacKean\u2019s wife, Donna Rowlands, told me. There were still a few weeks before Christmas, and MacKean wanted her sources\u2019 voices to be heard before the tributes could air. She leaked the cancellation of her Newsnight investigation to the press. Reporter Miles Goslett got hold of the story and pitched it to seven Fleet Street editors. All turned it down, also on grounds of taste, and because getting into a tussle with the BBC so close to Christmas would cause problems. Even with Savile dead, the story was too much for the British press at that time of year.\nOn Boxing Day evening, after the regional news and before the family film Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa, 5 million people tuned in to BBC One to watch the actor Shane Richie present the Jim\u2019ll Fix It Christmas special.\nIn the new year, MacKean and Jones, with more than four decades of service to the BBC between them, gave all their research on Savile to the BBC\u2019s rival, the commercial channel ITV. \u201cNow, obviously that doesn\u2019t make us feel very good as BBC journalists,\u201d MacKean told Lambert. \u201cBut given that by then, we really had the feeling that the BBC didn\u2019t want to run this story, the only chance for us to get it out was going to be through someone else.\u201d\nOn Wednesday 3 October 2012, ITV ran a documentary in their Exposure strand titled The Other Side of Jimmy Savile. Five women, two from Duncroft, spoke about how Savile had sexually assaulted them as underage girls. Not long into the 49-minute programme, the NSPCC helplines began to light up and didn\u2019t stop ringing. And so began a gradual national outpouring of people, mainly women, talking about their own experiences of past sexual abuse, by high-profile figures, or people in their communities, workplaces or families, which many had kept silent about for decades.\nThe weekend before the Exposure documentary aired, the tabloids had splashed on the Savile allegations. \u201cSensation as TV legend Jimmy Savile is accused of underage sexual assaults\u201d was the front page of the People. The broadsheets joined in, too, but their focus was specifically on Newsnight\u2019s dropped investigation: \u201cBBC ditched Newsnight investigation into Jimmy Savile,\u201d was the Times\u2019s headline. \u201cBBC denies cover-up over claims Savile targeted underage girls\u201d was the Independent\u2019s.\nTo tell the Savile story, the BBC had been looking for a case of contemporary institutional failure. By not running it, they had created one. MacKean and Jones were now greeted by cameras and a press mob every time they entered Television Centre. The BBC press office was doing all it could to deflect the story. It put out statements saying that Newsnight had been investigating Surrey police\u2019s Savile investigation, not Savile himself. On 2 October, Peter Rippon published the blog explaining his decision. \u201cNewsnight is not normally interested in celebrity expos\u00e9,\u201d he wrote. MacKean was horrified that the former Duncroft pupils, who\u2019d trusted her with painful stories, were being ignored once again by the BBC. And now her and Jones\u2019s work was being publicly undermined. In November, Chris Patten, then chair of the BBC Trust, and George Entwistle, since promoted to director general, were called before a House of Commons select committee to explain what had happened.\nJournalists were calling MacKean and Jones, wanting to know their side of the story. Jones ignored the calls at first. MacKean didn\u2019t. MacKean told Lambert: \u201cI remember I had a two-week period of journalists ringing up around the clock, knocking on my door at home, and there was absolutely no one at the BBC I could talk to or get any sort of advice from because we were seen as the enemy within. I remember driving home on Sunday and the phone going, and it was someone from one of the national newspapers to say that a senior member of BBC management had told him that the investigation had been run by a work experience person, and I almost drove off the road.\u201d\nThe BBC told me that after this year\u2019s investigation into Martin Bashir\u2019s 1995 Panorama interview with Diana, Princess of Wales, which identified profound failures in the application and oversight of editorial values, the BBC Board had commissioned the Serota review \u201cto look at how to further strengthen BBC processes and practices\u201d. The remit of the Serota review was to establish whether the BBC had learned from the mistakes of the past, and to consider whether current practice addressed the challenges that had arisen since 1995. It considered the BBC\u2019s oversight of, and accountability for, editorial decision-making processes; the mechanisms in place for staff and others to raise concerns about editorial issues; the effectiveness of the BBC\u2019s whistleblowing procedures; and the culture within the BBC that supported compliance with the BBC\u2019s editorial values and standards. The Serota review was published in late October, and one of its key findings was that many BBC employees \u201care apprehensive that speaking up could impact negatively on their career\u201d.\nBack in 2012, MacKean and Jones wrote to Rippon, Mitchell and Entwistle trying to correct what they felt were inaccuracies in the BBC\u2019s statements. But the same BBC lines kept appearing in the press. \u201cWe were feeling huge pressure from the machine basically saying: go along with what we\u2019re saying,\u201d Jones said. \u201cWe were under a lot of scrutiny. There was incredible stress on both of us. And then we decided to do something which meant we\u2019d incur the wrath of management, which was to make the [programme for] Panorama.\u201d\nMacKean and Jones had convinced Tom Giles, the editor of Panorama, the BBC\u2019s investigative current affairs programme, to make a programme about what had happened to Newsnight\u2019s Savile investigation. They handed over to Panorama all their emails and paperwork. MacKean and Jones were told by Panorama that a senior manager had said that if they gave interviews to Panorama, they\u2019d lose their jobs.\n\u201cWe stopped worrying about her BBC career,\u201d Rowlands, MacKean\u2019s wife, told me. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not just saying that. That was going to fall the way it fell. OK, it fell more disappointingly than we\u2019d hoped. But the important thing was that the women were heard \u2013 that was her number one. And then number two, that the truth was told about what the BBC had done, and the cover-up.\u201d\nThe BBC press office was split. Part of it promoted the Panorama programme that MacKean and Jones were speaking on, while the other put out the BBC\u2019s corporate reaction to the programme. \u201cIt was a baroque arrangement,\u201d one former senior BBC manager said.\n\u201cIt felt weird, like we\u2019d gone beyond the looking-glass,\u201d one former senior Newsnight journalist remembered, \u201cand we didn\u2019t quite know what the rules were. It was very tooth and claw. You could see there were desperate people among management.\u201d\nThe weekend before the Panorama investigation was broadcast, Jones received a call from a journalist with a \u201ctipoff\u201d that someone from the BBC press office had told him that the reason Newsnight hadn\u2019t run the Savile investigation was because Jones was trying to conceal the fact that his aunt had been complicit in Savile\u2019s abuse. Jones received official permission to deny it from senior news editor Peter Horrocks, who had come over from the World Service to take on editorial oversight of the Panorama film to avoid a conflict of interest, as senior BBC news managers were the subjects of its investigation. On 21 October, the Mail on Sunday ran the story, and noted that the \u201cBBC civil war intensified,\u201d as the BBC press office and a BBC journalist gave out information that entirely opposed each other.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just massive pressure,\u201d Jones told me, \u201cwhen it feels like all your bosses, the whole press office, were fighting a war against you. I would have collapsed over it if I had been on my own \u2013 and they would have got away with their pack of lies. But it felt like Liz and I were covering each other\u2019s backs. And there was never a feeling that Liz would crack. She was rock solid on this.\u201d\nOn Monday 22 October, the Panorama film, Jimmy Savile: What the BBC Knew, was broadcast on BBC One at 10.35pm. On the programme, MacKean said the BBC had been \u201cmisleading\u201d the public. Viewers watched as the BBC seemed to be criticising itself. Meanwhile, MacKean amplified her criticisms of what she saw as the BBC\u2019s deafness to the victims of past sexual abuse. She said: \u201c[The] women collectively deserved to be heard, and weren\u2019t heard, and that was a failure. We\u2019d convinced them to talk to us, we\u2019d believed them, and we let them down.\u201d\nRippon stepped down as the Newsnight editor a few hours before the Panorama film went out. (Pollard would later write in his review that Rippon was already \u201cbecoming something of a \u2018fall guy\u2019\u201d.) The BBC put out a statement saying that the BBC Newsnight investigation had not started out by looking at Surrey police. It was a small admission, but on that point the record had been corrected.\n\u201cWe were both pretty smashed up after all that,\u201d Jones told me. He remained on a short-term contract with Panorama while MacKean returned to Newsnight alone. \u201cOvernight my relationship with the BBC changed,\u201d MacKean told Lambert. \u201cAll of a sudden I was persona non grata, and people who knew me wouldn\u2019t talk to me. I\u2019d sort of sit down and all the usual chit-chat of an office seemed to just fall away.\u201d\nMacKean felt that for many in management, and colleagues who were fearful of management, she was now tainted. \u201cIt became a world where people were disappearing \u2013 you didn\u2019t know if all your bosses were going to be sacked,\u201d a former senior Newsnight journalist told me. He talked about the awkwardness of bumping into MacKean and Jones at the time: \u201cYou didn\u2019t know what to say. You didn\u2019t know what they wanted, or how far they wanted to take this.\u201d\nMacKean was hurt. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t a rebel. So to suddenly be so outside the tent was quite hard,\u201d Rowlands explained. \u2018She was so determined that all the truth would come out and all the people who\u2019d lied would be held accountable. But it suddenly put her in a position that wasn\u2019t comfortable for her. Because really, I mean, it sounds corny, but she was a team player. You know she\u2019d always liked the collegiate nature of the BBC.\u201d Her former colleague Jackie Long told me: \u201cIt was the one period in the time I knew her that she sounded at all fragile. That inner confidence was rocked.\u201d\nDee Coles was abused by Savile in his campervan when she was 14, while on holiday with her mother in Jersey. When she saw that the Exposure documentary was coming out, she noticed scepticism in some of the papers, and worried that the women coming forward wouldn\u2019t be believed. She wrote to the independent news production company, ITN, and in early October 2012 spoke about her own abuse by Savile on ITV news.\nShe felt MacKean and Jones\u2019s intervention on Panorama was crucial for building victims\u2019 confidence if they were going to come forward. \u201cNobody else was fighting that particular corner.\u201d Coles said she saw interviews with people who had been at the BBC when Savile was alive saying they hadn\u2019t seen anything, or there was nothing they could have done. \u201cAnd so it became massive that someone with a journalistic background who had nothing to gain and everything to lose said [that Savile abused children]. It underpinned the whole thing going forward, because otherwise it would just be a bunch of women saying \u2018me too\u2019 before it was hash-tagged. It was so courageous.\u201d\n\u201cA lot of how the BBC behaved was as other institutions behaved,\u201d MacKean told Lambert, \u201cwhether the courts, the police and NHS hospitals, even within families, people making the complaints are sidelined. They\u2019re disbelieved. And in that way, the BBC behaved exactly as other institutions did.\u201d\nA mental shift was now taking place. In a rushed attempt to catch up, Newsnight tried to do a film about another sexual abuse case involving a wealthy industrialist, based on victim testimony. But after the accuser said he got the wrong person, the BBC issued an apology. On 11 November 2012, Entwistle, the BBC director general, resigned.\nThe Pollard review was commissioned by the BBC to look into \u201cthe management by the BBC of a Newsnight investigation relating to allegations of sexual abuse of children by Jimmy Savile\u201d. Pollard, a journalist at Sky, took the chair on 16 October 2012 and collected testimony from all the BBC players involved. On 18 December 2012, he released his findings.\nMacKean and Jones turned up at the door to Pollard\u2019s press conference in Broadcasting House. A press officer stopped them from entering. \u201cWe were shocked,\u201d Jones said. \u201cBut we couldn\u2019t do anything about it.\u201d MacKean and Jones stood together at a television set in another part of the building and watched the press conference, live on the news, together. Pollard told the room: \u201cThe Newsnight investigators had got the story right. They had found clear and compelling evidence that Jimmy Savile was a paedophile. The decision by their editor to drop the original investigation was clearly flawed, though I believe it was done in good faith.\u201d\nAfter being barred from Pollard\u2019s press conference, MacKean and Jones decided to address the members of the media who were waiting on the forecourt outside Broadcasting House. A BBC press officer told them that their statements needed to be approved first by the acting head of BBC News. MacKean turned and said: \u201cI think you\u2019ll find they won\u2019t.\u201d She and Jones walked out through the revolving doors to the microphones and stood in front of the flashing cameras. MacKean said: \u201cI think the decision to drop our story was a breach of our duty to the women who trusted us to reveal that Jimmy Savile was a paedophile \u2026 Our editor didn\u2019t watch the interview with our main witness. Nick Pollard did, and found her credible and compelling, as did we \u2026 I welcome the recommendation that the BBC should trust its journalists.\u201d\nMacKean and Jones were both invited to individual meetings with the then-acting (and now current) director general of the BBC, Tim Davie. Jones said: \u201cWe were both half-expecting that he might say: \u2018We\u2019ve got new hands on the tiller, it\u2019s all going to change. Congratulations for going after that really important story. And \u2013 I\u2019m sorry.\u2019 But we got the opposite of that. It was new face, same suit.\u201d\nIn a statement, the BBC said: \u201cIn response to Pollard\u2019s findings, BBC management dealt with the issues appropriately at the time setting out a number of actions including the replacement of the senior editorial team at Newsnight; the introduction of regular reports from the Director-General to the BBC Management board about the highest risk programmes and investigations across the BBC.\u201d\nNewsnight moved into Broadcasting House in central London in mid-October 2012. The old Television Centre in White City had been sold, and would later be rebuilt into a complex of high-end apartments and restaurants. MacKean was asked to stay behind, sitting in Paxman\u2019s old chair, ready to present the programme should the satellite link fail in the new studio. MacKean called it the \u201cMiss Havisham\u201d role \u2013 she\u2019d done it before when presenters were on location. But as she sat there alone in the empty studio, an understudy, it was her story that made the headlines. The Metropolitan police had launched Operation Yewtree on 9 October to investigate Savile and other establishment figures, and 450 people would come forward to give testimony about being abused by Savile. The NSPCC said that in November and December 2012 it intervened to protect 800 more children than in a similar period in previous years. And since its establishment in 2013, the child sexual abuse review panel has sent 78% of cases referred to them to be reopened by the police or CPS because of flaws in the original investigations.\nMacKean and Jones had reframed the Savile story. It could no longer be dismissed as a celebrity sex expos\u00e9. Now the victims were at the centre. From that moment on, when women spoke out about past sexual abuse, the media, the police and the courts were prepared to listen.\n\u201cI think the scandal really did change things,\u201d a senior journalist told me. \u201cIn our world, the idea that you wouldn\u2019t run a story where you interviewed victims is now very unusual. Certainly if you have lots and lots of adult women saying something like that \u2013 you would run that story now. Weinstein was done partly by the New Yorker and the New York Times \u2013 the most heavyweight outlets in the world now do that kind of story.\u201d\nMacKean left the BBC in 2013. She went on to make award-winning documentaries for Channel 4\u2019s Dispatches, but she missed the daily grind of the news and her world at the BBC. In 2017, she and her friend and former Newsnight Northern Ireland producer Michael Hughes were watching the BBC\u2019s general election coverage together. \u201cLiz was sad about it,\u201d Hughes said. She wished she was mucking in, reporting the results with her colleagues on election night. \u201cShe always had her head held high, but I think she was sad that the Beeb hadn\u2019t fought harder to keep her.\u201d In August 2017, at the age of 52, MacKean had a stroke and died.\nI had seen how MacKean\u2019s sense of justice, courage and incisiveness had set off a chain of events that helped to bring justice, and reduce isolation, shame and repression for countless women across the UK and beyond. When I miss Liz\u2019s friendship, I look online for an account of what she helped to achieve through her work on Savile, but I can never find one.

Instead the first concrete was poured that year and the turkey is now scheduled for late 2026.\nIn the race against time to avert dangerous global heating, the UK government has decided to back an untried reactor from Rolls Royce. The first of these could be \u201cplugged into the grid by 2031\u201d, according to Nuclear Industry Association.\nInternationally average planning time for reactor proposals is 10 years, plus another decade for building, and that is for already proven designs. The 16 planned Rolls Royce reactors are still on the drawing board. The arguments about where they could be sited are beginning. Apart from other possible objections the favoured UK coastal locations are vulnerable to sea level rise, erosion and storms.\nFaced with the well-documented delays and drawbacks to nuclear programmes it is perhaps not surprising that there is no other country taking part in the Cop26 process in Glasgow relying on multiple new nuclear reactors to get to net zero carbon targets by 2050.

        "content": "Jean-Pierre Jeunet\u2019s fantastical romantic comedy made a star of Audrey Tautou and its distinctive visuals influenced a decade\u2019s worth of film-makers\nThere\u2019s a defining moment early in Jean-Pierre Jeunet\u2019s Am\u00e9lie when Am\u00e9lie Poulain (Audrey Tautou), a painfully shy and uncommonly adorable waitress at the Two Windmills cafe in Montmartre, arranges the return of childhood treasures to a middle-aged man who\u2019d hidden them in her apartment building 40 years earlier. She has gone through an exhaustive search to find this man, meeting all manner of eccentric Parisians along the way, but she eventually summons the right person to a phone booth and watches the tears roll down his cheeks as this tin full of trinkets unleashes a flood of memories.\nAs she glides blissfully through the frame, the narrator says, \u201cAm\u00e9lie has a strange feeling of absolute harmony. It\u2019s a perfect moment. A soft light, a scent in the air, the quiet murmur of the city. A surge of love, an urge to help mankind overcomes her.\u201d\nAm\u00e9lie is not really a film about love, as much as its heroine does to manufacture it for others \u2014 and finally, winsomely, for herself. And Am\u00e9lie is not really a film about altruism, either, given how much time she spends tormenting the nasty greengrocer (Urbain Cancelier) who abuses his sweet, simple-minded assistant (Jamel Debbouze). It\u2019s really a film about perfection, a fantasy about how a messy world can, through force of will and timing and deftness of touch, be harmonized down to the second. There\u2019s a mechanical quality to the film that\u2019s completely at odds with the spontaneity and surprise of authentic passion. That \u201cstrange feeling of absolute harmony\u201d is the metronomic ticking that Jeunet manufactures here \u2013 satisfying perhaps, but in no way romantic.\nYet 20 years later, Am\u00e9lie does feel like an important shift in film-making style, a natural bookend to Moulin Rouge earlier in the year. The medium was entering an era of extreme plasticity, where the world could be bended and refined down to the pixel, and engineered to achieve moments of pristine, storyboarded flawlessness. There\u2019s quite literally not a hair out of place in Am\u00e9lie \u2013 Audrey Tautou\u2019s immaculate bob is the greatest achievement in French hairdressing since Anna Karina\u2019s bangs in Vivre Sa Vie \u2013 but the cold order of the film should not be mistaken for swooning romanticism.\nAm\u00e9lie also recalls a classic Onion headline that predates it by two years: Romantic-Comedy Behavior Gets Real-Life Man Arrested. Among the details in the restraining order against this man is that he\u2019d stalked a woman for two months, spied on her and tapped her phone, and \u201ctricked her into boarding Caribbean-bound jets\u201d. Am\u00e9lie may have a more delicate touch and a timidness that relegates her to the sidelines of her own life, but the film celebrates a quirkiness that\u2019s millimeters away from derangement, as she makes elaborate interventions on people\u2019s lives and teases the man she desires with Rube Goldberg contraptions that don\u2019t pay off until she\u2019s ready.\nTo a degree, Jeunet\u2019s Paris doesn\u2019t need Am\u00e9lie to syncopate to a pleasing rhythm, as he delights in the random, unrelated events around the fertilization that led to her birth nine months later. Raised as an only child whose sole friend is a \u201csuicidal fish\u201d that leaps out of its bowl, Am\u00e9lie grows into a passive, self-effacing adult who comes to realize that she can shape the destinies of those around her without making herself visible. And so, she returns those childhood trinkets to the middle-aged man. And she persuades the hypochondriac cashier (Isabelle Nanty) at the cafe to take notice of the regular (Jeunet favorite Dominique Pinon) who always sits across from her station. And she honors her father\u2019s dreams of world travel by stealing his garden gnome and having a flight attendant send back Polaroids of the gnome at various landmarks. And she gets a key to the mean grocer\u2019s apartment and messes with his head by switching his toothpaste with foot cream or swapping out his slippers for a pair a few sizes too small.\nAnd on and on and on. Am\u00e9lie inevitably takes an interest in arranging happiness for herself when she spots a handsome young man named Nino (Mathieu Kassovitz), who has made a hobby out of collecting discarded shots from under photo booth machines. Their courtship is all gestures and delayed gratification, all so beautifully staged that the audience is never invited to imagine what a real relationship between the two of them might be like. It is the ultimate romantic comedy in that respect, imagining nothing worse than a series of contrived obstacles keeping two people from a future of uncomplicated bliss.\nIt\u2019s an extremely seductive fantasy for many, buoyed by the undeniable brio of Jeunet\u2019s film-making. The difference is that Jeunet\u2019s previous fantasies with co-director Marc Caro, the 1991 black comedy Delicatessen and the surrealist 1995 science-fiction City of Lost Children, have a much darker tone to bring them back down to earth. There\u2019s no doubt that Jeunet succeeds in turning this hidden corner of Montmartre, relegated mostly to the denizens of an apartment building and a cafe, into a community of oddballs bound closely together by dazzling orchestration. The experience intends to be a sustained magic act, but it\u2019s more often sickly sweet.\nAs Am\u00e9lie, Tautou does well to suggest the loneliness and fear at the core of her character while still inviting the audience to play co-conspirator to her behind-the-scenes machinations. But Jeunet doesn\u2019t appreciate her human dimension, to say nothing of the other characters, who are defined by silly likes and dislikes and weird patterns of behavior, but feel similarly trapped in his grand design. It\u2019s hard not to feel manipulated by Jeunet in the same elfin way his heroine intervenes in people\u2019s lives. The intent may be benevolent, but you\u2019re still getting jerked around.",

While the French government claims it was blindsided by the move, the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, maintains he acted appropriately and in the country\u2019s national interests.\nAhead of the G20 summit in Rome, the US president, Joe Biden, publicly observed to the French president, Emmanuel Macron, that the episode had been \u201cclumsy\u201d.

It also said the bank provided $200m to MEG Energy, which extracts Canadian tar sands oil, one of the most polluting fuels on the planet.\nThe report also revealed how HSBC and Standard Chartered participated in a $6bn bond issuance to Saudi Aramco, the world\u2019s most polluting company, and that HSBC financed a $1.5bn bond to Qatar Petroleum, which owns the world\u2019s biggest gas field.\nThe three banks have extended financing to fossil fuel companies despite committing to net zero carbon emissions from financing activity by 2050 and issuing warnings that no new fossil fuel projects are compatible with keeping global heating in check.\nThe report\u2019s findings came ahead of a series of Cop26 events scheduled for Wednesday that are intended to mobilise public and private finance to help tackle the climate emergency.\nMia Watanabe, a campaigner at Market Forces, said: \u201cDespite their warm words, these banks continue to finance fossil fuel companies and projects that are destroying the world\u2019s hopes of meeting climate targets.\u201d\nIn a stunt to mark the latest report, Market Forces held a Formula One-style \u201cprize giving\u201d for the banks\u2019 \u201crace to disaster\u201d outside Barclays\u2019 Glasgow offices, which is a stone\u2019s throw from the Cop26 venue.\nA previous annual report by the group that tracked global fossil fuel financing found that in the five years after the signing of the Paris agreement, the three banks combined financed more than $257bn in the coal, oil and gas sectors.\nThat report found Barclays was the world\u2019s seventh-biggest fossil fuel funder, and the biggest in Europe, while HSBC was ranked 13th in the world. Although Standard Chartered trailed at 34 globally, it is also the top UK financier of new coal plants in Asia, according to Market Forces.\nThe latest report follow news that Jes Staley has stepped down as the chief executive of Barclays after an investigation by City regulators into how he described his relationship with the billionaire sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\nStandard Chartered said last week that it would set \u201cambitious new targets\u201d to reach net zero from financed activity by 2050, including interim 2030 targets for the most carbon-intensive sectors, that were aligned with the International Energy Agency\u2019s scenario for a net zero energy system by 2050.\nThe global energy watchdog said in May that there could be no new oil, gas or coal development if the world was to reach net zero by 2050. Only days later a UN report warned that fossil fuel production planned by the world\u2019s governments \u201cvastly\u201d exceeded the limit needed to keep the rise in global heating to 1.5C and avoid the worst impacts of the climate crisis.\n\u201cThe science is clear \u2013 banks that keep funding fossil fuels can\u2019t be climate leaders,\u201d Watanabe added.\nAn HSBC spokesperson said the bank was \u201cfirmly committed\u201d to aligning its provision of finance to net zero by 2050 or sooner. \u201cWe have committed to phase out thermal coal financing by 2030 in EU and OECD markets and by 2040 globally and to set out short and medium-term transition targets for the oil and gas and power and utilities sector. We expect to provide between $750bn and $1trn towards the net zero-transition by 2030,\u201d the spokesperson added.\nA Barclays spokesperson said: \u201cWe are aligning our entire financing portfolio to support the goals of the Paris agreement \u2013 significantly scaling up green financing, directly investing in new green technologies and helping clients in key sectors change their business models to reduce their climate change impact. By 2025, we will reduce the emissions intensity of our power portfolio by 30%, and reduce absolute emissions of our energy portfolio by 15%.\u201d\n This article was amended on 3 November 2021 to include a statement from Barclays that was not available at the time of publication.",

Morrison rejected the claim and said he was \u201cnot going to cop sledging of Australia\u201d.\nSydney\u2019s Daily Telegraph and the Australian Financial Review reported Macron had texted Morrison two days before the Aukus announcement in mid-September to say: \u201cShould I expect good or bad news for our joint submarines ambitions?\u201d\nThe leaked message \u2013 shared to reinforce Australia\u2019s position that France wasn\u2019t blindsided about the cancellation of the A$90bn submarine deal \u2013 also appeared to confirm Macron did not know which way Australia would go shortly before Aukus was unveiled.\nIt was also reported Macron told Morrison in June, \u201cI don\u2019t like losing,\u201d after the Australian prime minister raised concern in Paris about whether the 12 planned conventionally powered submarines were still suitable for Australia\u2019s strategic needs.\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nLabor\u2019s foreign affairs spokesperson, Penny Wong, said Morrison was \u201cwilling to trash alliances and partnerships for personal political interests, instead of simply admitting this could have been handled better\u201d.\n\u201cMr Morrison needs to explain how selective text messages between him and the French president, and the contents of a confidential 15-page document negotiated in secret between President Biden\u2019s National Security Council and Australian and British officials ended up in Australian newspapers,\u201d Wong said.\n\u201cMr Morrison needs to rule out that this backgrounding came from him, his office or his government. His furious attempts at damage control will only make world leaders trust him less.\u201d\nMorrison\u2019s office on Tuesday declined to respond to Wong\u2019s comments, pointing to the prime minister\u2019s comments a day earlier.\n \nEmail:\u00a0sign up for our\u00a0daily morning and afternoon email newsletters\nApp:\u00a0download our free app\u00a0and never miss the biggest stories\nSocial:\u00a0follow us on YouTube,\u00a0TikTok,\u00a0Instagram,\u00a0Facebook\u00a0or\u00a0Twitter\nPodcast:\u00a0listen to our daily episodes on\u00a0Apple Podcasts,\u00a0Spotify\u00a0or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app\nMorrison was asked in Glasgow on Monday: \u201cWhy did you decide to leak that text message?\u201d\nThe prime minister did not directly contest the claim, but said he didn\u2019t intend to \u201cindulge your editorial on that\u201d.\nMorrison told reporters Macron \u201cwas concerned that this would be a phone call that would result in the decision of Australia not to proceed with the contract\u201d.\nMorrison said the French defence system \u201cflew into action\u201d the day after his dinner with Macron at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace in June to seek to address issues with the project \u2013 including sending a French admiral to Australia \u201cto try and save the contract\u201d.\nThe French embassy in Canberra did not comment on the release of the text message, although the ambassador, Jean-Pierre Th\u00e9bault, is due to address the National Press Club on Wednesday.\nComment has also been sought from the US embassy and the White House.\nEarlier, a senior White House official declined to clarify who Biden was referring to when he told Macron in Rome last week: \u201cI was under the impression that France had been informed long before that the deal was not going through. I, honest to God, did not know you had not been.\u201d\nBiden\u2019s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan \u2013 when asked on Monday about Morrison\u2019s handling of the matter \u2013 replied: \u201cWe should look forward and not backward.\u201d\nHerv\u00e9 Lemahieu, the research director at the Sydney-based Lowy Institute, said Australia had every right to decide to rescind the French contract and to enter into Aukus, but the communication with France \u201ccould have been handled with a bit more deft and diplomacy\u201d.\nLemahieu said the alleged release of the texts was \u201chighly unconventional behaviour between state leaders\u201d and reflected \u201chow personalised the squabble has become\u201d.\n\u201cI think the key variable here is that both president Macron and prime minister Morrison are two men who face elections in 2022, and they both see the fracas as a blow to their prestige and their personal standing and they are primarily speaking to a domestic audience here, rather than to each other.\u201d\nLemahieu said he had been monitoring French news stories in recent days \u201cand this is a bigger story in Australia than it is in France\u201d.\nHe said the handling of the communications with France was \u201cas much an American mismanagement as an Australian one\u201d \u2013 as the US is a formal treaty ally of France.\nLemahieu said Biden had \u201cbasically decided that it was worth pushing Australia under the bus in order to salvage\u201d the US relationship with France.\nThe former Liberal prime minister Malcolm Turnbull \u2013 who announced the partnership with France to acquire submarines in 2016 \u2013 said Morrison \u201cshould apologise\u201d to Macron \u201cbecause he did very elaborately and duplicitously deceive France\u201d.\nThe former Labor prime minister Kevin Rudd said the situation had become an \u201cextraordinary mess\u201d where \u201cwe now have got heads of government, effectively, leaking against each other, in order to establish what transpired in these informal text messages between heads of government\u201d.\n\u201cMr Morrison is now digging an even bigger hole for himself, not just in relation to the French, by effectively himself accusing the French president of lying, but also (in) extraordinary background briefing about the failure in Mr Morrison\u2019s view of American officials to properly apprise the United States president of the nature of the cancellation of the French deal,\u201d Rudd told the ABC.",

The Australian Hotels Association, meanwhile, has reported that pubs and restaurants are doing a roaring trade.\nA major report released by Gambling Research Australia in October found 16.8% of Australians gambled on horse races in the past year, down from 22.4% a decade before. But turnover keeps increasing, from $22.9bn in 2010-11 to $26.9bn in 2018-19 (adjusted for inflation).\nCQUniversity senior postdoctoral fellow in the experimental gambling research laboratory, and co-author of the report, Dr Alex Russell, says the apparent discrepancy is due to people turning off gambling, but those left behind being the heavy gamblers.\n\u201cThe people who are still betting are betting a tonne,\u201d Russell said. \u201cA lot of that is driven by more and more online gambling \u2013 it doubled in the past decade.\u201d\nRussell said people have realised that gambling is not just a harmless recreational activity but something with damaging effects on people and animals.\n\u201cWe\u2019re just seeing more and more people saying \u2018I bloody hate gambling\u2019, or \u2018I\u2019m sick of all the ads\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cThe other thing about the Melbourne Cup and horse racing is it comes with the animal cruelty issue.\u201d\nThere have been seven horse deaths in the past six years at the big race, prompting Racing Victoria to introduce new safety measures. Animal rights protesters targeted it again this year, joined \u2013 inexplicably \u2013 by anti-lockdown activists.\nIn an article in The Conversation, Russell pointed to an analysis of Melbourne Cup tweets last year that had #nuptothecup, #horseracingkills and #animalcruelty in the top 10.\nAttendances at the Cup were steadily declining before Covid changed everything. From a high of 122,736 (when Makybe Diva won in 2003), the numbers hovered at just over 100,000 in the early 2010s before sinking to 83,471 in 2018 then 81,408 in 2019.\nCovid meant there were no spectators last year and a cap of 10,000 people this year.\nTelevision audiences have also been declining, the Nine papers reported last year, although Channel 10 said people were live-streaming the event instead.\nGerard Daffy from online sports betting site TAB said the cup might have \u201clost a bit of its gloss\u201d, blaming an increasing number of international entries. But, thanks to the pandemic, Australians are dominating again. He said Incentivise (the pre-race favourite who came second behind Verry Elleegant) was a \u201cheadline act \u2026 a horse from Queensland that\u2019s come from obscurity\u201d.\n\u201cThe Melbourne Cup\u2019s the Melbourne Cup,\u201d Daffy said. \u201cIt\u2019s the race that stops the nation, it truly does, and it always will.\u201d\nThe Australian Hotels Association chief executive officer, Stephen Ferguson, said while race-day crowds were on \u201can inchingly slow decline\u201d, pubs and restaurants had held their ground. That was true this year, bearing in mind capacity restrictions, he said.\n\u201cThe Melbourne Cup is the starting gun for the run into Christmas,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt always is. It\u2019s one of the biggest days of the year. It\u2019s a festive day, full of bookings. People are social animals, they\u2019re looking to get out there and connect. Who wants to get on a train to Flemington when you can sit in a pub?\u201d\nRussell said for many people, Melbourne Cup betting was just a once-yearly bit of fun.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an excuse to take the day off, go to the pub, get dressed up,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s still got that about it, but a lot of people have had their eyes opened to all the stuff around it.\u201d\nIn Australia, Gambling Help Online is available on 1800 858 858.

The Games are due to take place in Beijing in February.\n\u201cOur members\u2019 repeated inquiries towards [Beijing Organising Committee for the Olympic Games] on how international media can report on the Games have been met with conflicting answers or neglected completely,\u201d the FCCC said.\n\u201cFCCC members report spending weeks trying to obtain contact details for BOCOG media facilitators, only to receive dismissive or inaccurate information from them.\u201d\nThe FCCC said in the past year foreign journalists had been largely unable to access press conferences or events that were open to domestic media, including the arrival of the Olympic flame. It said many press dates were not publicised, or announced with only a few hours\u2019 notice.\n\u201cForeign journalists who attempt to register for events are denied because BOCOG limits attendance to only their chosen media outlets, claim the event is full, or because they require participants to submit Covid test results within an impossible timeframe of only a few hours.\u201d\nThe FCCC provided several testimonies, including from a US journalist who said they were stopped and questioned by police after they tried to take photos with their phone of a venue, from a public road.\nAnother broadcaster said it was called by an organiser of an Olympic venue tour and shouted at over a report that mentioned human rights boycotts. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been given access since,\u201d the broadcaster said.\nA European newspaper reporter who attempted to visit venues after BOCOG failed to grant access was stopped at the entrance to winter sports slopes in Chongli and Yanqing. \u201cThis lack of access means Chinese state media claims about the environmental sustainability of venues are impossible to verify,\u201d the reporter said.\nThe FCCC said the conditions for visiting accredited foreign journalists were also unclear, including whether they would be allowed to travel within and outside Beijing, and what quarantine measures were required of them.\nChina is committed to a zero-Covid strategy and has enacted a \u201cclosed loop\u201d management system for the Games, within which all participants and employees can only move between Games-related venues for training, competitions and work on a dedicated transport system.\nChina\u2019s relationship with international media has plummeted in recent years. Many in-country positions \u2013 including for major outlets such as the New York Times, Washington Post, and Wall Street Journal, and all Australian outlets \u2013 remain empty after Beijing expelled or forced out dozens of reporters in 2020. It has since processed very few visa applications for journalists outside China hoping to go in, and dozens remain outstanding, leaving outlets with inadequate teams to cover the event.\nThe FCC called on the BOCOG to provide transparency and clarity for international media, process outstanding visas, improve access and permission to press events and venues, and to appoint dedicated media communications officers who provide real assistance.\n\u201cWith less than three months remaining before the start of Beijing 2022, there is still tremendous uncertainty over how and if foreign correspondents will be able to cover the Games,\u201d the FCCC said.\nThe BOCOG has been contacted for a response.",

This is about protecting cops from dying\u201d from Covid, which has killed almost 500 officers in the United States over the last two years, about five times the number who died from gunfire, according to the non-profit Officer Down Memorial Page.\nOn Monday, New York began enforcing its vaccinate mandate for city employees, which meant about 9,000 people who refused to get the vaccine were placed on unpaid leave, representing about 6% of the city workforce, according to NPR.\nMayor Bill de Blasio said on Monday that 91% of city employees had been vaccinated, the New York Times reported. That included the New York police department, the largest in the country, in which 85% of officers have been vaccinated, up from 70% just a couple of weeks ago. Other cities, including Seattle and Los Angeles, have seen the same increase in vaccinations before mandate deadlines, as workers decide they would rather get the shot than lose their jobs or be placed on unpaid leave.\nIn Seattle, 92% of the police department is fully vaccinated, according to the city. Twenty-two employees are partially vaccinated, and 100 others have requested an exemption.\nTo combat the staffing shortfall, Seattle\u2019s mayor, Jenny Durkan, announced last week that the city would begin offering a $25,000 hiring bonus to experienced officers or 911 dispatchers.\n\u201cWe are encouraged by the mayor\u2019s support because we have been pursuing hiring incentives,\u201d Huserik said.\nBut Mike Solan, president of the Seattle Police Officers Guild, condemned Durkan\u2019s announcement, telling Fox News that she had already betrayed police officers by implementing the vaccine mandate and not supporting them during protests after George Floyd was killed in 2020.\nDespite the fierce battles over vaccine mandates, public health experts say they are effective.\n\u201cAs the deadline for the mandate gets closer, even people who said initially they are not going to get the vaccine, they begin to move and do get vaccinated,\u201d said Sandra C Quinn, a professor of family science at the University of Maryland School of Public Health who has studied the role of communication in vaccine acceptance.\nAdam Galinsky, a social psychologist and expert in leadership and ethics at Columbia University, said the last-minute decisions to get vaccinated could be attributed to people\u2019s tendency to avoid actions they might later regret. With a mandate, the decision is somewhat taken out of their hands.\n\u201cMandates work \u2013 especially mandates around public health,\u201d Galinsky said. \u201cEven when people whine \u2026 and say they are going to quit, most people don\u2019t.\u201d\nDespite the uptick due to the mandates, some public health experts worry about the long-term consequences of the requirements on healthcare and society, including potentially greater opposition to other vaccines, said Katrin Schmelz, a behavioral economist and psychologist at the University of Konstanz.\n\u201cVaccination mandates will increase vaccination rates and on the other side of the scale, it could increase hostility towards the government and aggression and affect compliance with other Covid measures,\u201d said Schmelz, who lives in Germany, which does not mandate Covid vaccines. \u201cIt\u2019s not just: we enforce [the mandate] and are on the safe side, and all the problems are solved.\u201d",

We really need to make a good quality mapping of that area to make sure that we cover every inch.\u201d\nBlanch said the initial search focused on looking for Cleo if she had potentially wandered off. \u201cNow we are in a stage where we need to forensically go over that ground inch by inch to see what disturbances might be in the nearby areas for any sort of evidence that might give an inkling as to what happened,\u201d he said on Tuesday.\nAuthorities are conducting line searches too. WA police had previously said there was nothing to suggest the account given by Cleo\u2019s parents was anything but \u201caccurate and truthful\u201d. Guardian Australia is not suggesting they were involved in Cleo\u2019s disappearance.\nMore than 50 cubic metres of rubbish has been collected from bins stretching as far south as Geraldton, more than 500km from where Cleo vanished, and as far north as Minilya, 165km away.\nWA police believe Cleo may have been abducted, with the state government offering a $1m reward for any information that helps them find the people or person responsible for her disappearance.\nThe rubbish was packed into trucks and transported to Perth where four forensics officers and 20 officers spent days sorting through hundreds of bags \u200b\u200bin an effort to find any items that may assist in the investigation.\nThe search of the rubbish was \u201cstill going on today and will take a while to get through,\u201d Blanch said on Tuesday.\nHe said police were still looking for a vehicle they believed turned off Blowholes Road about 3.30am on the day Cleo went missing and drove south towards Carnarvon along the coast road.\nThe acting commissioner said it was thought to be a \u201csmaller passenger-type vehicle\u201d. That sighting remained a \u201csignificant focus of the investigation,\u201d he said.\nBlanch said given the remoteness of the area there were some potential routes from the campsite to Carnarvon without any CCTV coverage.\nAsked if Cleo could have been watched or followed at the campsite, he said investigators were keeping an open mind so \u201call avenues are still a possibility\u201d.\nBut the detective leading the investigation, Det Supt Rod Wilde, believes she was likely taken by an \u201copportunistic\u201d offender.\nWilde said on Tuesday the family had stayed near their tent all evening and had not socialised with other campers.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s more than likely an opportunistic-type event,\u201d he told Perth radio 6PR. \u201cWe know they got there on the Friday night, it was getting dark, and there would have been limited opportunity for people to observe Cleo at that time.\u201d\nThere are 100 people on the taskforce searching for Cleo \u2013 50 locally and 50 in Perth. The working theory is that she was still in WA because it was a \u201chigh-risk proposition\u201d someone would try and take her out of the state, Blanch said.\nHe called on people in the community to look out for anyone they knew behaving strangely \u201cor a little bit off\u201d after 16 October.\nThe acting commissioner said it was difficult to remain hopeful as the search dragged on but investigators were \u201cfocused absolutely on this case trying to bring Cleo home\u201d.\nCrime Stoppers have had 200 possible sightings of Cleo since she went missing and members of the public have come forward with hours of CCTV and dashcam footage in the hope that it helps.\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\n\u201cIt\u2019s been two weeks since four-year-old Cleo Smith was last seen, and while the search for answers continues we\u2019d like to take a moment to thank the public for their ongoing assistance, attention and support for the investigation,\u201d WA police said in a statement on Sunday.\n\u201cThis investigation could not progress without new information, and we\u2019re receiving that every day from people who want to help, who want to see Cleo return home to her family.\u201d\n- with Australian Associated Press",

        "content": "Delphi, an online AI bot, promises to answer any moral question users pose. We put it to the test\nCorporal punishment, wearing fur, pineapple on pizza \u2013 moral dilemmas, are by their very nature, hard to solve. That\u2019s why the same ethical questions are constantly resurfaced in TV, films and literature.\nBut what if AI could take away the brain work and answer ethical quandaries for us? Ask Delphi is a bot that\u2019s been fed more than 1.7m examples of people\u2019s ethical judgments on everyday questions and scenarios. If you pose an ethical quandary, it will tell you whether something is right, wrong, or indefensible.\nAnyone can use Delphi. Users just put a question to the bot on its website, and see what it comes up with.\nThe AI is fed a vast number of scenarios \u2013 including ones from the popular Am I The Asshole sub-Reddit, where Reddit users post dilemmas from their personal lives and get an audience to judge who the asshole in the situation was.\nThen, people are recruited from Mechanical Turk \u2013 a market place where researchers find paid participants for studies \u2013 to say whether they agree with the AI\u2019s answers. Each answer is put to three arbiters, with the majority or average conclusion used to decide right from wrong. The process is selective \u2013 participants have to score well on a test to qualify to be a moral arbiter, and the researchers don\u2019t recruit people who show signs of racism or sexism.\nThe arbitrators agree with the bot\u2019s ethical judgments 92% of the time (although that could say as much about their ethics as it does the bot\u2019s).\nIn October, a New York Times piece about a writer who potentially plagiarized from a kidney donor in her writing group inspired debate. The bot obviously didn\u2019t read the piece, nor the explosion of Reddit threads and tweets. But it has read a lot more than most of us \u2013 it has been posed over 3m new questions since it went online. Can Delphi be our authority on who the bad art friend is?\nOne point to Dawn Dorland, the story\u2019s kidney donor. Can it really be that simple? We posed a question to the bot from the other perspective \u2026\nThe bot tries to play both sides.\nI asked Yejin Choi, one of the researchers from University of Washington, who worked on the project alongside colleagues at the Allen Institute for AI, about how Delphi thinks about these questions. She said: \u201cIt\u2019s sensitive to how you phrase the question. Even though we might think you have to be consistent, in reality, humans do use innuendos and implications and qualifications. I think Delphi is trying to read what you are after, just in the way that you phrase it.\u201d\nWith this in mind, we tried to pose some of the great questions of politics, culture and literature.\nThe bot does answer some questions with striking nuance. For example, it distinguishes whether it is rude to mow the lawn late at night (it is rude), versus whether it is OK to mow the lawn late at night when your neighbor is out of town (it is OK). But previous versions of the bot answered Vox\u2019s question \u201cIs genocide OK\u201d with: \u201cIf it makes everybody happy.\u201d A new version of Delphi, which launched last week, now answers: \u201cIt\u2019s wrong.\u201d\nChoi points out that, of course, the bot has flaws, but that we live in a world where people are constantly asking answers of imperfect people, and tools \u2013 like Reddit threads and Google. \u201cAnd the internet is filled with all sorts of problematic content. You know, some people say they should spread fake news, for example, in order to support their political party,\u201d she says.\nSo you could argue that all this really tells us is whether the bot\u2019s views are consistent with a random selection of people\u2019s, rather than whether something is actually right or wrong. Choi says that\u2019s OK: \u201cThe test is entirely crowdsourced, [those vetting it] are not perfect human beings, but they are better than the average Reddit folk.\u201d\nBut she makes clear that the intention of the bot is not to be a moral authority on anything. \u201cPeople outside AI are playing with that demo, [when] I thought only researchers would play with it \u2026 This may look like an AI authority giving humans advice which is not at all what we intend to support.\u201d\nInstead, the point of the bot is to help AI to work better with humans, and to weed out some of the many biases we already know it has. \u201cWe have to teach AI ethical values because ai interacts with humans. And to do that, it needs to be aware what values human have,\u201d Choi says.\n The photo with this story was replaced on 10 November 2021 to show a cast of The Thinker at the Rodin Museum in Paris, as captioned, rather than a cast at Legion of Honor museum, San Francisco.",

        "content": "Robyn Lively is fantastic as tough-but-vulnerable Charlie, reeling from the disappearance of her daughter, but the storyline lets her down\nWith this small-town gothic murder mystery director and co-writer Lauren Fash overdoes it with the missing-kid tropes: a grieving mom fighting for the truth; police corruption; buried secrets; a powerful family controlling the town; rusting pickup trucks; mean dudes with mullets. But there is just about enough psychological complexity in the mix in the shape of the central character Charlie, a gay woman winded by the disappearance of her eight-year-old daughter Lily. Charlie marches about town stapling missing posters to lamp-posts in the midst of an emotional breakdown or maybe even a psychotic episode \u2013 hallucinating, seeing her daughter in dark corners.\nSet in Georgia in the 1990s, the film opens a year after Lily vanishes. Tough but vulnerable Charlie is played beautifully by character actor Robyn Lively (half-sister of Blake) with a riveting less-is-more stillness. The local sheriff (Stan Houston) is ignoring her. Her partner Angela (Bethany Anne Lind) has walked out; homophobia already put a strain on their relationship. When another local girl disappears, for reasons that remain foggy to me, Charlie is the prime suspect. The latest missing girl is the daughter of a whiskey heir Chip Carmichael (Michael Trucco) \u2013 he\u2019s a toxic mix of mommy\u2019s boy and tree-trunk-necked neanderthal.\nThe twists and turns of the case, familiar from a dozen past thrillers, are mostly easy to predict. Instead, the script depends on a big character reveal that just about works if you don\u2019t think about it too hard or too long. There\u2019s another outstanding performance too, from Shameless\u2019s Shanola Hampton, as ambitious young TV journalist Amy, who wheedles Charlie into partnering up with her. A black female reporter, Amy is also an outsider and the two women give the movie a satisfying emotional core, even if the storyline is a bit of a letdown. I also felt the denouement fetishised abuse, just a little.\n Disappearance at Lake Elrod is released on 1 November on digital platforms.",

        "content": "The costume designer Antoinette Messam explains how historical figures informed the looks of Regina King, Idris Elba and Lakeith Stanfield in the new western\nResearching outfits for the Netflix western The Harder They Fall, the costume designer Antoinette Messam got a history lesson in the process. The film\u2019s story is fictional, but it draws on the real-life black cowboys of the west, including Nat Love, Bill Pickett, Rufus Buck and characters such as Stagecoach Mary, who delivered mail across the US, protecting it from bandits with a shotgun. It is now thought that one in four cowboys were black, but this reality has been whitewashed from history.\n\u201cI literally had to buy this book, The Black West,\u201d says Messam. It contained images of these people for her to pore over. \u201cThey all had their own individual style,\u201d she says. \u201cSo, when it came to my cast, it was really, really important that I differentiate everyone so they\u2019re not a cookie-cutter, stereotypical cowboy, you know?\u201d\nDirected by Jeymes Samuel and produced by Jay-Z, the film features Regina King, Zazie Beetz, Idris Elba, Lakeith Stanfield, Delroy Lindo and Jonathan Majors. Their costumes showcase Messam\u2019s research skills. Love, played by Majors, wears jeans. Messam says the original appeal was the indigo colour, \u201cbut I when I started doing my research, I was shocked to know that denim as I show it existed far before my timeline, from the 1850s. I was like: \u2018My shit is accurate, you guys.\u2019\u201d\nStagecoach Mary, played by Beetz, is reimagined as a former gang member who owns saloons. She wears a corseted dress that multitasks. \u201cWhen we first see her, it\u2019s important to show her in the attire of a saloon,\u201d says Messam. \u201cThen, when we see her again, she\u2019s dressed to go out on the plains \u2026 her dress is split, so that she can straddle a horse, not sit side-saddle, which was common at the time.\u201d\nDetails like this are crucial for Messam. Most viewers will notice King\u2019s frilled blouse, Stanfield\u2019s neckerchief or Elba\u2019s red velvet jacket, but look closer and you will see the different cultural influences that people such as Love and Buck would have absorbed. \u201cIt was important for me to use references from all over the world,\u201d says Messam. \u201cSpanish references, Mexican references, indigenous references. Mary wears a lot of silver and turquoise, and they were influenced by the vaqueros, Mexican cowboys.\u201d\nCuffee, played by Danielle Deadwyler, is a gender-non-conforming character who provides the muscle on the door of Stagecoach Mary\u2019s saloon. \u201cIn doing my research and coming across a woman who dressed non-binary, as we would call it now, it looked to me like it was mostly for practical reasons,\u201d says Messam. Cuffee is clearly more comfortable in a man\u2019s suit than a skirt. \u201cTo be taken seriously, that\u2019s what worked for her,\u201d says Messam. \u201cIf she was going to knock somebody out, it was better that she was wearing pants and a jacket.\u201d\nWhile modern viewers might assume that the clothing in The Harder They Fall would conform to gender norms, Messam says the era was more varied in reality \u2013 especially in the wild west. This is evident in her costumes. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see some of them in the saloon, but there was a woman in hats and pants alongside the ladies of the night,\u201d she says.\nThe Harder They Fall comes out at a time when western style is enjoying a moment, with black Americans in the public eye showcasing the look. At the film\u2019s premiere, Taraji P Henson wore a stetson, while others donned cowboy boots. This follows Beyonc\u00e9 in chaps, Lil Nas X in a cowboy hat and the Yee-Haw Agenda, a website and Instagram account that works as an archive of imagery.\nIs this about rediscovering style heritage lost to history? \u201cWell, there\u2019s that \u2013 and there\u2019s also the fact that people are becoming aware of the cowboy culture that exists now,\u201d Messam says. She references Elba\u2019s film, Concrete Cowboy, which is based on a real-life black cowboy community in Philadelphia, and a community she visited in California. \u201cDoing this film, they brought in cowboys from across the country to ride the horses,\u201d she says. \u201cI got to know some of them. They\u2019re so cool.\u201d\nThe Harder They Fall is on Netflix from 3 November",

This will be backdated and we will be working with local authorities on how it can be claimed in due course.\u201d\nGeorgia Gould, the chair of London Councils, said: \u201cLondon boroughs have stepped up to provide emergency support for hundreds of Afghan families evacuated during the summer. Despite promises from the Home Office, councils are yet to receive any funding to cover the cost of clothing, medical supplies or the hiring of support staff to help evacuees with basic needs.\n\u201cWe are urgently seeking reassurance from government that boroughs will receive this funding and that it will be extended to British nationals who have so far been excluded from this offer, which is unacceptable.\u201d\nThe news comes after reports that the Home Office\u2019s debit cards, known as Aspen cards, failed to activate, leaving new arrivals from Afghanistan with no cash. The Refugee Council said it was making payments of \u00a37-8,000 a week in emergency cash to refugees.\nMany people airlifted to safety from Afghanistan this summer are still unclear about their immigration status and not everyone has been told for which resettlement scheme they qualify and whether they are eligible for family reunion.\nLondon Councils told the Guardian it had received 221 homelessness applications from Afghans who do not qualify for resettlement support when they leave the hotel accommodation they were placed in when they arrived.\nEnver Solomon, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, said: \u201cIt\u2019s alarming that families with large numbers of vulnerable children, many of whom are very traumatised, are having to live in hotels without the support they need and without any money of their own.\n\u201cIt\u2019s critical that every family is given the warm welcome the government has promised so that it becomes a reality rather than just an aspiration. Government needs to step up its efforts by creating across Whitehall taskforce to make this happen.\u201d\nA government spokesperson said: \u201cThe emergency evacuation of Afghanistan was the biggest and fastest in our country\u2019s recent history. It helped over 15,000 people, including those who served alongside our armed forces, to safety in the United Kingdom. The government is working at pace to secure permanent housing for families and we would urge all local authorities to do their upmost to help support these vulnerable people.\u201d",

The highway code should also be updated with instructions to drivers to create corridors to allow emergency services to reach the scene of incidents, according to the MPs.\nThe report did not go as far some campaigners in calling for smart motorways to be scrapped, after a number of motorists who had broken down in a live lane and been hit by other vehicles were killed. However, it said that Shapps\u2019 so-called \u201cstock take\u201d and 18-point plan last year would not go far enough in addressing the risks.\nMPs also questioned Shapps\u2019 decision to end by 2025 the use of \u201cdynamic\u201d all-lane running, where the hard shoulder is sometimes used as a live traffic lane. They suggested that with clear, consistent use such motorways would be preferable, as they could retain the hard shoulder in quieter times.\nThe committee chair, Huw Merriman, said as only 29 miles of all-lane running smart motorways had operated for over five years, it \u201cfeels too soon, and uncertain, to use this as an evidence base to remove the hard shoulder from swathes of our motorway network\u201d.\nHe said the focus on upgrading safety by ministers was welcome, \u201cbut we\u2019ve been here before. We\u2019re not convinced that reinstating the hard shoulder on existing schemes is the answer, but the DfT must pause the rollout and take stock.\u201d\nThe select committee in June 2016 called on the government to drop or pause the rollout of smart motorways, which have been seen as a comparatively cheap and easy way to increase capacity on the UK\u2019s major road networks. A report then concluded that the trade-off in safety was an \u201cunacceptable price to pay\u201d for all-lane running.\nMotoring organisations welcomed the latest report, which they said was pragmatic and endorsed their calls for measures to improve safety.\nLabour said it confirmed that ministers had wrongly pressed ahead in the face of overwhelming warning evidence. Jim McMahon, the shadow transport secretary, said: \u201cWe know smart motorways in their current form, coupled with inadequate safety systems, are not fit for purpose and are putting lives at risk. Reinstating the hard shoulder while full investigations are carried out need not be costly \u2026 the government must finally listen.\u201d\nA DfT spokesperson said: \u201cWe\u2019re pleased that the committee recognises that reinstating the hard shoulder on all all-lane running motorways could put more drivers and passengers at risk of death and serious injury and that we\u2019re right to focus on upgrading their safety, as the secretary of state committed to doing when he became transport secretary.\u201d\nWhile \u201cimprovements have not always been made as quickly as they could have been in the past\u201d, Shapps had committed \u00a3500m on upgrades and the faster rollout of stopped vehicle detection technology, they added.",

        "content": "Despite a stellar 2021, England captain will fly out this week knowing he must banish bad memories of past Australia tours\nAs anyone who has ever suffered from fear of flying knows, distraction is key. Anything to trick the brain into forgetting that you and it are hurtling through the ether in the cramped belly of a giant tin bird. Distraction. By any means possible.\nBooze might be the answer for some, the David Boon approach to air travel. Maybe you swear by that \u201cmake fists with your toes\u201d thing or try to take your mind off the turbulence and terrifying sounds by strapping some headphones on and endlessly repeating the frightened flyers\u2019 mantra about it being more likely you will perish after a chance encounter with a shark than through air travel. Or was it a vending machine?\nMore rational souls seek solace with thoughts of the destination, of exciting adventures in store. On the flip side, perhaps the relative sanctuary and safety of the aeroplane is far preferable to what awaits beyond the tarmac after touchdown.\nJoe Root probably isn\u2019t a twitchy flyer, \u201caerophobia\u201d being relatively incompatible with the globetrotting demands of an international cricketer. Nevertheless he could be forgiven for finding himself somewhere between the two states of mind when he boards the flight to Australia on Thursday.\nIf there is a twinge of despair in the departure lounge or a wave of panic amid the clouds it could be because the next few weeks might well define his legacy as a batter and as a captain.\nTo the bat first. Root has enjoyed a remarkable run of form in 2021. In 12 Test matches, beginning with Sri Lanka in January and India home and away since, he has swept, stroked, glanced, cut, driven, defended and dominated against searing pace and devilish spin. On Asian dustbowl and English green-top, under Chennai sun and Pennine cloud. Root has been an almost constant figure at the crease, runs flowing from his blade with surgeon-like precision; 1,455 of them at an average a tick over 66. His six centuries this calendar year include three double centuries, a 186 and a 180 not out. With the rest of England\u2019s top order quacking and creaking of late, Root\u2019s runs have been increasingly imperative.\nIf England are to get even the pinkiest of fingers around the urn during five Test matches in Australia on deathly-dull drop-in batter-friendly pitches, Root surely has to pick up where he left off and extend his purple patch up to Christmas and beyond.\nBut here\u2019s the rub. Root has never scored a century in Australia. In fact, as he cruises over the vast expanses on Friday, he will be unable to recall too many happy memories from his intended destination. Oz has been his bogey-land, he has an average of 38 in his nine Tests down under. While the lofty 30s might be a mere pipe dream for some of the top-order batters who have made the plane, that\u2019s a significant drop-off for Root whose career average after 109 Tests is north of 50. He has made no secret of his desperation to put this record straight.\nRoot has also pointed to the pain of being dropped for the 2014 Sydney Test after a quiet tour in which he occasionally looked cowed at the crease. To be fair, in that series the half-man-half-velociraptor Mitchell Johnson was ravaging his way through England\u2019s batting lineup repeatedly, making even the most seasoned players yearn for the departure lounge.\nThe memory of missing out in that game inspired Root to improve. \u201cCooky sat me down and said: \u2018It\u2019s a tough call but you are not going to play in this game.\u2019\u201d He opened up to fellow Sheffield Collegiate alumnus and England captain Michael Vaughan in 2015. \u201cI can\u2019t remember what I did for the next hour. I was gone. I was an empty vessel \u2026 but then I was absolutely spewing. I was so angry and gutted because I had not scored runs, not because I thought I deserved to play.\u201d\nFour years later, Sydney again, but a different type of spewing. A debilitating bout of viral gastroenteritis struck Root down. Now captain and with England battling to stay in the game \u2013 the urn long since relinquished \u2013 Root spent time hooked up to a drip at St Vincent\u2019s hospital up the road from the Sydney Cricket Ground. Although he briefly made it back to the ground and out into the middle, he was physically unable to continue. Forced to retire on 58 not out after nearly four hours of batting with a raging fever in temperatures topping 50 degrees. At the moment of defeat he was passed out on a bench in the dressing room. Jimmy Anderson had to stand in for his stricken captain to do the media postmortem.\nDespite this, when Root boards the plane to Queensland this week it might even be with a sigh of relief. At last, it is on. The prospect of Messrs Cummins, Hazelwood, Starc and Lyon \u2013 each in possession of their own fearful projectiles \u2013 lying in wait at the Gabba on 8 December \u2013 is far preferable to the uncertainty and speculation of the past few months.\nAt one stage there were rumblings that those with young families \u2013 Jos Buttler, Chris Woakes, potentially even Root himself \u2013 would in effect be left with little choice but to rule themselves out of the tour due to the stringent quarantine regulations in place.\nThe prospect of a cad\u2019s tour to Oz was briefly in the offing, a Sam Billings XI or suchlike. In the end, with the right assurances made and the pandemic in Australia headed finally in the right direction, not to mention millions of pounds worth of broadcasting money at stake, the 2021-22 Ashes were cleared for takeoff. Perhaps crucially, Root will also have Ben Stokes by his side. As last-minute upgrades go, that is surely one of the best.\nAs England Test captain, off the field is where you increasingly earn your paycheck while your legacy is still determined by events on it. Root has been a popular, thoughtful and honest captain at a time when the global game has been navigating decidedly soupy skies. His players like and respect him hugely, while he doesn\u2019t quite attract the fawning and enjoy the free rein of Eoin Morgan. On paper he is England\u2019s most successful in the Test format, in terms of number of wins, despite a tendency on occasion to tactical naivety, resulting in a few chastening losses.\nIf Root helms an Ashes victory overseas, a big if, then his legacy as a captain will begin to nudge towards his greatness as a batter.

But just as we know the sun always rises in the east, tides rise and fall on schedule, and plutonium isotopes decay at a certain rate, you know that there will be a feature film, maybe starring Jonathan Pryce or even Tom Jones, made out of this documentary about a senior Welsh male voice choir.\nWhen film-maker Dylan Williams gets a phone call from his widowed nonagenarian father Ed saying he\u2019s sold the family home and is making plans for his own funeral, the director knows it\u2019s time to go home to Rhyl and spend some time with dad. Via voiceover from Dylan and nippily snipped editing we\u2019re introduced to Ed\u2019s tranquil, weekly rituals, from the weekly sheet change and Tuesday\u2019s bacon sandwich, to practice with the C\u00f4r Meibion Trelawnyd, the Welsh-language all-male choir he\u2019s been singing with for decades. A splice of archive footage shows Ed and some of his friends in the prime of middle age, belting it out on TV back in the day when the choir competed in singing competitions.\nThese days, there\u2019s a lot less competing and more assembling to sing at the funerals of fallen choristers as their numbers dwindle. Musical director Ann Atkinson, a former opera singer herself, recognises that if the choir is to survive they need to recruit men with brown hair (as opposed to white or grey), and soon Ed and some of his friends, including Dylan\u2019s primary school teacher Merf Richards, are hitting the supermarkets to hand out fliers and drum up new recruits.\nIt\u2019s hard not to feel as if there\u2019s a bit of emotional arm-twisting going on here to get viewers moist with emotion over the film\u2019s deployment of adorable old geezers (one of whom even takes on wing walking to raise money), stirring music and the melancholy theme of inevitable death. Thankfully, Williams tamps down the sentimentality with a wry eye for comedy \u2013 for example when the choir sings in a shopping mall, all dressed as Santas \u2013 as well as a painterly eye for faces and locales. Structurally, the story is a bit all over the place, but when the script editor comes on board for the inevitable feature, they\u2019ll work out the three-act structure in the end.\n Men Who Sing is released on 5 November in cinemas and on Curzon Home Cinema.",

        "content": "The refugee camp became notorious in 2015, as 1 million people fled war and danger to come to Europe. Years after it was demolished, 2,000 migrants are still waiting there, at the centre of a political storm\nA small group of Ethiopian and Eritrean men stand shoeless and shivering in Calais. A few hours earlier, they almost drowned in the Channel, trying to cross to the UK. They got into difficulty when the motor on their boat failed. Their jeans are stiff and sodden with sand and seawater.\n\u201cWe called the French coastguard to rescue us but they told us to call the English coastguard,\u201d says one man. \u201cEventually, the French rescued us and brought us back to Calais.\n\u201cI studied political science at university in my country and I want to work and contribute in the UK. I do not know what I can do now. I can\u2019t go back and I can\u2019t go forward. There is a lot of racism in this situation. We need to find peace. If we have no peace we have no life.\u201d\nFive years ago this week, workers dressed in orange jumpsuits and white hard hats came with sledgehammers and diggers to demolish the refugee camp that had been dubbed \u201cthe Jungle\u201d by the migrants living there in this city on the northern French coast. The squalid 1.5 sq mile (3.9 sq km) area of scrubland had become a symbol of Europe\u2019s migration crisis after more than 1 million desperate people \u2013 many escaping the conflict in Syria \u2013 fled to Europe by sea during 2015, according to UNHCR data.\nMigrants and police at the \u2018Old Lidl\u2019 site in Calais. The police clear the site regularly, evicting anyone living there and seizing remaining belongings.\nToday, the Jungle has gone, but the migrants remain \u2013 a report from Human Rights Watch, using data from local charities, estimates there are still about 2,000 migrants \u201cin wooded areas, in and around disused warehouses, and under bridges in and around Calais\u201d, including about 300 unaccompanied children. Several hundred more are camped in a forest near Dunkirk.\nThe migrants waiting in these areas are at the centre of a political storm. In the UK, the home secretary\u2019s draconian nationality and borders bill, which includes plans to punish asylum seekers who cross the Channel in small boats with a jail sentence and a ban on receiving state funds, looms on the horizon. There is growing hostility to the migrants on the French side, too, with police in Calais daily evicting the threadbare camps that replaced the Jungle. Authorities have even installed large rocks and boulders at some of the regular distribution points to prevent aid vans parking. Brexit has slowed shipments of clothing and other essential items.\nOn a patch of bare ground known as \u201cOld Lidl\u201d \u2013 it was once the site of a Lidl store \u2013 dozens of young men, mostly Sudanese, gather to replenish their water supplies and charge their phones via large portable power banks.\nA man sits alone on the former site of the Jungle.\nThey laugh and joke, but they look tired, lines prematurely etched in some of their young faces \u2013 and all are underweight, baggy jeans flapping around their legs.\nOne of them leads us to a small area of woodland where a group of young men are sleeping in a clearing, surrounded by rubbish. One is dozing in an open cardboard box; another is lying on the ground with his legs covered in blankets. He says he is struggling to walk because he was beaten badly by the police.\n\u201cOur routine is the same every day and every night,\u201d says a third man. \u201cWe try and sleep a bit during the day if we can. Then we go to bed about 8pm. At midnight every night we wake up and try to cross the Channel. We try to find a boat we can cross in ourselves because we don\u2019t have the money to pay the smugglers. Usually we don\u2019t succeed. We hurry back here by 6am so we can hide our few belongings before the police come to evict us every morning. Then the same cycle starts again.\u201d\nThe migrants here \u2013 from Sudan, Eritrea, Kurdistan and more recently Vietnam (who are said to be accompanied by traffickers) are undeterred in their plans to seek safety in the UK. The number of asylum applications in Britain fell in 2020 to 29,456 (significantly lower than the 93,475 asylum applications made in France and the 121,955 in Germany). However, migrant small boat crossings from northern France to the UK are at record levels.\nThese Sudanese young men are gloomy about their chances of reaching the UK. One, who came here via Libya, shows us a photograph on his phone of a 16-year-old boy known as Yasser, also Sudanese, who died on 28 September trying to board a truck at Calais. He had hoped he could secretly reach the UK by clinging on to the vehicle.\n\u201cHe was my friend,\u201d says the young man showing the boy\u2019s photo. \u201cHe was so small. Like the rest of us, all he wanted was to live in a safe place. We call Priti Patel \u2018Madame No\u2019 because she won\u2019t allow us to do this.\u201d\nSeveral hundred migrants are camped in a forest near Dunkirk. The squalid conditions will only become worse in winter.\nThe French media has reported a second similar death of a young migrant trying to board a truck to the UK on 21 October. \u201cThe only thing in our lives now is to get across the Channel,\u201d the young man continues. \u201cMy hair has grown long. I have said I will not cut it until I reach the UK.\u201d\nThis desperation is just as palpable in neighbouring Dunkirk. The Grande-Synthe camp here is home to several hundred migrants, many of whom are Kurdish. They, too, have endured difficult journeys \u2013 some spent years stuck in camps in Greece.\nWhen we visit, the sun is shining and the autumn air is still warm in the forest area where the camp is based. The mud paths are dry now, but when the rain and snow come the area will be treacherous to navigate. Refugee barbers trim the hair of friends and family members, unofficial shopkeepers sell soft drinks on folding tables and Kurdish music blares. This group is more likely to have the money to pay smugglers, so tend to spend shorter periods of time here before crossing to the UK \u2013 some have enough money to buy a few essentials from the nearby supermarket.\nCharities including Care 4 Calais (top) and Refugee Info Bus (bottom) provide migrants with food, water, clothing and phone charging services. However, the funder Choose Love is due to stop financing at least seven local charities.\nNavid, a Kurd who speaks perfect English, was forced to flee Iran after he took part in protests against the government, an action which is punishable by death, and was called to appear in court. \u201cI studied mechanical engineering at one of the best universities in Iran,\u201d he says. \u201cI travelled through nine countries to get here; a lot of the time I was walking. The journey took months. I hope I can cross the Channel to the UK soon. We are refugees. We have no other way.\u201d\nOne woman from Eritrea sits in the mud with her five-month-old baby. Her two older children play nearby. Like many, she is fleeing more than one problem. She escaped Eritrea as a child with her family and grew up in Sudan, a country she eventually had to escape from, too, arriving in Germany where she sought sanctuary. She married a man there who became increasingly violent and threatening, forcing her to run once again, this time with three young children in tow. \u201cEverything is shit,\u201d she says. \u201cI have no other words to describe my situation.\u201d\nWhile anti-migrant groups and politicians crank up the pressure on Patel to take a tough line on those trying to reach the UK, human rights campaigners say the home secretary\u2019s plans to make Channel crossings \u201cunviable\u201d is simply putting more lives at risk \u2013 as desperate people have little other choice but to attempt to cross regardless.\nTwo migrants who spoke to the Guardian. The man on the right had tried to cross the Channel the night before.\nFor those migrants here who are still waiting to get across, their precarious situation is expected to deteriorate. Choose Love, a major funder, is due to stop financing at least seven local charities in Calais and Dunkirk that provide migrants with food, water, clothing, phone charging, materials for basic shelter and firewood for cooking and keeping warm. Choose Love is one of the most high-profile funders supporting refugees in northern France; Coldplay, Dua Lipa, Olivia Colman, Jude Law, Stella McCartney and others have raised funds for it.\nMeanwhile, the police evictions continue. According to the organisation Human Rights Observers, police conducted more than 950 routine eviction operations in Calais and at least 90 routine evictions in Grande-Synthe in 2020, seizing nearly 5,000 tents and tarps and hundreds of sleeping bags and blankets.\nWe watch one such morning eviction in Calais. Five police vans turn up, the migrants pick up their bedding and stand to the side, the cleaning trucks come to take away any remaining belongings, before the migrants return to the same place to bed down once more, waiting to attempt the Channel again. Today, the cleaning truck leaves empty. These migrants have no belongings left for them to take.\nWhile refugees are denied access to running water, electricity and a roof over their heads \u2013 typical war zone conditions \u2013 they are living just yards from French citizens who have access to all these things in their suburban homes.\nAnti-eviction protesters Ludovic Holbein, Ana\u00efs Vogel and Philippe Demeest\u00e8re in St Pierre church, Calais.\nThe disparity is not wasted on local human rights campaigners, who have embarked on a hunger strike, which they say they will not stop until the French authorities halt the evictions. \u201cWe tried to have discussions and protests in the street, but nothing changed. So we had to take radical action,\u201d says Ana\u00efs Vogel, one of the strikers from the Secours Catholique charity based in St Pierre church, Calais. \u201cWe want the evictions to stop. Everyone is human and everyone is equal.\u201d\nBack in Grande-Synthe, we meet Rashid, 45, a Kurdish man from Iraq. He has been in Dunkirk for only two days, but it has taken him several years to reach this camp. As an IT worker and security guard, he says he was asked to take part in state corruption, refused, and had to flee. He crossed from Turkey to Greece, where he was stuck for three years. \u201cFive times we tried to cross to Albania from Greece, but each time we were pushed back,\u201d he says. \u201cWe made it to Albania eventually and spent 50 hours walking through the mountains. We were so tired and wanted to stop, but we couldn\u2019t. Here, my clothes are wet because water comes into our tent, but my life is safe. In this country, I am not scared to sleep in the street.\u201d",

From a quadriplegic high-school basketball star to a mother with recurring cancers, the subjects experience remarkable recoveries thanks to this medical revolution. One of the most moving moments is when Ryan, the teenage athlete, returns home four months after his initial treatment and raises his hand to greet his loved ones at the airport, a progress that would have been unimaginable without the advent of stem cell therapy.\nWhile the treatment has proved extraordinarily successful in combating incurable diseases, the research remains controversial as it involves the use of human embryos, which is inevitably intertwined with the abortion debate hotly contested in US politics. Furthermore, pharmaceutical corporations are hostile to a medical technology that would significantly reduce the traditional reliance on medications. Indeed, in the case of cancer patients, as stem cells can multiply into healthy cells to repair damaged areas from within, the research aims to reach a point where chemotherapy would no longer be needed. Once banned by George W Bush, federal funding for stem cell studies has gradually increased, though it remains mostly awarded for non-embryonic research.\nThis documentary is an effective emotional appeal, though perhaps it could have begun to examine the scientific side of the research earlier than the halfway point of a two-hour film. Nevertheless, the closing image of a woman with corneal damage now able to enjoy indoor mountain climbing swells with the optimism that the research will be allowed to continue on its journey.\n Ending Disease is released on 5 November on digital platforms.",

        "content": "Brad Raffensperger urged by Trump in early January to \u2018find 11,780 votes\u2019 to overturn Joe Biden\u2019s victory in the state\nThe Georgia Republican responsible for running elections considered an infamous call in which Donald Trump told him to \u201cfind\u201d enough votes to overturn Joe Biden\u2019s victory in the state a \u201cthreat\u201d to his safety and that of his family.\nBiden\u2019s victory in Georgia was a narrow but vital part of his national win. No Democratic presidential candidate had taken the state since Bill Clinton in 1992.\nTrump called Brad Raffensperger, the Georgia secretary of state, nearly two months after election day, on Saturday 2 January. Telling him \u201cit\u2019s pretty clear we won\u201d, the then president said: \u201cI just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have [to get]\u201d to surpass Biden\u2019s total.\nRaffensperger, a conservative who supported Trump, resisted the president\u2019s demands. That prompted Trump to suggest the refusal to expose mass voter fraud in Georgia \u2013 on which Trump insisted but which did not exist, as in all other states \u2013 could be a \u201ccriminal offense\u201d.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a big risk to you,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThat\u2019s a big risk.\u201d\nIn Integrity Counts, a book published on Tuesday, Raffensperger writes: \u201cI felt then \u2013 and still believe today \u2013 that this was a threat. Others obviously thought so, too, because some of Trump\u2019s more radical followers have responded as if it was their duty to carry out this threat.\u201d\nRaffensperger details death threats texted to his wife, an encounter with men who may have been staking out his home, and being escorted out of the Georgia state capitol on 6 January as rightwing protesters entered.\nA recording of Trump\u2019s call was released to the Washington Post and became a key exhibit in Trump\u2019s second impeachment trial, for inciting the deadly attack on the US Capitol on 6 January, by supporters seeking to overturn the election.\nTrump was acquitted when only seven Republican senators could be persuaded to vote for his guilt. He remains free to run for president again and dominates the Republican party but his attempts to overturn his defeat in Georgia have contributed to his extensive legal jeopardy.\nThe Fulton county district attorney, Fani Willis, is investigating. Raffensperger told the Associated Press investigators \u201ctalked to some of our folks here. We sent all the documents and she can now buy the book online\u201d.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report",

        "content": "Israel\u2019s Karine Elharrar could not attend summit on Monday due to lack of accessibility\nAn Israeli government minister has received an apology from Boris Johnson and the organisers of Cop26 after she could not attend the summit on Monday due to a lack of wheelchair accessibility.\nKarine Elharrar, Israel\u2019s minister of energy and water resources, described how she was denied entry to the summit because as a wheelchair user she was unable to access the Glasgow venue, criticising the refusal to accommodate her as \u201coutrageous\u201d.\nElharrar, who has muscular dystrophy, waited for two hours outside after organisers refused to let her enter the compound in the vehicle in which she had arrived, she said.\nHer office said she was eventually offered a shuttle transport to the summit area, but the shuttle was not wheelchair-accessible, forcing her to return to her hotel in Edinburgh.\nShe wrote on Twitter: \u201cI came to Cop26 to meet with my counterparts around the world and promote a common struggle in the climate crisis. It is sad that the UN, which promotes accessibility for people with disabilities, in 2021, does not provide accessibility to its events.\u201d\nAn official in the Israeli prime minister Naftali Bennett\u2019s delegation said they had formally complained to organisers, the Times of Israel reported. Bennett reportedly said Elharrar\u2019s vehicle would arrive at the summit area on Tuesday as part of his official convoy, thus ensuring her entry.\nJohnson later apologised personally to Elharrar when she joined a meeting between him and Bennett, saying he was sorry for the \u201cconfusion\u201d. Bennett thanked his British counterpart for his \u201cquick intervention on this unfortunate incident\u201d and called it a \u201clearning opportunity for all of us in the importance of accessibility for all\u201d, a statement backed by Johnson.\nCop26 organisers tweeted: \u201cRegarding minister Elharrar\u2019s experience at the entry point yesterday, this was a genuine mistake and we have apologised for that. We are pleased to see her in attendance at Cop26 today. Cop26 must be inclusive and accessible to all and the venue is designed to facilitate that.\u201d\nElharrar told BBC News she had gone into the climate summit on Tuesday \u201cvery easily\u201d and it was \u201cquite a different experience\u201d.\nEarlier the UK environment secretary, George Eustice, said: \u201cWe deeply regret that incident.\u201d He added there appeared to have been a miscommunication and organisers had not been aware of Elharrar\u2019s requirements in advance and so had not made the right provisions at the particular entrance she was coming to.\n\u201cI know that at most of the other entrances, wheelchair access is there. It was because she came to an entrance where they didn\u2019t have that provision,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, adding that action should have been taken to resolve the issue.\nA spokesperson from the Israeli embassy in London told BBC News the country\u2019s delegation to the summit had \u201ccommunicated over the past several weeks all the details about the minister\u2019s requirements\u201d.\nThe UK ambassador to Israel, Neil Wigan, tweeted that he had apologised \u201cdeeply and sincerely\u201d to the minister. \u201cWe want a Cop summit that is welcoming and inclusive to everyone,\u201d he wrote.\nThe Foreign Office minister James Cleverly tweeted: \u201cI am deeply disappointed and frustrated that minister @KElharrar could not access Cop today. The Cop venue is designed to be accessible for all. I have spoken to the minister about this and I look forward to meeting her tomorrow.\u201d\nElharrar told Israel\u2019s Channel 12 news: \u201cThe only way they said I could come in was to walk on foot for almost a kilometre, or to board a shuttle which was not wheelchair-accessible.\u201d\nShe told Ynetnews.com that organisers blocked all roads leading to the conference and left her out despite the Israeli delegation\u2019s best efforts to convince security to let her in.\n\u201cIt was impossible to get in with a car and I could not make that distance independently,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s outrageous conduct and it should not have happened. I came for certain purposes and could not achieve them today, but there will be other opportunities.\n\u201cThe UN calls on everyone to act in accordance with the international convention and to make places accessible, so it is fitting that its events should be accessible. I sincerely hope that today\u2019s lesson will be learned so that tomorrow promoting green energies, removing barriers and energy efficiency will be the only things I have to deal with.\u201d",

It has been designed by the artist Simon Hitchens and is intended as a tribute to the Queen in her platinum jubilee year. Made from steel, the work is meant to look like a thin slice of the hillside, which has been cut north to south through the bedrock and then tilted and elevated.\nMary Ann Rogers, a local artist and gallery owner, said she thought it looked outdated, like something from behind the iron curtain.\nShe is a co-founder of the campaign group Keep the Wannies Wild, which, with 2,000 supporters, has been fighting the plan. \u201cI am absolutely devastated,\u201d she said. \u201cI live only a couple of miles away from the site and it is a really special place. It\u2019s somewhere I go to walk and be quiet and listen to the birds so I am absolutely gutted that they are going to do something so mad there.\u201d\nRogers said she was a fan of public art but there was no good reason for the sculpture. Nor was it appealing. \u201cTo me it is strident, it\u2019s triumphant and it is vast. It looks more like a scimitar or a knife or a sword.\u201d\nIt was, she said, \u201cecological vandalism\u201d and there was \u201cmonumental irony\u201d that the decision was being announced during the Cop26 summit.\nThe landowner and driving force behind Ascendant is the 3rd Viscount Devonport, Terence Kearley, who has been adamant that the development will have a minimal effect on the natural environment.\nHe was, he said, delighted by the decision. \u201cIt is our ambition to create a sculpture that is not only celebratory of Queen Elizabeth II and the Commonwealth, but which is also a magnificent piece of artwork that acts as a beacon for visitors and tourists to the region \u2013 benefiting the local rural economy and businesses.\u201d\nThe task now is to raise the estimated \u00a32-3m for the project, with campaigners conceding the battle is lost.\nHitchens said his sculpture\u2019s design \u201cacknowledges the past, respects the present and aspires for a better future.\n\u201cI believe the landmark will be a valuable asset to local communities and the north-east of England, as a cultural destination with a global reputation.\u201d",

        "content": "Analysis: first minister can steer clear of any policy failures while pointing to benefits independence could bring\nAs world leaders, negotiators and activists converged on Glasgow for the start of the Cop climate summit, curious delegates who picked up a Scottish newspaper may have seen a small advert from the Scottish National party.\nIts main image was of Skye\u2019s famous crags bathed by sunshine, with a soft-focus portrait of the first minister, and it read: \u201cA nation in waiting welcomes the nations of the world.\u201d\nDespite the simplicity of that proposition, public enthusiasm for independence has fallen since it reached a record high of 59% at the peak of the pandemic in October last year. Most opinion polls over the past six months have shown the yes vote trailing no by between four and eight points.\nWas that message misplaced? Her pro-UK opponents have accused Sturgeon of pursuing a \u201cdivisive obsession\u201d as the rest of the world focused on a collective effort to combat a global crisis \u2013 a charge she denies.\nHardliners inside the independence movement fear Sturgeon has lost her spark, fatigued by the long hours she invested managing the Covid crisis, the impacts of Brexit and the Alex Salmond crisis, and running her government. Last week she broached the issue of life after politics, disclosing to Vogue magazine she may foster children in the future.\nSome internal critics, bolstered by their allies in Salmond\u2019s small breakaway party Alba, are openly challenging Sturgeon on the timing of a referendum, and question her appetite for staging one.\nAngus MacNeil, a dissident SNP MP who chairs the Commons trade committee, implied in a newspaper column last week that Sturgeon knew Boris Johnson would never agree to a referendum and that the supreme court would block any attempt by her to stage one without his approval. She had to find another route to secure independence, he argued.\nYet there are few concrete signs Sturgeon is as ambivalent as her critics allege. When she set out her programme for government in September, she said civil servants had been told to start drafting a new case for independence. Conscious, too, of the public mood, Sturgeon insists that combating Covid takes immediate precedence over pushing for a fresh independence vote. And her strategists have their eyes on other factors, the Cop climate talks among them.\nWhat Cop may do is nudge cautious Scottish voters into taking a more green- and climate-minded worldview. If so, that could work to Sturgeon\u2019s long-term advantage and that of the wider independence movement.\nHer SNP government is sharing power for the first time in 14 years with the pro-independence Scottish Greens. For the first time since devolution in 1999, there are Green ministers at Holyrood and their agreement includes staging an independence vote before the next Scottish election.\nGlasgow\u2019s designation as host city \u2013 perhaps chosen by Conservative ministers in London to show the UK embracing Scotland \u2013 directly influenced Sturgeon\u2019s decision to sign the deal with the Greens. It was a political decision, and not based on numerical advantage at Holyrood: she has aligned the SNP with a more leftwing party to amplify her government\u2019s pro-climate claims, at a time when green politics, thanks to Cop, is ascendant.\nWhile Sturgeon does not have a seat at the negotiating table \u2013 no devolved administrations do at Cop \u2013 she is enjoying a significant profile at the conference locally, welcoming Greta Thunberg and the Minga Ind\u00edgena collective, and campaigning for the voices of women and girls to be advanced in the talks.\nShe is sufficiently distant from any policy failures at Cop not to be tainted by them, while able to point to the differences she says independence would bring.\nThat strategy is likely to emerge clearly later in November, when the SNP is to hold a short party conference at which Sturgeon is expected to prioritise the drive for a second independence vote. Any policy failures at Cop and her government\u2019s heavier emphasis on the climate and environment will feature heavily.\nIf Cop helps shift the Scottish electorate\u2019s mood, and finally makes voters amenable to the tougher changes to their energy use, and driving, shopping and holiday habits that cutting CO2 emissions involves, Sturgeon has gambled that the SNP and the case for independence will gain.",

The show, originally staged in 2019, has been rewritten to include developments from the intervening years, during which Doyle has become a regular on GB News. The show takes aim at predictable targets: Greta Thunberg, trans athletes, Meghan Markle and Nish Kumar.\nTonight, we\u2019re part of an educational seminar. \u201cIf you\u2019re unsure which opinions to have, this is the workshop for you,\u201d McGrath tells us.\nDoyle says he created the character as a way to challenge the erosion of free speech and the degradation of political debate. There are deep wells of potential material \u2013 the censorious Twitter culture found on both left and right, the tendencies to wilfully misread social media posts and double-down rather than admit mistakes. McGrath only skims the surface. Doyle himself performing standup as the support act engages with his chosen topics more successfully and provides bigger laughs.\nBarely a minute into McGrath\u2019s section, the show attempts to provoke with a \u201cjoke\u201d using outdated ableist terms. Is the punchline McGrath\u2019s faux pas or are we supposed to find the idea that you\u2019d avoid these phrases amusing? What are we laughing at? It\u2019s a question raised again when a photograph of a trans athlete is presented as a punchline, and when we\u2019re invited to mock McGrath\u2019s defence of Shamima Begum.\nIt\u2019s not always clear whom the character is parodying \u2013 does a wealthy slam poet dressed in Zara-style office-wear conjure the grains of truth that make great satire? The recurring joke is that she\u2019s a hypocrite (a supporting character even spells this out in case we missed the message), but it quickly feels repetitive.\nSome jokes \u2013 on remainers patronising working-class people and the tweeness of anti-Trump protests \u2013 do land. But many do exactly what the show accuses online activists of, reducing complex topics to nuance-free quips. There\u2019s a surprising number of Hitler jokes too, Godwin\u2019s law IRL. In these ways, it does bring Twitter to the West End.\nI hesitate to give this one star. A show that skewers the terminally offended will no doubt wear it as a recommendation. And yet, here we are. Don\u2019t mistake this for courting controversy, it simply isn\u2019t very funny.",

What\u2019s behind it and which products are worst affected?\nAustralians trying to order goods could face a nightmare before Christmas, as shortages caused by blockages in global supply chains continue to bite.\nThe pandemic has stretched supply chains to breaking point, which may make some goods scarce until 2023.\nShoppers are still complaining of empty shelves, long after the toilet paper buying frenzies and personal protective equipment shortages of 2020. There are shortfalls of goods from medicines to coffee, to electronics and bicycles and clothes. Dan Murphy\u2019s has said some alcohol products will be hard to source, and Australia Post has warned presents may not make it in time to go under the Christmas tree.\nThere is no single reason for the shortages, but rather a combination of factors arising from the global disruption caused by the pandemic and local obstacles such as state border closures and industrial disputes on the wharves.\nThe chief economist at the Committee for Economic Development of Australia, Jarrod Ball, says there was a \u201cmassive shift of consumption\u201d into goods over services during Australia\u2019s lockdowns, as governments pumped out wage and benefit subsidies and restrictions prevented spending on travel and hospitality.\nBut as demand for goods grew, the problems with supply got steadily worse.\nThe chief executive of the Australian Retailers Association, Paul Zahra, says that has caused a nightmare for his members.\n\u201cOur supply chains are under incredible pressure at the moment and there\u2019s a myriad of issues at play here that are creating the perfect storm for retailers and consumers.\u201d\nMost of Australia\u2019s imports come from China, followed by the US.\nAs an island, Australia is particularly vulnerable to shipping delays, all the more so when the number of flights arriving in the country has been drastically curtailed.\n\u201cAt a global level, retailers are reporting that the capping of incoming flights has put significant pressure on shipping, and we are seeing container costs escalating up to four times their usual rate,\u201d Zahra says.\nThe price of shipping containers has exploded, as has the cost of chartering a ship to move things around the world, as the domestic spending boom on consumer goods in the US and the general disruption to pre-pandemic flows of containers has caused logjams of container ships in US ports, and shortages elsewhere.\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nWhen containers do arrive, they face more delays at Australia\u2019s ports. The Maritime Union of Australia is locked in a battle over pay and conditions, with rolling strikes set to continue this month.\nPallets, the wooden containers used to transport many items, are also suddenly undergoing a mismatch of supply and demand.\n\u201cThe pallets are a really good example of all these factors coming together in a way people might not have foreseen,\u201d Ball says.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got a massive spike for consumer goods but at the same time a big lift in demand for timber due to lots of building and the renovations that are going on.\n\u201cAdd to that disruption to the factories that make the pallets, and that all adds up to a pallet shortage.\u201d\n \nEmail:\u00a0sign up for our\u00a0daily morning and afternoon email newsletters\nApp:\u00a0download our free app\u00a0and never miss the biggest stories\nSocial:\u00a0follow us on YouTube,\u00a0TikTok,\u00a0Instagram,\u00a0Facebook\u00a0or\u00a0Twitter\nPodcast:\u00a0listen to our daily episodes on\u00a0Apple Podcasts,\u00a0Spotify\u00a0or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app\nCovid itself continues to have a direct effect on crucial links in the chain. Distribution centres have been shut down, or staff forced to isolate, slowing the flow of goods. Australia Post has been overwhelmed at times during lockdown restrictions, and courier companies are also feeling the strain.\n\u201cSome distribution centres and warehouses have been impacted by reduced staffing levels due to Covid cases, we\u2019ve had industrial disputes from delivery drivers and port workers, while state border controls and limited domestic flights are also impacting the movement of goods,\u201d Zahra says.\nFinally, there is a shortage of the right people for the right jobs. Infrastructure Australia warned in October that two in three key occupations necessary for construction were \u201clikely or potentially in shortage\u201d. There are nationwide shortages of engineers and architects, and potential shortages of bricklayers, concreters, carpenters, electricians and other tradies.\nCars and electronics\nThe pandemic has increased demand as people buy more computer products to work from home or entertain themselves in lockdowns.\nBut the global dearth of semiconductors used in electronics such as whitegoods, phones and cars means even Apple has struggled to get chips for iPhones, Macs and iPads. All computer manufacturers are facing similar difficulties.\nToyota Australia says current demand exceeds supply, with long delays for parts. People are waiting months for some of its most popular models. Nissan, General Motors and Volkswagen are all facing delays.\nFood and groceries\nThe Australian Food and Grocery Council has pulled together a taskforce to deal with supply problems, including the pallet crisis, which is hampering supermarkets shifting goods around the country. The council\u2019s chief executive, Tanya Barden, says Covid staff shortages and shutdowns mean products have been kept in storage on pallets for longer.\n\u201cThe issues include impacts on global shipping and sector shutdowns based on health authority orders,\u201d she says. She hopes that as states open up, pallets will be emptied and put back into distribution.\n\u201cNew measures for management of Covid close contacts in the workplace should also have beneficial flow-on effects to address pressures on labour capacity issues in supply chains.\u201d\nSpecific issues have further complicated the picture for other products, including coffee and some alcohol brands.\nBuilding materials\nEven before Covid, Australia was facing timber shortages because of the 2019-20 bushfires, which burned commercial plantations as well as native forests.\nDemand for construction materials skyrocketed during the pandemic as the federal government poured stimulus money into construction. That happened globally, too, so imports couldn\u2019t make up the shortfall.\nSteel and other construction supplies are also in short supply. Steel mills around the world wound back production when Covid hit, expecting things would slow down, the Australian Steel Association chief, David Buchanan, has said. But then the stimulus money did what it was intended to do, and demand soared.\nThe Australian Institute of Architects has warned that insulation, bricks and plaster board could also face shortages.\nIn July, the Productivity Commission warned that increasingly complex global supply chains meant they were more at risk from trade wars, natural disasters, financial crises, pandemics and infrastructure-related failures such as cyberattacks.\nBall says the consensus is the shortages will not end anytime soon.\n\u201cIt won\u2019t really be until 2023 that we start to see some moderation in this,\u201d he says, warning that even then there is a risk of worker shortages in service industries.\nZahra says the only thing consumers can do is try to plan ahead wherever possible.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the season to shop early,\u201d he says.",

        "content": "Joe Root fancies the shellacking England\u2019s Twenty20 side handed out to Australia last Saturday has increased confidence before the Ashes campaign, even if the personnel, format and conditions will differ from the World Cup in the United Arab Emirates.\nEngland\u2019s tour of Australia officially gets under way on Thursday when a squad of 13 red-ball specialists \u2013 including the recently added Ben Stokes \u2013 and 15 Lions players fly to Queensland to begin preparations for the five-match series that starts at the Gabba on 8 December.\nOf the five players set to join them after the World Cup \u2013 the final of which is on 14 November \u2013 four played in the eight-wicket group stage win against Australia, although only Jos Buttler and Dawid Malan appear certain starters in the Test side. Jonny Bairstow and Chris Woakes will push for spots, while Mark Wood, yet to feature in the UAE because of an ankle injury, will have to prove his fitness.\nNevertheless, along with the significance of India winning in Australia this year, Root sees some relevance from a short-form victory over a team that included five Test regulars in David Warner, Steve Smith, Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Starc.\n\u201cIndia proved to the rest of the world that Australia is not a place you can\u2019t go and win,\u201d Root said. \u201cThey took them on in their own way, they played to their strengths, but they didn\u2019t take a backward step at any stage. It\u2019s making sure we do the work now and we give ourselves that confidence.\n\u201cAnd also probably try and lean on that confidence and performance the T20 side put in the other night. There will be guys from both teams involved in that series and you want to try and capture as much confidence as you can.\u201d\nThe start of the Ashes tour will be like no other before it. England\u2019s players and a backroom staff initially led by Graham Thorpe are expected to touch down in Brisbane and then travel to a resort on the Gold Coast for a two-week quarantine period where they will spend the first three days isolating in hotel rooms.\nThe enlarged squad will then be allowed time outside and begin training at the multipurpose Metricon Stadium in Carrara; once the fortnight is complete, further freedoms in line with local restrictions will follow, even if the focus will be on the two intra-squad matches that serve as their only warm-up cricket.\nA bubble of sorts will still be in place and mindful of the need to establish protocols on the ground and avoid any breaches, the England and Wales Cricket Board is understood to be flying out Steve Elworthy for the first month of the tour in what represents a final outing for the director of events before he takes up his new role as Surrey\u2019s chief executive.\nElworthy masterminded the ECB\u2019s behind-closed-doors summer of 2020 and the bubbles that prevented any Covid-19 cases; as Root stressed on Tuesday after a training session at Loughborough, it is imperative the players remain respectful of the rules, even if bubble life is grating after 18 months.\nOn England\u2019s own experience of facing India during the summer, a series they finished 2-1 down but will not be decided until the rescheduled fifth Test next year, Root said: \u201cThere were a couple of occasions when games could have gone either way and India just grabbed it ahead of us.\n\u201cWe have to have the bit between our teeth and stand up at those key moments and say: \u2018Right, we are going grab this game,\u2019 and make sure that we are the ones in that tight moment who get across the line and get the win. It\u2019s a great lesson for us all.\n\u201cI\u2019m very wary about commenting too much on Australia, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the right approach for us. It\u2019s never really been something that we\u2019ve paid too much attention to.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll do our research and make sure we\u2019re very well prepared for what Australia are likely to throw at us, but ultimately we need to make sure our own house is in order, that we\u2019re as ready as we can be.\u201d",

Henderson, however, insists that fiercely competitive edge benefited him and Liverpool during Su\u00e1rez\u2019s three and a half years with the club and the Uruguay international\u2019s contribution should be recognised on Wednesday.\n\u201cWe all know he\u2019s a top player, has been for a long time, who produced so many good moments at Liverpool,\u201d the midfielder said. \u201cI learned a lot from him while he was here. I\u2019m quite close to him and still speak to him. Now and again I\u2019ll call him to see how he is doing, how his family is doing and things like that.\n\u201cI took a lot from him. He helped us a lot when he was at Liverpool with the mentality side of things \u2013 how he was in training, how he always wanted to win and how he played through pain barriers. He just wanted to get out and play football and try his best for the team. He helped me massively and made me grow in confidence as a player. I had a good relationship with him on the pitch but also off the pitch as well.\u201d\nThe Liverpool captain believes any appreciation for Su\u00e1rez from the crowd should be reserved until after the game, although the 34-year-old may not be overly concerned by his reception. \u201cWhen Luis was here he was phenomenal for a number of years; he was outstanding,\u201d Henderson said. \u201cThe fans know that and will appreciate what he did at this football club. I don\u2019t think Luis will be too bothered [at the reception]. Maybe not during the game, but it would be nice after the game for him to get a nice reception from the crowd.\u201d\nLiverpool were drawn in a Champions League group full of European pedigree but J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s team can qualify with two matches to spare with another victory.

        "content": "PM urges citizens to arm themselves as US clears way for further economic sanctions\nEthiopia has declared a state of emergency after forces from the northern region of Tigray said they were gaining territory and considering marching on the capital Addis Ababa.\nThe declaration came as Joe Biden accused the government of \u201cgross violations of internationally recognised human rights\u201d and said he that he was removing Ethiopia from a key US trade program, clearing the way for further economic sanctions over its failure to end the nearly year-long conflict.\nJeffrey Feltman, the US special envoy for the Horn of Africa, warned that the US would take further measures against the Abiy government within days rather than weeks if it does not end the conflict.\nHe said \u201cWe can proceed down one path that inevitably leads to sanctions and other measures or we can go down another path where we can revitalise the partnership that started when prime minister [Abiy Ahmed] took office. The US wants the latter.\u201d\n\u201cProlonging the war, dodging genuine negotiations to lead to de-escalation and a ceasefire, and refusing unhindered humanitarian access to avert catastrophe are actions that are taking Ethiopia [in] a dangerous direction,\u201d he said.\nThe announcement of the state of emergency came two days after the prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, urged citizens to take up arms to defend themselves from the Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front (TPLF).\nEarlier on Tuesday, authorities in Addis Ababa told residents to register their arms and prepare to defend their neighbourhoods.\nThe state of emergency was imposed after the TPLF claimed to have captured several towns in recent days and said it was considering marching on Addis Ababa, about 380km (235 miles) to the south of their forward positions.\nThe city administration said people should register their weapons and gather in their neighbourhoods. House-to-house searches were being conducted and troublemakers arrested, a statement said.\n\u201cResidents can gather in their locality and safeguard their surroundings,\u201d it said. \u201cThose who have weapons but can\u2019t take part in safeguarding their surroundings are advised to hand over the weapon to the government or their close relatives or friends.\u201d\nThe governments of four of the country\u2019s 10 regions also called upon Ethiopians to mobilise to fight against the Tigrayan forces, state-affiliated Fana TV said.\nOn Monday night, Tigrayan forces said they had linked up with fighters from an Oromo force also fighting the central government. The Oromo are Ethiopia\u2019s biggest ethnic group. Many of their political leaders are currently in prison.\nThe conflict in what was once considered a stable western ally in a volatile region has plunged about 400,000 people in Tigray into famine, killed thousands of civilians and forced more than 2.5 million people in the north to flee their homes.\nSpeaking in Washington, Feltman said the US was seeing signs of famine and near-famine and that it was mostly government restrictions that were preventing humanitarian help from getting to people.\nHe said: \u201cIt is not too late to retrace our steps towards the path not taken but the change in direction must occur in days not weeks. It requires the Ethiopian government to take steps we have been raising for months\u2019\u2019.\nHe said he was willing to travel at any time to the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa to mediate and secure a peace deal with the TPLF.\nFeltman said there were \u201ccredible and repeated stories of looting, displacement, executions, reports of rape and sexual violence as a tool of war\u201d in which all factions were implicated to some degree.\nHe said that the US will be encouraging \u201cinternational justice and accountability against those responsible for the horrors they have imposed on the Ethiopian people\u201d.\nHe added \u201cthe Ethiopian people who have suffered are going to want to see some kind of justice and reckoning for the horrors they have been through due to this needless conflict.\u201d\nThe conflict started over the night of 3 November 2020, when forces loyal to the TPLF \u2013 including some soldiers \u2013 seized military bases in Tigray, a northern region. In response, Abiy sent more troops there.\nThe TPLF had dominated national politics for nearly three decades but lost much influence when Abiy took office in 2018 after years of anti-government protests.\nWhen he first came to power, Abiy enacted significant political reforms but rights groups say many of those freedoms have since been rolled back.\nHe was awarded the Nobel peace prize in 2019 for ending a long-running border conflict with Eritrea. Troops from Eritrea, whose president is an arch-enemy of the TPLF, later entered Tigray to support Ethiopian forces.",

It added that face-to-face meetings should be avoided as much as possible.\nAlthough the contingency measures to guard against further infections in parliament have been activated, the law as it applies to England remains that there is no requirement for people to follow social distancing or wear masks.\nWhile people have been advised to wear face coverings in crowded rooms for months, cabinet ministers and most Tory MPs continued to sit shoulder-to-shoulder in the Commons chamber maskless. That changed last week, when the prime minister, Boris Johnson, and other Conservatives wore a face covering during the budget, though three did not \u2013 including the Commons leader, Jacob Rees-Mogg.\nThe Labour MP Ben Bradshaw hit out at those MPs continuing not to wear a mask.

China, India and Russia have not joined the pact known as the Global Methane Pledge.\nThe pledge was first announced in September but Biden\u2019s officials have since been working hard to increase the number of signatories and the momentum behind the pledge. The detailed US proposals may prove to be one of the lasting successes of the Cop26 climate conference being held in Glasgow.\nMany of the regulatory measures do not require Congressional approval, and so give Biden some short-term effective measures to which he can point. The oil and gas industry is reckoned to be responsible for 30% of methane emissions in the US.\nA new Environment Protection Agency rule that regulates leak detection and repair in the oil industry repealed by Donald Trump will be restored and for the first time applied to new operations in gas, including regulation of natural gas produced as a by-product of oil production that is vented or flared.\nThe Biden team hopes that 75% of all methane emissions will be covered.\nThe other major sources of methane in the US are municipal landfills, thousands of abandoned oil wells and coal mines, and finally agriculture.\nNew rules, due to be phased in, will require companies to oversee and inspect 3m miles (4.8m km) of pipelines, including 300,000 miles (480,000km) of transmission lines and 2.3m miles (3.7m km) of lines inside cities. In Boston alone it is estimated that 49,000 tonnes of methane leak each year.\nThe administration says it is working in concert with the EU and is using a mix of incentives, new disclosure rules and regulation.

Lewes received funding for local seafood industries and will also benefit from an East Sussex bid for a new road bridge in Seaford.\nA number of areas of high deprivation received large awards, including Burnley and Stoke-on-Trent, which got \u00a319.9m and \u00a356m respectively.\nAlex Cunningham, the Labour MP for Stockton North, which includes an area that missed out on funding, said: \u201cThe Tories like to talk a good game on levelling up, but this is yet more proof that it is an empty slogan and that pork barrel politics is the name of the game.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s high time that the prime minister, chancellor and levelling-up secretary come clean and explain to the people of Billingham, and other areas that have significant levels of deprivation but missed out on much needed funding, why they feel places like Yarm and Eaglescliffe in the Tees Valley, and Bromsgrove and Central Bedfordshire further afield, are more deserving of the levelling-up cash than they are.\u201d\nThe government\u2019s levelling-up fund is designed to combat regional inequality by investing in infrastructure that \u201cbrings pride to a local area\u201d, according to the scheme\u2019s prospectus.\nJust under half of the 65 English local authorities that will benefit from funding announced in last week\u2019s budget are among the country\u2019s most deprived fifth. However, Bromsgrove, Central Bedfordshire and the Isles of Scilly \u2013 which is to receive funding for a ferry service \u2013 are among the country\u2019s least deprived.\nAlthough more Labour councils than Conservative-controlled ones received funding in this first tranche, Tory councils did better per capita at \u00a393 per head of population compared with \u00a365 per head for Labour councils. Councils with no overall control received \u00a3102 per head while the two Liberal Democrat areas announced thus far, Eastbourne and Hinckley and Bosworth, are in line to receive \u00a3183 per capita.\nWhere funding was originally allocated to a county council or city region, the Guardian analysis split the funding across the lower-tier councils that will benefit from a scheme.\nThe announced funding is part of the Conservative party\u2019s broader \u201clevelling-up agenda\u201d. Other announcements have already been made under the towns fund and the future high streets fund while a further pot, the \u00a3220m community renewal fund, is yet to be announced.\nThe first tranche of the \u00a34.8bn levelling-up fund announced last week included cultural regeneration funding for Liverpool\u2019s waterfront and the reopening of the Whorlton Bridge over the River Tees.\nA spokesperson for the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said: \u201cThis analysis is nonsense. The selection process for the levelling-up fund is transparent, robust and fair, and we publish the criteria on gov.uk.\n\u201cThe first round of funding will help to ensure opportunity is spread more equally across the UK by empowering local leaders, improving public services and restoring pride in place.\u201d\nThis article was amended on 2 November 2021. A Beatles-inspired attraction in Liverpool will not be funded by the levelling-up fund as an earlier version stated.",

She alleged he once held a gun to her head, and sent her a WhatsApp message showing a gun on his sofa in which he threatened to \u201cdo her in\u201d.\nShe also said that after they broke up in January 2019, he sent \u201cintimate\u201d videos of her to friends and had received a number of greetings cards from Smith containing threats, one of which was a sympathy card with her photo on it saying: \u201cRIP, you\u2019re always in our thoughts \u2013 not.\u201d\nFollowing her complaints, police secured a warrant to arrest Smith and search his property for the firearm. A black imitation firearm was discovered at the property.\nSummarising the circumstances of Smith\u2019s death, the senior coroner Louise Hunt said that during the execution of the warrant, Smith remained in his bedroom where he sat on the end of the bed with a duvet held in front of him and one of his arms was not visible.\nA police dog was brought on the scene and started barking. Smith dropped the duvet and one of his limbs moved, and one of the police officers fired a weapon, with the bullet ricocheting off the bed frame and hitting Smith.\nSmith received CPR and an ambulance attended the property, but he was pronounced dead shortly afterwards. A postmortem confirmed he died from a single gunshot wound to the chest.\nSmith\u2019s family described him as \u201ca very bright, talented and creative individual\u201d, a well-dressed \u201cfashionista\u201d and an avid football fan who was popular across Birmingham. \u201cTrevor\u2019s life mattered and he did not deserve to lose it in this way,\u201d his sister Lorna Webley said.\n\u201cOne Friday morning, someone took my brother\u2019s life in three seconds. At this moment, we cannot explain the proper reason for any good cause for his death.\u201d\nShe said Smith, a father of two, had \u201cbattled with mental health challenges for many years, often dismissed by others as bad behaviour\u201d and that he was deeply affected by his father\u2019s death in 2017. In the months before his death his mother noticed Smith seemed depressed and his usual smart dress had become unkempt.\nThe inquest heard that in January 2019, Smith had overdosed in an attempt to take his own life and left three suicide notes, after which he was referred to Birmingham and Solihull mental health NHS foundation trust.\nHunt said that over the course of the inquest, jurors would also hear about an \u201cissue\u201d with the defibrillator used during resuscitation attempts and \u201cwhether there was any delay in an ambulance attending because there was a mix-up in the address\u201d.\nThe inquest, being held at Edgbaston cricket ground because of the Covid pandemic, continues.",

        "content": "Ofgem says latest collapses will leave about 24,000 households in need of a new supplier\n\n\nAnother four energy suppliers have gone bust in a single day as historic gas market highs continue to rip through the UK\u2019s energy market amid fresh fears that Russia may curb gas supplies to Europe.\nThe energy regulator, Ofgem, said the collapse of four small energy suppliers on Tuesday would leave about 24,000 households in need of a new supplier, and bring the total number of bust energy companies to 17 since the start of September, affecting more than 2 million households.\nThe flurry of failures follows rocketing global energy market prices due to a sudden surge in demand for gas as economies began to shrug off restrictions related to the Covid-19 pandemic. Gas markets have reached record highs in recent weeks, leading to one of the sharpest increases in home energy bills and fears of a cost-of-living crisis this winter.\nOut of the four UK casualties Zebra Power had the largest customer base, and supplied 14,800 households with energy. Omni Energy supplied about 6,000 domestic pre-payment customers, while AmpowerUK had about 600 UK customers and supplied a further 2,000 overseas households. MA Energy had about 300 overseas customers.\nScores more energy suppliers are expected to collapse in the months ahead as gas markets remain at near-record highs, and suppliers are forced to shoulder the higher costs without raising their tariffs above the regulator\u2019s energy price cap.\nConsumer charity Citizens Advice said struggling households would ultimately pay the price \u201cwith uncertainty, inconvenience and ultimately higher bills\u201d as suppliers continue \u201cto fall like dominoes\u201d.\nGillian Cooper, the head of energy at Citizens Advice, said: \u201cLast week, Ofgem set out how it intends to \u2018raise the bar\u2019 for supplier standards and improve their resilience in the short term. This is a positive step, but it\u2019s clear that existing rules and their enforcement, has not been enough.\u201d\nCooper added: \u201cLonger-term, Ofgem will need to do more to make sure companies are financially sound and provide good customer service. This should include protecting people from the loyalty penalty, which prior to the cap allowed companies to profit from those who didn\u2019t or couldn\u2019t switch.\u201d\nThe energy regulator set out plans for \u201cbold action\u201d last week to fasttrack changes to its price cap, which protects around 15 million households from unfair energy bills, following growing calls from suppliers to make the cap more flexible so that market increases can be passed on to households sooner.\nThe price cap overhaul has emerged amid deepening concerns that gas prices, which are more than three times higher than this time last year, may resume their upward climb as temperatures plunge across Europe and Russia squeezes gas exports to Europe.\nGas flows from Russia\u2019s state-owned gas giant Gazprom, which supplies about a third of Europe\u2019s gas, dropped significantly over the weekend and on Tuesday the company declined to offer extra gas supplies to Europe from January, when demand is often at its highest for the winter.\nThe slowdown in gas exports has reignited fears over the winter\u2019s energy suppliers despite a direct order from the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, for Gazprom to focus on filling its European gas storage facilities from 8 November, when Russian domestic storage should be filled.\nRussia\u2019s decision not to open its gas taps to allow extra supplies into Europe from January also defies calls from the global energy watchdog, the International Energy Agency, which said last month that Russia should help to ease market prices by boosting gas exports to Europe this winter.\nMoscow has denied it is withholding gas supplies from Europe via its pipelines through Ukraine and Poland to exert pressure on German regulators to approve gas shipments through the new Nord Stream 2 pipeline across the Baltic Sea to Germany.\nBut its decision to send only contracted volumes despite the strong demand for extra gas supplies is likely to raise gas market prices across Europe, helping Russia to charge more for its hydrocarbon exports.",

The oddity of accounting rules around hedging policies meant BP showed a formal loss in the third quarter of this year, but the surer guide to the current financial bonanza was the underlying profit of $3.3bn (\u00a32.2bn). Remember that BP barely broke even in the equivalent period last year. The vaccine-led recovery in the global economy has transformed the outlook.\nSo time for BP to revisit its year-old targets for boosting investment in renewables? Use the current excess of cash to up the pace? Well, no, that is not on the agenda. Looney is sticking to what he promised: a doubling of investment in low-carbon projects this year to $2bn, mainly offshore wind and solar, with an increase to $5bn a year by 2030. The extra cash will instead go to shareholders.\nThe share buyback pledges, it has to be said, are large. The cash machine has been programmed to buy a further $1.25bn of shares before next February. Then the buybacks will continue at rate of at least $1bn a quarter as long as oil prices stay above $60 a barrel. That\u2019s on top of a dividend worth $4bn a year. In round terms, BP\u2019s distributions to shareholders are back where they stood before the pandemic: the dividend has been roughly halved, but buybacks would make up the difference.\nNaturally, BP would argue \u2013 with some justification \u2013 that its investors would scream blue murder if they were denied their buyback spoils when oil and gas prices are high. The promise of extra distributions in good times was part of the same \u201cfinancial framework\u201d that plots BP\u2019s intended path to net zero by 2050 \u2013 a framework that is meant to withstand any plunge in oil and gas prices. After a single lap of the track, there was no chance of Looney rejigging the arithmetic to accelerate renewables further.\nBut it is the next question if oil is still at $85 this time next year. In the \u201ctransformation\u201d business, which is what BP says it is doing, pace matters. It is not compulsory to throw every spare dollar at share buybacks.\nBlackRock has been an investor in THG, or The Hut Group as it was, for about a decade, so well before the ecommerce retailer arrived on the stock market a year ago. The world\u2019s largest fund manager even bought more stock in the IPO, or flotation, emerging as the second-largest holder after founder Matthew Moulding.\nThe decision to flog almost half the stake \u2013 or 58m shares \u2013 therefore looks significant. There was some muttering about portfolio rebalancing, but none of it convincing. There\u2019s only one way to read events when you\u2019re a buyer at IPO at 500p and large seller at 195p a year later: you\u2019ve changed your view of the long-term risks and rewards.\nNaturally, THG\u2019s share price moved almost directly to the BlackRock\u2019s disposal price, implying a fall on the day of 9%. January\u2019s zany valuation of 800p feels a world away. Moulding, trying to fight the crisis by belatedly preaching a gospel of governance reform, needs to find a credible non-executive chairman sharpish. BlackRock has not made the task easier.\nBookies always publicise the brief periods when the punters win. It\u2019s good for business. So the \u00a360m hit from \u201cunfavourable sporting results\u201d got star billing within Flutter\u2019s update. Champions League football, international football, American football and Tyson Fury got the blame (or credit).\nIt was enough for a downwards tweak to Flutter\u2019s annual profits forecast, though \u00a31.25bn-ish still sounds OK. All that has happened is a touch of mean reversion. The Paddy Power and Betfair group\u2019s win margin had been a fraction better than normal earlier in the year.\nThe share price, after its rip-roaring run on the back of prospects in the liberalising US market, fell 8%. But at least part of the drop can be explained by the lack of the fresh news on the idea of listing the US FanDuel business, the local number one in a sports betting market that could be enormous.\nLogic says it will happen because US market valuations for betting businesses are so much higher. The odd footie result is almost irrelevant by comparison. Having whetted appetites, Flutter can\u2019t maintain the suspense indefinitely.",

It appointed brokers Berenberg to handle the sale to \u201celigible investors\u201d. The exact price of the share sale was set to be determined through a rapid sale process called an \u201caccelerated bookbuild\u201d.\nThe move will raise further fears among investors of a significant sell-off among other top shareholders in Darktrace, which has seen about \u00a32bn wiped off its market value in a little over a week.\nThe company\u2019s biggest stockholders at the time of Darktrace\u2019s flotation were Summit Partners, the Autonomy founder, Mike Lynch and his wife, Angela Bacares, and KKR and EBT.\nSenior managers and directors at Darktrace hold about 5% of the company\u2019s shares with Poppy Gustafsson, co-founder and chief executive, holding 2.77m shares, about 0.4%.\nLast month, KKR, Summit and Balderton Capital sold \u00a3187.5m worth of stock, 25m shares when Darktrace was trading at 759.5p, a combined 3.6% stake.

He does not have the solution to every structural issue and it helped that he was prepared to listen when his assistant, Arno Michels, laid out the plan that lifted a stuttering display from Chelsea, who were far more incisive after moving Hakim Ziyech to the left and sending Callum Hudson-Odoi to the right with instructions to break Malmo\u2019s stubborn resistance by putting his speedy dribbling to good use.\nMichel\u2019s ploy soon worked. The right-footed Hudson-Odoi had produced little on the left during the first half, slowing Chelsea\u2019s momentum by cutting inside too much, but he was liberated after moving to the opposite flank. The winger was far too quick for S\u00f8ren Rieks and Franz Brorsson on the left side of Malm\u00f6\u2019s defence and he played a prominent role when the breakthrough arrived early in the second half, flying down the right wing and crossing for Ziyech to settle Chelsea\u2019s nerves on a night when they were regularly pushed out of their comfort zone by limited but spirited opposition.\n\u201cWe got the job done,\u201d Tuchel said. \u201cI think maybe now we get judged by results, but who doesn\u2019t? We needed the result, we expected the result, and we delivered. We had a lot of shots in the first half but it was not clinical enough. We wanted to increase the intensity level in the second half to force a goal. In the moment of the highest pressure we were able to use this moment with precision. It was a deserved win.\u201d\nUltimately one moment of class was enough for Chelsea, who remain hopeful of finishing top of Group H, although they will need to be sharper when they host Juventus later this month. This was a laboured performance from the European champions, who travelled to Sweden without N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9, Mateo Kovacic, Romelu Lukaku, Mason Mount and Timo Werner, and they were uncharacteristically slack at times. Malm\u00f6, beaten 4-0 at Stamford Bridge last month, put up a good fight.\nChelsea, who have won their last seven games in all competitions, did not make life easy for themselves. They seemed surprised when Malm\u00f6 pressed them during the early stages, a boisterous crowd roaring the Swedish champions forward, and Tuchel had reasons to be concerned as half-time approached. There was a carelessness to his team\u2019s passing at times and there was even a chance for Malm\u00f6 to go ahead after 11 minutes, a sloppy error from Ruben Loftus-Cheek forcing Andreas Christensen to mop up as Sebastian Nanasi threatened to break through on the left.\nLoftus-Cheek, who had not started in the Champions League since 2015, was not the only player in blue who erred during an absorbing opening period. Ziyech and Hudson-Odoi made a complete mess of a short corner routine on the left and Malm\u00f6 grew bolder as the half wore on, Antonio Colak going close to shocking Chelsea when he met Sergio Pe\u00f1a\u2019s pass with a volley inches wide.\nNonetheless there was always a sense that Chelsea\u2019s quality would make the difference. Loftus-Cheek offered some classy touches in midfield after getting that early error out of his system and Malm\u00f6 were clinging on at times, their defending increasingly frantic as the visitors began to dominate.\nChelsea, who were pleased to see Christian Pulisic come off the bench to make his first appearance since August after shaking off a persistent ankle injury, should have led at the break. C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta threatened from the edge of the area, Ziyech had a shot smothered after bursting through on goal and Kai Havertz was wasteful after being played through by Loftus-Cheek, a heavy touch giving Johan Dahlin the chance to block.\nThe goal eventually arrived. Tuchel had switched his wingers at the break, shifting Ziyech to the left and moving Hudson-Odoi to the right, and the change soon paid off. After 56 minutes Havertz dropped deep and slipped a clever pass through to Hudson-Odoi, who charged down the wing before producing a moment of decisiveness, whipping a bending cross to the far post for Ziyech to clip past Dahlin from close range.\n\u201cAll credit to my assistant,\u201d Tuchel said. \u201cHe had the idea. We liked it. Malm\u00f6 were defending in a low block. We lost some moments if Callum or Hakim had to switch back.\u201d\nMalm\u00f6, rooted to the bottom of the group after losing their first four games, were unable to respond. Jon Dahl Tomasson\u2019s side tired as the game wore on and the only disappointment for Tuchel was that Chelsea failed to extend their lead, Dahlin denying Havertz.\nIt made no difference in the end. Chelsea were too strong. Their tactical intelligence continues to set them apart.",

The Italian, who won the Premier League with Chelsea in 2017, replaces Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo, who was sacked on Monday.\nThe Spurs chairman, Daniel Levy, felt that he had to act after Saturday\u2019s 3-0 home loss to Manchester United and he rekindled his interest in Conte, who he had tried to hire in June as the permanent successor to Jos\u00e9 Mourinho.\nConte has been a promised a degree of control over transfer business, alongside Fabio Paratici, the managing director of football, with whom he had a successful spell at Juventus from 2011-14. Levy has assured Conte that he will always back him for the right player. Sales will, however, remain vital to the size of the budget.\n\u201cI am extremely happy to return to coaching, and to do so at a Premier League club that has the ambition to be a protagonist again,\u201d said Conte, who won Serie A with Internazionale last season. \u201cTottenham Hotspur has state-of-the-art facilities and one of the best stadiums in the world.\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait to start working to convey to the team and the fans the passion, mentality and determination that have always distinguished me, as a player and as a coach.\nBuongiorno Antonio... pic.twitter.com/26wgcdcYED\n\u201cLast summer our union did not happen because the end of my relationship with Inter was still too recent and emotionally too involved with the end of the season, so I felt that it wasn\u2019t yet the right time to return to coaching. But the contagious enthusiasm and determination of Daniel Levy in wanting to entrust me with this task had already hit the mark. Now that the opportunity has returned, I have chosen to take it with great conviction.\u201d\nConte met the players and observed training on Tuesday afternoon in preparation for Thursday\u2019s Europa Conference League game at home to Vitesse. The club fully expect his work permit to have come through in time for him to take the team at that match. On Sunday Spurs travel to Everton in the Premier League, in which they are ninth after five defeats in their opening 10 games.\nParatici said: \u201cWe are delighted to welcome Antonio to the club. His track record speaks for itself, with vast experience and trophies in both Italy and England. I know first-hand the qualities Antonio can bring to us, having worked with him at Juventus, and look forward to seeing his work with our talented group of players.\u201d",

Youth services prevent serious youth violence that costs taxpayers and ruins young people\u2019s lives.\u201d\n\u201cGiven how much has been stripped away from youth services over the last decade by the Conservatives, this disguised cut from the government is likely to force many grassroots youth organisations to close.\u201d\nAs MPs continued to debate the budget in the House of Commons on Wednesday, Labour MPs accused Sunak of failing to make up for more than a decade of austerity \u2013 comparing his promise of new \u201cfamily hubs,\u201d to the more than 500 Sure Start centres scrapped since 2010, for example.\nA spokesperson for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport conceded that the \u00a3560m promised by Sunak would include the cost of running the pre-existing NCS, which was set up by David Cameron.\n\u201cWe are determined to give every child the best start in life and level up opportunity across the country,\u201d they said. \u201cLast week we announced plans to invest \u00a3560m to make sure youth services get the support they need. This includes funding the construction or refurbishment of up to 300 youth facilities in the most deprived areas of the country, and supporting the running of the NCS over the next three years.\u201d\nThe spokesperson also pointed to almost \u00a35bn set aside for helping school pupils catch up with lost learning in the wake of the pandemic \u2013 though that is significantly less than was recommended by the government\u2019s own adviser on the issue, , who quit in protest.\nSunak\u2019s third budget included a slew of spending promises, as the Conservatives seek to live up to their promise to \u201clevel up\u201d neglected parts of the UK; but he also held out the prospect of tax cuts in the run-up to the next election.",

        "content": "Bertie Booster wanted to share his excitement as the world of the rich and powerful played out in public\nMake sense of it if you can. Yesterday morning the time was one minute to midnight and humanity was 5-1 down to climate change. Today the time must be at least 50 seconds to midnight and we have clawed back a goal. Or possibly two. Presumably the second one is still being checked by VAR. So the score is either 5-2 or 5-3. Boris Johnson didn\u2019t seem to know which as he prepared to leave Cop26 in Glasgow.\nThough he did think we were probably heading into extra time. At least that seemed to be the gist of what Johnson had to say, though it was hard to tell as he gives no sign of knowing how football works. In the clash of metaphors, the first casualty is clarity.\nThere again it wasn\u2019t entirely obvious why the prime minister had called a press conference in the first place as he didn\u2019t really have anything much to say. The only logical conclusion was that he had got a bit carried away. He had clearly come to Glasgow expecting the conference to be a total disaster and was relieved to discover that it had all gone a bit better than he expected. Bertie Booster was now cautiously optimistic that world leaders would find enough they could agree on to make it look as if some progress had been made and he wanted to share his excitement with someone.\nNot that he wanted to raise hopes massively. But 122 nations had agreed to tackle deforestation, 90% of the world was committed to net zero, big strides forward had been made on methane and the developed countries were only going to be a little bit late in making good on an unambitious target of giving \u00a3100bn a year to developing countries. But that all had to be a good thing to have achieved in just two days, didn\u2019t it? At which point Boris relapsed into his James Bond fantasies and started talking about possibly cutting the right wires to defuse the bomb.\nUnderstandably the media didn\u2019t entirely share the prime minister\u2019s optimism. Many of the reporters have been to rather more Cop summits than Boris and have a better idea of how these things work. They know the bottom line for many of the world leaders is to come up with a few eye-catching headlines at the beginning of the conference so they can then nip back home \u2013 after congratulating each other on how much they had done to save the planet.\nWhether anything changed was neither here nor there. It was all about the optics. For 48 hours or so the private world of the rich and powerful was played out in public. So we had Boris hailing prime minister Narendra Modi as a hero of climate change because he had committed India to net zero by 2070. Which was at least 20 years too late as the planet would have burned by then. Any idea of taking the game into extra time was for the birds with that sort of target. But Modi had to be praised. Because he would then in turn praise Boris.\nAnd everyone deferred to Jeff Bezos. Because the founder of Amazon had promised $2bn to save the Amazon. No matter that he could have easily doubled that level of funding without feeling the pinch. At Cop26, generosity is a relative term. But the organisers couldn\u2019t have been more pleased to have him and his support. So no one dared question Jeff on the hypocrisy of his recent venture into space tourism. Jeff\u2019s carbon footprint cannot be questioned because he\u2019s got so much cash to give. Rather it\u2019s indulged, as he went on to say how life-changing his 10-minute space flight had been. \u201cOh Mr Bezos, you\u2019re so wonderful,\u201d sobbed the compere. See me, feel me, touch me.\nAnd it was this \u201cLifestyle par Jeff\u201d that Boris had fallen for and on which he got called out. How come no one was talking about China? Without the active engagement of the world\u2019s biggest polluter everyone was wasting their time. This was like being 5-2 down seconds from the end of the game and playing without two of your star strikers. Johnson didn\u2019t even pretend to have an answer. Things would just work out somehow because they always had in the past. Even if they hadn\u2019t. The trick was to believe.\nThe questions didn\u2019t ease up. How could the world trust Brazil to keep its promises given Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s track record of destroying the rainforest? Boris shrugged. He was sure the Brazilian president would keep his word this time and besides, people would stop buying goods sourced from Brazil if he didn\u2019t. Dream on. Then reality bit. The developing countries were already saying that none of this was enough. They faced annihilation if global temperatures weren\u2019t restricted to a 1.5C rise and even with the new agreements we were nowhere near that. And the developed world needed to stump up far more than the \u00a3100bn a year that it was already not providing.\n\u201cLook, I don\u2019t want to sugar-coat this,\u201d said Bertie Booster. But he did. As that\u2019s what he always does. He can\u2019t cope with too much reality. Just like so many others at Cop26, it\u2019s the illusion of having made a difference that counts. With that, Boris left to go home. He did feel a bit guilty about the private jet, but it was a lot smaller than some other world leaders\u2019 planes, and he could always plant a tree in Downing Street. That should offset the carbon emissions.\nA Farewell to Calm by John Crace (Guardian Faber, \u00a39.99). To support The Guardian and Observer, order your copy at guardianbookshop.com.

They arrested a man a short time later.\nThe WA police commissioner, Chris Dawson, told the ABC that police had a 36-year-old man in custody. He said there was \u201cno family connection\u201d.\nThe house she was found in was declared a forensic scene with police officers combing through it, looking for extra evidence that will help piece together how she was taken.\n\u201cTo find a little girl, a vulnerable little girl, after 18 days, you know, obviously people think the worst, but importantly, hope was never lost,\u201d Dawson said. \u201cThe fact she\u2019s been found alive \u2026 I think Australia is rejoicing, you know, it is such a wonderful outcome.\u201d\nDawson said the community in WA, and particularly in Carnarvon, deserved credit for helping with the investigation after police received information about a car connected to her disappearance.\nCleo\u2019s mother, Ellie Smith, posted on Instagram at about 6am local time about her daughter\u2019s discovery with the caption \u201cour family is whole again\u201d.\nThe police deputy commissioner, Col Blanch, said police had broken into the locked house and found the girl in one of the rooms.\n\u201cIt\u2019s my privilege to announce that in the early hours of this morning, the Western Australia police force rescued Cleo Smith,\u201d he said.\n\u201cCleo is alive and well. One of the officers picked her up into his arms and asked her, \u2018What\u2019s your name?\u2019 She said, \u2018My name is Cleo\u2019.\u201d\nCleo was reunited with her parents a short time later.\nThe four-year-old vanished from the Blowholes campsite near Carnarvon on 16 October.\nHer mother was the last known person to see her. Smith said her daughter had woken up about 1.30am asking for water before going back to bed. In the morning Cleo and her sleeping bag were gone from the family\u2019s tent.\n\u201cThis is the outcome we all hoped and prayed for,\u201d Blanch said.\nThe Carnarvon shire president, Eddie Smith, told 2GB radio he had realised something was going on when his phone started ringing on Wednesday.\n\u201cMy phone started to ring flat out and I knew there was something going on here,\u201d he said. \u201cCleo Smith had been found. I rang the police and they told me it was correct.\u201d\nAustralia\u2019s leaders were quick to express their joy at the news and to thank the police and others who had searched for Cleo over two harrowing weeks.\nThe prime minister, Scott Morrison, called Cleo\u2019s discovery \u201cwonderful, relieving news\u201d.\n\u201cThe fact that that nightmare has come to an end and our worst fears were not realised, is just a huge relief and a moment for great joy,\u201d Morrison said during a press conference in Dubai on Wednesday.\nMorrison said Cleo\u2019s disappearance had \u201ccaptured the hearts of Australians as we felt such terrible sorrow for the family\u201d.\n\u201cI want to thank, particularly, all of the police and all of those who were involved in making sure that Cleo is safe and we are so thankful\u2026I just thank God that Cleo is home and that she is safe,\u201d Morrison said.\nThe Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, said it was \u201csuch happy news\u201d. \u201cTo all those who tirelessly searched for this little girl, you deserve our thanks.\u201d\nBlanch said the outcome was down to \u201csome incredible police work\u201d.\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\n\u201cI want to thank Cleo\u2019s parents, the Western Australian community and the many volunteers. And of course, I want to thank my colleagues in the Western Australia police force.\u201d\nThe NSW police commissioner, Mick Fuller, told 2GB his WA counterpart, Dawson, told him he had broken down and cried at the news.\nFuller said he had thought the chances of finding Cleo alive were \u201cso slim\u201d.\n\u201cWest Australian police never gave up on Cleo: it was good old-fashioned police work that resulted in her being found alive,\u201d Fuller said.\nBlanch said the man in custody was being questioned by detectives.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have more to say on the rescue of Cleo as the day unfolds,\u201d Blanch said. \u201cFor now \u2013 welcome home Cleo.\u201d\nA press conference was expected to be held mid-morning Perth time.\nDet Insp Jon Rouse, the manager of victim identification at the Australian Centre to Counter Child Exploitation, said he had emailed colleagues in WA early on Wednesday morning to congratulate them. Rouse said he had seen the heartbreak when children could not be recovered, including the tragic case of the Queensland boy Daniel Morcombe, who was abducted from a bus stop in 2003.\nA taskforce of 100 police officers, led by Det Supt Rod Wilde, had been based out of Carnarvon for 18 days looking for clues into Cleo\u2019s disappearance. They used reconnaissance planes to carry out real-time surveillance.\nThe position of the zipper on the tent flap \u2013 too high for Cleo to reach \u2013 suggested she had not opened the tent herself.\n\u201cThe positioning of that zipper for the flap is one of the circumstances that has caused us to have grave concerns for Cleo\u2019s safety,\u201d Insp John Munday said five days into the search.\nThat prompted police to pursue the \u201cnightmare scenario\u201d that she had been abducted.\nCleo\u2019s mother maintained throughout the ordeal that Cleo would never have left the tent on her own.",

A very big number for Rishi Sunak to boast about, that\u2019s what. About $130tn (\u00a395tn) to be precise.\nThe chancellor, who is kicking off tomorrow\u2019s finance day at the Cop26 conference, will say that 40% of the world\u2019s financial assets is now owned by institutions aligned with the Paris 2015 goal of limiting the increase in global temperature to no more than 1.5C of pre-industrial levels.\nThat may sound as if $130tn, equivalent to one-and-a-half times annual global output, is going to be unleashed to green the economy, but that is not remotely the case.\nWhat Sunak will be saying is that the 450 firms, including investment managers such as BlackRock and banks such as HSBC, have signed up to climate goals under the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero. It doesn\u2019t mean that the $130tn will be spent on net carbon zero projects and, indeed, does not prevent the continued investment in fossil fuels.\nThe chancellor is optimistic that the commitments by big finance could create a huge pool of cash to fund the net zero transition but \u201ccould\u201d is not the same as \u201cwill\u201d. It is unlikely that more than a fraction of the $130tn will be invested in green projects, in the short term at least.\nSunak will also announce that within the next year or so UK financial institutions and quoted companies will have to publish net zero transition plans outlining how they will decarbonise their activities. Setting an example is one way the government can make a difference to the fight against the climate crisis, because while the UK accounts for only 1% of global emissions it has one of the world\u2019s biggest financial sectors.\nThis doesn\u2019t mean investments in carbon-intensive activities will not be allowed, but the government is setting up a taskforce made of figures from industry, academia, regulatory bodies and civil society groups, which will establish a science-based \u201cgold standard\u201d for transition plans to minimise the risk of \u201cgreenwashing\u201d.

Juve won a penalty just before the hour, only for Dybala to fire wide \u2013 but the referee ordered a retake and this time the Argentinian scored.\nFederico Chiesa and \u00c1lvaro Morata added late goals for Juventus before the Russian side grabbed a late consolation through Sardar Azmoun. Juve go to Stamford Bridge on 23 November to face Chelsea, in a game that is likely to decide who tops the group.\nIn Group G, Lille fought back to upset Sevilla with a 2-1 away win that leaves the Spanish side at risk of an early exit. Lucas Ocampos put the hosts in front on the rebound after 15 minutes, but the French champions levelled through a Jonathan David penalty just before half time, awarded by the VAR.\nLille stayed on the front foot in the second half and were rewarded when Jonathan Ikon\u00e9 scored what proved to be the winner. The forward was first to react after Zeki Celik\u2019s shot came back off the far post. Earlier, Wolfsburg beat the leaders Red Bull Salzburg 2-1 to keep Group G very much up for grabs with two games to play.\nIn Group F, Villarreal shook off speculation linking Unai Emery with the vacant managerial post at Newcastle, beating Young Boys 2-0 at home. \u00c9tienne Capoue and Arnaut Danjuma got the goals as the hosts boosted their hopes of reaching the knockout stages as they moved level with Manchester United at the top of the group.",

With numbers in the main plenary hall limited, Australians gathered there to watch Scott Morrison\u2019s address to the conference on Monday.\nSpace in the pavilion has been dedicated to Australian businesses, including Andrew Forrest\u2019s green-hydrogen focused Fortescue Future Industries, Sun Cable, which plans to send solar energy captured in the Northern Territory to Singapore and Mineral Carbonation International. Alongside them is the oil and gas giant Santos.\nAt the front of the pavilion on Tuesday was a Santos demonstration of its Moomba carbon capture and storage project in outback South Australia. Santos confirmed on Monday that the A$220m development would go ahead after the government announced it could receive carbon credit revenue from taxpayers through the emissions reduction fund. Australia\u2019s energy and emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, joined Santos\u2019 chief executive, Kevin Gallagher, at the pavilion to trumpet the announcement.\nThe former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, who is in Glasgow as the chair of the Fortescue Future Industries, said it was \u201ca pity\u201d Australia had not signed up to the pledge and \u201ca joke\u201d that Santos had been given prime placement.\n\u201cLook at the Australian stand \u2013 you\u2019ve got a gas company highlighted apparently at the insistence of the energy minister, who thinks that our energy policy should be all about burning gas,\u201d Turnbull told reporters. \u201cThe whole object is to stop burning fossil fuels.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to cut all greenhouse gas emissions, methane and CO2, particularly. We can\u2019t keep on pretending that this is a problem we can push out on to the future. We are living with the reality of global warming now.\u201d\nTaylor spoke at the pavilion alongside the Santos chief while launching the government\u2019s latest low-emissions technology statement \u2013 an annual update of its technology-driven approach to climate change. CCS is one of six priority technologies chosen to get government support.\nThe minister said Santos\u2019 CCS development at Moomba, which if successful will capture 1.7m tonnes of carbon dioxide a year from 2024, was a \u201cvery elegant project\u201d that would allow it to produce gas while reducing emissions. Taylor said there were many different types of CCS but it was initially likely to be used in gas production sites and in the development of \u201cblue\u201d hydrogen using gas.\n\u201cWe can do exactly the same at Moomba and other places in the production of hydrogen,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not new, it\u2019s very, very important, it\u2019s going to be particularly important for the gas industry.\u201d\nAsked about the global methane pledge, he said Australia\u2019s focus was \u201cwhole of economy, all gasses\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re not setting sector-specific targets and we\u2019re not setting gas-specific targets,\u201d he said.\nTaylor last week claimed signing up to the pledge would mean cut agricultural herd numbers, and the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, said the only way to meet it would be to \u201cstart shooting your cattle\u201d. Bill Hare, the chief executive of research firm Climate Analytics, said this was not correct.\nThe government\u2019s 2050 net-zero emissions plan has been criticised for including no new policies and relying on new technology to make emissions cuts in the 2030s and 40s. Its support for CCS technology \u2013 both burying greenhouse gases from industrial sites kilometres underground and potentially using captured carbon dioxide to make products \u2013 includes $250m for a \u201cCCS technologies and hubs\u201d program.\nAustralian governments have committed about $4bn in funding for CCS over time, but it is yet to prove commercially viable at scale. The country has one operating CCS plant, at Chevron\u2019s Gorgon gas development in Western Australia. It has suffered repeated delays and captures only a portion of the emissions at the site.\nThe Greens\u2019 environment spokesperson, Sarah Hanson-Young, who is also in Glasgow, said the Morrison government was spending Cop26 \u201cbusy hanging out with fossil fuel executives and hosting PR stunts for the gas industry\u201d.\nThe Australian Conservation Foundation said Australia was acting \u201cshamelessly\u201d. \u201cMake no mistake, the Morrison government\u2019s preoccupation with CCS is about keeping coal and gas Australia\u2019s energy system longer, and delaying the transition to renewable energy with storage,\u201d said ACF\u2019s climate program manager, Gavan McFadzean.\nTaylor said the government was backing renewable energy by adding \u201cultra low-cost solar\u201d as a priority in the new technology statement, as flagged last week when the government released its plan to reach net zero emissions by 2050. Cutting the price of solar further would be key to producing hydrogen made with renewable energy at scale, he said.\n\u201cWe welcome all forms of clean hydrogen production \u2013 green, blue \u2013 they are important,\u201d he said. \u201cYou will see green growing rapidly over time, we certainly hope.\u201d",

Survival rates are generally good, which is largely because of screening, early diagnosis and improved treatment.\nHowever, until now, little has been known about the risk of secondary breast cancer, where the disease spreads to other parts of the body and becomes incurable.\nA meta analysis of more than 400 studies has found the risk of breast cancer spreading to another part of the body ranges from 6% to 22%. The results of the study are being presented at the sixth International Consensus Conference for Advanced Breast Cancer .\nThe findings also suggest certain women face a higher risk, including those diagnosed with breast cancer under the age of 35, those with larger tumours when initially diagnosed and those with specific types of the disease, for example luminal B.\nKotryna Temcinaite, senior research communications manager at the charity Breast Cancer Now, said the analysis \u201cprovides helpful insight into who is most at risk\u201d.\n\u201cAbout 1,000 women in the UK die each month from incurable secondary breast cancer,\u201d she said. \u201cWe desperately need to learn more about this devastating disease so that we can find new ways to improve treatment, care and support for people living with it, and for those living in fear of a diagnosis.\n\u201cThe data shows that people diagnosed with primary breast cancer aged 35 years or younger have the greatest chance of developing secondary breast cancer. The study also highlights that the size of the tumour, the type of breast cancer and the length of time since primary diagnosis can impact a person\u2019s risk.\n\u201cSecondary breast cancer can develop many years after an initial cancer diagnosis, so it\u2019s vital that we understand it better and find new ways to prevent it.\u201d\nFor the study, researchers analysed data on tens of thousands of women across more than 400 studies from North and South America, Europe, Africa, Asia and Oceania.\nThe analysis suggests the overall risk of metastasis for most breast cancer patients is between 6% and 22%. Researchers say the range is broad because the risk varies significantly depending on a whole range of different factors.\nFor example, women first diagnosed under the age of 35 have a 12.7% to 38% risk of their breast cancer coming back and spreading to other parts of the body, while women aged 50 years or older have a risk of 3.7% to 28.6%.\n\u201cThis may be because younger women have a more aggressive form of breast cancer or because they are being diagnosed at a later stage,\u201d said the presenter of the study, Dr Eileen Morgan, of the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC).\n\u201cBreast cancer is the most common form of cancer in the world,\u201d she said. \u201cMost women are diagnosed when their cancer is confined to the breast or has only spread to nearby tissue. But in some women, the cancer will grow and spread to other parts of the body or come back in a different part of the body several years after the end of their initial treatment.\n\u201cAt this point the cancer becomes much harder to treat and the risk of dying is higher. However, we don\u2019t really know how many people develop metastatic breast cancer because cancer registries have not been routinely collecting this data.\u201d\nThe study also found women with specific types of breast cancer appeared to have a higher risk of it spreading, for example those with a type of cancer called luminal B.\nThose with this form had a 4.2% to 35.5% risk of it spreading compared with 2.3% to 11.8% risk in women diagnosed with luminal A cancer.\nDr Shani Paluch-Shimon, a member of the conference\u2019s scientific committee and director of the breast unit at Hadassah University hospital in Israel, who was not involved with the research, said the findings were \u201cvital\u201d for patients and doctors.",

The vehicles produce zero exhaust emissions, helping to address the impacts on health and the climate caused by urban transport.\nThere were stark divergences among different European capitals. The usage of electric cars ranged from 9% of miles driven in Lisbon, to 6% in London and Amsterdam, and only 0.01% in Brussels, according to internal Uber data shared with Transport & Environment (T&E), a thinktank. The other laggards were Madrid, at only 0.15% of miles, Berlin at 0.55% and Paris at 1%.\nHowever, Uber\u2019s data showed rapid increases in electric miles in some cities. In London only 1.6% of miles driven were electric in the first half of 2020, meaning the share more than tripled in the year since. In Berlin the share of electric miles fell during the same period.\nUber faces a difficult task in electrifying quickly because the cars are bought by drivers. On Wednesday it announced that London Uber drivers could put money raised via the app\u2019s clean air fee towards buying Tesla electric cars, adding to similar programmes giving discounts on Nissan, Kia and Hyundai electric cars.\nT&E said the divergent paths taken by different cities highlighted the need for local and national regulations to promote electric cars.\nSaul Lopez, electric fleets programme manager at T&E, said:\n\u201cUber should be doing more but so should governments. In Amsterdam and London it\u2019s cleaning up its fleet faster because the authorities have set up electrification mandates and effective ultra-low emissions zones.\u201d\nUber, headquartered in San Francisco, introduced its 2025 target following criticism of its environmental credentials, along with rivals such as Bolt and Lyft. Uber is aiming for 100% electric cars worldwide by 2040.\nA taxi ride generally uses more energy than the same trip via public transport, although Uber and other ride-hailing companies argue they will contribute to lowering emissions through a more efficient transport system.\nAnabel Diaz, a regional general manager for Uber, backed the call for government action to promote the use of electric vehicles.\nShe added: \u201cThese first steps towards our ambitious electrification commitments were always going to be the most challenging given the pandemic, but drivers in Europe are switching to EVs well ahead of the average European consumer.\u201d",

In Minneapolis and elsewhere, calls for major changes to law enforcement, including defunding police departments, soon followed.\nIf the \u201cyes\u201d vote had won, the Minneapolis police department would have been replaced with a department run by a nominated commissioner who would be approved by the city council.\nThe projected department would have used a \u201ccomprehensive public health approach\u201d outlined by the mayor and city council via ordinances. Mandatory minimum police staffing would also be erased from the city charter.\nSupporters argued it was a chance to reimagine what public safety could be and how money was spent. Among other changes, supporters said, funding would have gone toward programs that did not send armed officers to call on people in crisis.\nThe idea won wide support among many progressive groups who pointed out that it would have changed the nature of policing in the city \u2013 not gotten rid of law enforcement. \u201c\u200b\u200bIt\u2019s a vote for us to all reimagine public safety and to move away from the type of systems that have not produced safety for all communities,\u201d said Rashad Robinson, a spokesperson for Color of Change Pac, which organized support for the referendum.\nOpponents said the proposal contained no concrete plan for how to move forward and warned it would leave some communities already affected by violence more vulnerable as crime was on the rise.\n\u201cTonight Minneapolis voters have made clear that we want a planful approach to transforming policing and public safety in our city that needs to include meaningful consultation with the communities that are most impacted by both violent crime and by over-policing,\u201d said Leili Fatehi, manager of the All of Mpls campaign, which advocated for a \u201cno\u201d vote on the measure.\nThe policing amendment earned the support of several prominent progressive Democrats, including the US congresswoman Ilhan Omar, who represents the Minneapolis area, and the state attorney general, Keith Ellison. But other prominent figures, including the Minnesota governor, Tim Walz, and the US senators Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith, opposed it and feared the backlash could lead to Democratic losses across the country in 2022.\nRishi Khanna, 31, a tech worker, voted \u201cyes\u201d on replacing the police department, saying he didn\u2019t believe police officers were qualified to deal with many situations, such as mental health crises. He said he thought having professionals equipped to deal with a range of public safety issues in the same department as law enforcement would benefit both residents and police officers.\n\u201cI understand that law enforcement will have to have a seat at the table, but I think both in our community and in communities around the country, too often law enforcement is the only seat at the table,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s the right solution.\u201d\nAskari Lyons, 61, voted against the ballot initiative. A resident of the city\u2019s largely Black north side, he said he believed Minneapolis police officers \u201cmay have learned a lesson after George Floyd\u2019s death and what happened to the cop that killed him\u201d.\nLyons called it \u201cunwise\u201d to replace the department and said he believed change within the department was imminent.\n\u201cPeople are so frustrated, so angry, so disappointed\u201d with the violence occurring citywide as much as they are with the city\u2019s law enforcement, he said.\nMinister JaNa\u00e9 Bates, a spokeswoman for the pro-amendment campaign, told reporters Monday that even if the proposal failed, the activists behind it had changed the conversation about public safety.\n\u201cNo matter what happens, the city of Minneapolis is going to have to move forward and really wrestle with what we cannot un-know: that the Minneapolis police department has been able to operate with impunity and has done quite a bit of harm and the city has to take some serious steps to rectify that,\u201d Bates said.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report",

About 72% of eligible M\u0101ori have had one dose of the Pfizer vaccine, compared with 85% of Pasifika and 88% of all people aged 12 and over.\nThe virus has been detected in at least three gangs, prompting health officials to some grant some leaders essential worker status, in order to engage hard to reach communities. Tam is among those given that status, saying \u201cwe are all vulnerable\u201d but children and elders are most at risk.\nStephen Daley of the Head Hunters, says he was vaccinated because he cares about his children and wishes to protect his whakapapa (genealogy). While he does not want to push the vaccine on people, he does want everyone to make \u201can informed decision\u201d.\nPaula Ormsby of Mongrel Mob Waikato Kingdom urged people to seek out Indigenous doctors who are experts on Covid-19, if they are feeling hesitant.\nTa\u2019alili To\u2019omalatai of the King Cobras speaks in Samoan first, before delivering his message in English, urging everyone to get their shot \u201cfor the safety of our community\u201d.\nBlack Power member Michael Te Pou says he is also a father, a grandfather an uncle and a brother. \u201cWe did this for our tamariki (children) and our mokopuna (grandchildren),\u201d he said.\nCriminologist Dr Jarrod Gilbert, told the Herald it was \u201cbrave\u201d of Jackson to publicly associate himself with such a broad range of people in gangs.\n\u201cThis is an example of what needs to happen if we\u2019re going to reach hard-to-reach communities \u2013 by using people who are respected in those communities.\u201d",

        "content": "Analysis identifies 56 new chemicals in water supplies \u2013 including some linked to critical diseases \nWater utilities and regulators in the US have identified 56 new contaminants in drinking water over the past two years, a list that includes dangerous substances linked to a range of health problems such as cancer, reproductive disruption, liver disease and much more.\nThe revelation is part of an analysis of the nation\u2019s water utilities\u2019 contamination records by the Environmental Working Group, a clean water advocate that has now updated its database for the first time since 2019.\nIt found that the jump is partly driven by newly identified PFAS, a toxic class of \u201cforever chemicals\u201d that are widely used across dozens of industries and are thought to be contaminating drinking water for more than 100 million people. Pesticides, water disinfectant byproducts and radioactive materials are among other substances identified by regulators.\nThough the new contaminant list is disturbing, it would be much longer if regulators and utilities were properly monitoring the nation\u2019s water supply, said the EWG senior scientist Tasha Stoiber.\n\u201cIt speaks to the fact that we don\u2019t have nearly strong enough regulations in place to protect drinking water, and the regulation process is much too slow,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re testing for things that are already in our drinking water after the fact \u2026 and we\u2019re not keeping pace with these chemicals.\u201d\nThe list includes some substances that have been in production and used for years, but are only now being monitored by regulators as their links to health problems become clear. Other contaminants include those that industry is only beginning to use in larger quantities.\nMany of the substances were identified as part of the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s unregulated contaminant monitoring rule (UMCR), which is one of the first steps in the regulation process. It tracks chemicals\u2019 presence in some water systems and its aim is to provide the EPA with a picture of how widespread a chemical\u2019s contamination is before new limits are established.\nAmong other substances detected is HAA-9, a byproduct of the drinking water disinfection process. Regulators previously set limits for HAA-5, a contaminant in the same family that was found to cause health problems. Industry claimed HAA-9 was safe, but recent studies linked it to low birthrate, so the EPA is beginning to track it.\nHowever, setting limits can be a lengthy process, and the EPA has failed to set a new limit under the UMCR in the 20 years since the rule was implemented. The agency found what Stoiber characterized as \u201ceye-opening\u201d levels of PFAS compounds in 2013 yet is aiming to set water limits for just two kinds by next year.\nOther contaminants in the new list were detected by states that are moving to put stricter regulations in place for chemicals, like PFAS.\nIn the meantime, there\u2019s little that people can do beyond educating themselves about which contaminants are in their water system, buying filters and advocating for stronger regulations. EWG\u2019s database allows users to search for contaminants in water systems by zip code, and it provides a guide on which chemicals water filters can remove.\n\u201cEveryone can be educated,\u201d Stoiber said. \u201cContact the local utility, ask them questions about what they\u2019re doing \u2026 and push for stronger regulations that protect people\u2019s health.\u201d",

        "content": "World Economic Forum says taxing carbon emitters would cost less than economic fallout from climate crisis\nCreating an international price for carbon emissions could reduce global greenhouse gases by 12% at a cost of less than 1% of global GDP, according to a new report from the World Economic Forum (WEF) and PwC.\nThe report found that if global governments agreed together to set a price for pollution to help cut carbon emissions the cost would be less than the economic losses triggered by the fallout of a runaway climate crisis.\nThe \u201ccarbon revenues\u201d raked in to government coffers from the world\u2019s most-polluting companies could also be used to help hard-pressed households or ploughed back into green industries which help reduce emissions while creating jobs and economic growth, the report found.\nBob Moritz, the global chair of auditing giant PwC, said setting a global carbon price could make a \u201csignificant contribution to tackling global warming by accelerating emissions reductions\u201d.\nThe report analysed a scheme proposed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) earlier this year to help accelerate the world\u2019s carbon emissions cuts by 2030 in a bid to stay within 1.5C to 2C of global heating compared with pre-industrialised levels, as set out under the Paris agreement in 2015.\n\u201cWe found this could be done without severe economic damage to livelihoods and business, although the effects would be somewhat uneven across the world. The costs to society and business of failing to act are far greater,\u201d Mortiz added.\nUnder the IMF scheme companies with high greenhouse gas emissions, in high-income countries, would be subject to a carbon price of $75 for every tonne of carbon dioxide emitted. This would fall to $50 a tonne for polluters in middle-income countries, and $25 a tonne for low-income countries.\nCurrently, the price of carbon is set at anywhere from $0 to more than $130 per tonne of CO2 equivalent across different global regions. In some cases this has created an uneven playing field by making it cheaper for international companies to move high-carbon activities, such as manufacturing, to countries without carbon schemes to avoid paying a price for pollution.\nBut WEF and PwC found widespread participation in carbon price set across the global economy, even at reduced price floors for low and middle-income countries, would lead to very little \u201ccarbon leakage\u201d from companies moving their manufacturing to countries where carbon prices are lower.\nB\u00f8rge Brende, the president of WEF, said although the findings of the report are \u201cextremely positive\u201d, a huge amount of cooperation between governments and private sector companies would be key for carbon pricing to move ahead and accelerate efforts for a more sustainable and inclusive recovery.\nThe political and technical challenges behind creating a global carbon price have stalled plans, leaving a patchwork of different international schemes to reduce carbon emissions which include mandatory emissions trading and carbon taxes, and voluntary carbon offset schemes.\nIn the UK, a carbon price floor was introduced in 2013 at a rate of only \u00a316 per tonne, and rose to \u00a318.08 (\u20ac20.40), which has managed to drive almost all of the UK\u2019s coal plants out of the electricity market in recent years. Coal power made up about 2% of electricity last year compared with around half of all power generation a decade ago.",

        "content": "The Hong Kong-raised Melbourne film-maker, who has two movies screening at Sydney film festival, reflects on the \u2018farcical\u2019 immigrant experience and being a pioneer of Asian Australian cinema\nWhen Clara Law\u2019s film Floating Life opened in Australian cinemas in 1996, the Hong Kong-raised, Melbourne-based writer-director did not expect it to pack such a strong cultural punch.\nAlong with being one of few local films to deal with the Asian migrant experience, Floating Life made history as Australia\u2019s first-ever submission in the best foreign language film category at the Academy Awards, and ignited a new generation of Asian Australian film-makers.\n\u201cI love hearing people talk about my film and saying, \u2018I\u2019m still thinking of the film\u2019,\u201d Law says. \u201cThat\u2019s what we [with her husband and constant collaborator, co-writer, Eddie Fong] want to do: make films that can stand the passage of time and can touch people\u2019s hearts hundreds of years later.\u201d\nThis year, Floating Life received a long-awaited digital restoration by the National Film and Sound Archive and will be presented on the big screen at the 2021 Sydney film festival alongside Law\u2019s latest feature film, Drifting Petals, a free-wandering elegy to the loss of her brother and the fading memories of her two home cities of Macau and Hong Kong.\nLaw describes Floating Life\u2019s tonal inflections as \u201cleaning towards the farcical\u201d. The story follows the Chan family\u2019s relocation from the bustling, steamy streets of Hong Kong to the sunburnt, open-concrete suburbia of Sydney.\nTinged with tragicomedy, the film is also laced with heightened emotions, as the family face the jarring cultural shocks associated with immigration \u2013 from the pressures of assimilation and intergenerational tensions down to the sharp physical contrast of the blinding Australian skies. In an amusingly staged scene, the Chans wear sunglasses inside their sparse, white home after being warned of the hole in the ozone layer.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I felt too when I first came to Australia,\u201d Law says. \u201cIt was all very strange to me but also very seductive \u2013 I wanted to recreate the feeling of this space, light and colour. With this distinctiveness, you feel the family spread all over, and not together. So, how and where can they find their home?\u201d\nSpeaking from her home in Melbourne where she has been based since the 1990s (she was born in Macau and raised in Hong Kong), Law\u2019s film-making career and more generally, life journey, has been shaped by a search for home.\nIn the early 1990s, she won awards across European and Asian film festivals for her independent Hong Kong arthouse features, notably Autumn Moon and Temptation of a Monk, the latter of which played in competition at the 1993 Venice film festival.\nShe then made three Australian films, including Floating Life and the 2000 Rose Byrne-led road movie The Goddess of 1967. Law has spent the past decade or so exploring new terrain within the Chinese film industry, making Like a Dream in Taiwan and The Unbearable Lightness of Inspector Fan in Shanghai.\n\u201cMy whole life has been travelling the world,\u201d she says. \u201cIt became natural to continue to make films [in Australia] when I thought there was more of a chance to make art films, compared to compromising in Hong Kong when we had to deal with more private funding. But with the change of government [in Australia], our funding was shrinking and then nonexistent.\u201d\nBeing uncompromisingly \u201coriginal and fresh\u201d is at the heart of Law\u2019s film-making ethos \u2013 in style and content. During our conversation, she constantly refers to her favourite film-makers, Yasujir\u014d Ozu, Michelangelo Antonioni and Andrei Tarkovsky.\n\u201cIt\u2019s how I was brought up,\u201d she says. \u201cTheir touch on your soul is so strong and so true, and I just want to hold on to that [feeling] for as many days as possible.\u201d\nLaw\u2019s latest film, Drifting Petals, is a continuation of her belief that \u201cfilm is an art first and foremost\u201d. An experimental self-funded \u201calternate cinema\u201d piece made over five years, Drifting Petals is inspired by WG Sebald\u2019s novels in its blending of travelogue, historical fact, fiction and memoir \u2013 and loosely follows a film-maker as she reconnects with a piano student in Hong Kong. A drifting camera follows them each separately as they confront long-lost memories, meeting those living and dead, and facing an uncertain future.\nThe free-spirited vision behind the project meant Law and Fong had no choice but to take a \u201cDIY-nano production\u201d approach. It saw the pair fulfilling most creative and practical elements themselves \u2013 sometimes resorting to YouTube tutorials to fill in the blanks.\nDespite its challenges, Law compares film-making to an addiction \u2013 \u201ca fire in the belly\u201d. \u201cI can\u2019t do things I don\u2019t like. It is to my disadvantage that I am like that,\u201d she laughs. \u201cIt is a hard thing to make films, but it consumes you. If I didn\u2019t think it was worth doing, then why am I doing it?\u201d\nIt\u2019s perhaps why Law thinks her and Fong\u2019s films are \u201ca bit ahead of [their] time\u201d: Floating Life initially opened as a small national release to modest reception.\n\u201cIt\u2019s OK,\u201d she says, almost forgivingly. \u201cFloating Life has helped spur [Asian-Australians] into their film-making careers, like [director] Corrie Chen, and I am glad to hear that has happened. It is like a relay, there is no ego there.\u201d\nFor her next project, The Little QiPao Shop, Law has also turned her lens on her adopted home. She describes it as a film for the \u201cnew generation\u201d \u2013 an intergenerational story centring on a 28-year-old Australian-born Chinese woman growing up between two cultures.\n\u201cI think there are still some [Asian Australian] stories in the pipeline for me,\u201d Law says. \u201cBut maybe I\u2019ll find something in Taiwan, in the UK, maybe here. There are always stories, and there are always interesting people.\u201d\nDrifting Petals and Floating Life are showing at the Sydney film festival 2021, which runs 3\u201321 November",

We look at what prompted the move and what it means for users\nFacebook has announced it is deleting about 1bn \u201cfaceprints\u201d it used as part of a facial recognition system for photo tagging, citing concerns with the technology.\nMeta, the company formally known as Facebook, announced on Tuesday it would end its use of facial recognition technology in the coming weeks. A third of Facebook\u2019s users, or about 1 billion people, had opted into the service, Meta\u2019s vice-president of artificial intelligence Jerome Pesenti said.\nSo is the company really concerned about people\u2019s privacy, or is it just a public relations move?\nWhen people opted in to allowing the use of facial recognition, Facebook scanned a \u201cfaceprint\u201d of that user and used it to find photos and videos of them on the platform, and suggested tagging them.\nIt was also used to identify if someone else was impersonating that user on Facebook, and helped with accessibility for people with visual impairments by telling them who was in a photo.\nPesenti said while facial recognition technology is a powerful tool to verify identity, it needs strong privacy and transparency controls to let people limit how their faces are used. He noted there were \u201cmany concerns\u201d about the place of facial recognition technology in society, with regulators still playing catch up.\n\u201cAmid this ongoing uncertainty, we believe that limiting the use of facial recognition to a narrow set of use cases is appropriate,\u201d he said.\nPesenti said facial recognition was most valuable when operating on a person\u2019s device only \u2013 such as for unlocking iPhones \u2013 rather than communicating with an external server, as Facebook\u2019s technology had operated.\nIt comes at a time when Facebook has faced widespread criticism over its attitude towards user privacy and safety, after the release of tens of thousands of internal documents from Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen.\nA spokesperson for Facebook said there would be no change to existing tagged photos or videos that were tagged using the technology, just that there will not be a suggested tag in the future.\nPeople will still be able to add text and tags to their photos and videos, but Facebook won\u2019t automatically suggest them.\nFacebook says it will be deleted. If you opted out of the service before this, or never opted in, or deleted your account, Facebook has said the faceprint would not be retained.\nFacebook has previously said that the only person who could access the faceprint was the account user, and a spokesperson confirmed there had been no other access to the faceprint information.\nThe spokesperson said Meta believes there are \u201ca number of potentially positive use cases for facial recognition in the future\u201d and it\u2019s something the company will explore, but privacy, control and transparency will be front of mind.\n\u201cFor each potential future application, we\u2019ll continue to be public about its intended use, how people can have control over these systems and their personal data, and how we\u2019re ensuring the technology lives up to our responsible innovation framework,\u201d he said.\nMeta is shifting its focus to creating the metaverse, and trying a whole bunch of new things at the same time as it battles against an increasingly negative public image in the past few months.",

The changes mean that everyone will be losing hundreds of pounds in earnings each month, with those who live the closest to and furthest from our sites losing significantly more with the new mileage proposals.\n\u201cThe bumbling way Mitie have handed this and their poor communication to employees is just shocking,\u201d the worker said.\nThe latest cuts come after fellow mobile test-and-trace operator G4S cut the pay of some workers by up to 5% in the light of a new government contract that specifies they should receive the real living wage.\nSome G4S workers were told their hourly pay rate would drop from \u00a310 to a maximum of \u00a39.50 outside London, a cut of 5%. Those in London will drop from a maximum \u00a311 an hour to \u00a310.85, a 1.4% cut.\nMitie said there were no standard shift timings for mobile-testing units and the hours could change depending on a range of factors including location and weather.\nIt said workers would be paid for the time from when the mobile unit left its base location until it returned. They will also now receive payment towards travel expenses \u2013 of 45p per mile from the testing base \u2013 as well as expenses such as parking fees as set out by the government. It said that previously these costs were factored into the workers\u2019 daily rate.\nA Mitie spokesperson, said: \u201cWe are introducing new procedures to ensure a consistent and fair approach to the payment terms for all colleagues working at mobile-testing units.\n\u201cThese changes better reflect the average shift length while still ensuring that colleagues are paid for any additional time they work, as well as for their business mileage and other associated driving expenses.\u201d\nMitie said it had been directed to pay travel expenses by the government.\nThe UK Health Security Agency, which was set up this year to replace Public Health England in the handling of public health protection and dealing with infectious diseases, is understood to be reviewing its position on travel expenses and the terms of payments have yet to be agreed with all operators.\nG4S did not respond directly when asked if it was planning to pay travel expenses for its workers.\nA spokesperson said: \u201cThe terms and conditions of our team members will remain in accordance with government guidelines and our contractual requirements, as it has been at all times throughout the delivery of this important contract.\u201d",

How and why he lost his life remains a mystery that has never been solved.\n\u201cKendrick went missing: nobody searched for him,\u201d his mother, Jacqueline Johnson, says to the Guardian by phone from Valdosta, Georgia. \u201cNobody called a US marshal or the FBI for him. Nobody called all those people in. They didn\u2019t put it all over the news. They didn\u2019t do none of it.\n\u201cYou see the imbalance right there. If a Black person goes missing it\u2019s just like they don\u2019t really care. As soon she [Gabby Petito] goes missing, because of her colour, she gets all the media, all the shows, everything. Everywhere you see Ms Petito. Nobody else matters.\u201d\nLocal and state authorities ruled 17-year-old Kendrick\u2019s death a freak accident, concluding that he got stuck in the middle of the mat while reaching for a gym shoe and was unable to breathe. Jacqueline and her husband Kenneth insist that he was murdered, accuse law enforcement and school officials of a cover-up and continue to wage a campaign for the truth.\nThe case is the subject of a new documentary, Finding Kendrick Johnson, based on a four-year undercover investigation into a tangled web of allegations, new evidence and alarming questions over authorities\u2019 handling of the tragedy. With didactic narration by actor and activist Jenifer Lewis, the film demands that attention must be paid.\nKendrick was a sports-loving teenager. Jacqueline, 49, recalls: \u201cHe was the baby of our family. He was just like the funniest person ever. He played three sports all the way up through high school: he played football and basketball and he ran track. Football was his passion in life. Older kids looked up to him because he would say, \u2018Yeah, one day I\u2019m going to make it in football. Y\u2019all going to see.\u2019\u201d\nThe bright shard of memory darkens. \u201cThey just took his dream away and they took our goal away because that was our goal for him. He loved football. I would say two or three years old, he was out there playing football with his dad and brothers, and then when he was old enough to get on the field, he was playing football ever since he was four years old.\u201d\nWhen she thinks of Kendrick now, Jacqueline says, \u201cit\u2019s so much hurt, so much pain. We can\u2019t even really begin to grieve or mourn because of the fight we\u2019ve had to endure.\u201d\nFellow students found Kendrick\u2019s body in the gymnasium at Lowndes high school in Valdosta \u2013 a town in the deep south where Confederate monuments still stand - at around 10.30am on 11 January 2013. Kendrick was 5ft 10in; the rolled up mat is 6ft tall. The mat was propped upright against a wall next to the gym bleachers.\nSheriff\u2019s investigators closed the case four months later, concluding that Kendrick died in a bizarre accident while reaching for a shoe inside one of the mats. A state medical examiner ruled the cause of death was \u201cpositional asphyxia\u201d, meaning the teenager got stuck upside down in a position that left him unable to breathe.\nBut Kendrick\u2019s family were left with many unanswered questions. There were strange gaps in surveillance footage from the gym. The county coroner was not called to the scene until six hours after Johnson\u2019s body was found; under Georgia law he should have been notified immediately.\nThe family secured a judge\u2019s order to exhume the body so that a second autopsy could be performed. A private pathologist found haemorrhaging beneath the skin of Johnson\u2019s jaw and neck and concluded he suffered a fatal blow near his carotid artery that appeared to be \u201cnon-accidental\u201d.\nThe second autopsy made another shocking discovery: Kendrick\u2019s internal organs were missing and paper had been stuffed into the cavities (the fate of the organs remains unknown).\nIn October 2013 a federal criminal civil rights investigation was announced, leading to interviews with almost a hundred people, but the justice department closed the case in June 2016, saying investigators \u201cfound insufficient evidence to support federal criminal charges\u201d.\nThe Johnson family also pursued various civil lawsuits without success; they were even countersued and face potential legal costs of hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\u201cMy whole family is hurt because they treated us like we\u2019re the ones who have committed a crime and instead we\u2019re the victims,\u201d Jacquelyn reflects. \u201cWe\u2019re Kendrick\u2019s mother and father and family and friends, and they treated us like we\u2019ve committed a crime. It\u2019s hurtful and it\u2019s so wrong on so many levels.\u201d\nBrian and Branden Bell, white classmates of Kendrick, were reportedly considered persons of interest in the FBI investigation. The brothers were never charged and an FBI video analysis determined they were in different parts of the school when Kendrick went to the gym. (Their father, Rick Bell, was an FBI agent who resigned after his house was raided for evidence.)\nThe brothers told investigators and the media that they did not see Kendrick on the day of his death. But the documentary dug up surveillance footage showing Kendrick standing about four feet from Brian Bell in a school hallway, as well as an unredacted FBI report that states: \u201cKendrick Johnson is observed in a covered walkway moving towards the camera. Bell is observed in the same location at this time.\u201d\nThe Bell brothers deny any wrongdoing.\nThe film\u2019s writer director, Jason Pollock, first met Jacquelyn when he was living in Ferguson, Missouri, during the uprising that followed the death of Michael Brown, a Black teenager fatally shot in 2014 by a white police officer (the subject of his film Stranger Fruit). After becoming Facebook friends with Jacquelyn, Pollock noticed graphic pictures of Kendrick\u2019s mutilated face cropping up daily in his feed.\nAs the film highlights, Jacquelyn\u2019s willingness to share the harrowing image of her son evokes Emmett Till, a 14-year-old Black boy lynched in Mississippi in 1955, whose mother decided to have an open casket so the world could see what had been done to him. The killers were never brought to justice but the searing image was galvanising for the civil rights movement.\nJacquelyn believes that someone first posted the image with malicious intent. \u201cI would never have shared no photo of him looking the way he looked \u2013 as a mother, it hurts me that you would see that picture \u2013 but I began to share that and remind the people this is what they did to my child.\u201d\nMoved and incensed, Pollock went on to spend four years researching Kendrick\u2019s death, determined to show that it is a burning injustice long overdue a fresh look. \u201cIf a white kid had been rolled up in the gym that day, I wouldn\u2019t have had to do this,\u201d he says by phone from California.\n\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t even be talking right now because the system would have done its job and the system didn\u2019t do its job from day one. They wanted to make this look like it was an accident because they didn\u2019t want to do an investigation.\u201d\nPollock continues: \u201cThe whole story is just Shakespearean, what they\u2019re going through, watching the state abuse them like this. The film doesn\u2019t come to a conclusion. We\u2019re not trying to support any conspiracy theories but we\u2019re just trying to show the facts that we\u2019re giving the light of day.\n\u201cI hope this piece of art puts a human face on the trauma as well as just gets the story out there. We don\u2019t know what happened. But this is a story we should be talking about because I do believe he is our generation\u2019s Emmett Till.\u201d\nThe director, who started his career working for the documentarian Michael Moore, has become a fierce advocate for the family. \u201cWe are calling on President Biden and his team to review the malpractice at the FBI and the DoJ with the Kendrick Johnson case and unless Washington DC starts looking at this case, the state of Georgia is never going to deal with this.\n\u201cIf you want to clean up the act of our nation, you need to clean up this case because this is a really, really, really bad one and this family deserves way more from America than they\u2019ve gotten. If you care about Black Lives Matter issues, you need to take the Kendrick Johnson case on in Washington and deal with this.\u201d\nFinding Kendrick Johnson opens with whistleblower Mitch Credle, a 23-year veteran homicide detective with Washington police who investigated Johnson\u2019s death with the US attorney\u2019s office. He says by phone: \u201cI hope the film will wake up law enforcement as far as wanting to look at it again. What bothers me at this point is: who will look into it?\n\u201cNo one\u2019s going to really trust the local jurisdiction there to look into it because of, I guess, the bad feelings, the history. The federal government were recused from the situation. So I don\u2019t know who they will get to come in and look at it and just go based on the facts.\n\u201cDon\u2019t do it with any villains involved. Just go and investigate it based on the evidence, regardless of who the suspects are. Just start from A and investigate it the proper way. All the families ask for is just do things the proper way. That\u2019s all they want.\u201d\nEarlier this year Ashley Paulk, a county sheriff in Georgia, reopened the investigation into Kendrick\u2019s death, saying he was reviewing 17 boxes of evidence collected by federal agents that his office obtained from the US justice department.\nJacqueline is sceptical of that effort but says: \u201cI remain hopeful. I\u2019m going to stay hopeful and I\u2019m going to stay prayerful that one day the truth will come out.\u201d\nThe memory of Kendrick is with her constantly. But so is the manner of his death. If \u201cclosure\u201d, whatever that means, is even possible, it still eludes her. \u201cThere\u2019s no days of not thinking about him and the things that happened to him and how can people be so evil? This is eight years\u2019 worth of pain and it is\u2019s growing stronger and stronger every day. They say it gets easier, but it don\u2019t.\u201d\nFinding Kendrick Johnson is available to rent now in the US with a UK date to be announced",

This is why we see this as an opportunity to bring a trusted and secure experience for our customers,\u201d Comyn said.\nDr Dimitrios Salampasis, a lecturer of fintech leadership and entrepreneurship at Swinburne Business School, said he was not surprised CBA had entered the cryptocurrency field.\nHe said the bank was trying to get first mover advantage in Australia, and hoped it would bring more legitimacy to the cryptocurrency space.\n\u201cHaving this coming from a systemic and the biggest bank in Australia, it\u2019s definitely a move that will change a lot,\u201d he said.\n\u201cAnd it will hopefully bring legitimacy, bring further harmonisation, push further regulation and also minimise debanking, which has been a massive pain for all cryptocurrency startups in particular.\u201d\nDebanking is where financial institutions refuse to offer services to businesses in Australia.\nA Senate select committee report on fintech services in Australia, tabled this month, cited several cryto businesses that had been rejected by dozens of financial institutions in Australia, such as the exchange Bitcoin Babe.\nThe committee, chaired by Liberal senator Andrew Bragg, recommended the government regulate the sector to allow it to fully operate in Australia, including a market licensing regime for digital currency exchanges, and for the government to develop a clear process for businesses to deal with debanking.\nSalampasis said the committee\u2019s report, along with CBA\u2019s gradual move into the sector, would likely foster regulation of cryptocurrency in Australia.\n\u201cThere has to be regulation, there has to be provisions, especially in relation to custody, especially in relation to licensing,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI do believe that Australia has a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to become a leader in the space and really drive a complete regulatory framework around cryptocurrencies.\u201d\nBragg welcomed the announcement from CBA.\n\u201cFor too long, banks have cast aside cryptocurrency as an illegitimate fringe pursuit. I am pleased the tide is turning, as digital assets are mainstreamed,\u201d he said.\n\u201cNow banks are adopting cryptocurrency, they should stop \u2018debanking\u2019 hardworking Australians.\u201d\nCBA told the committee that it \u201cdoes not have a policy\u201d around debanking due to \u201ccompetitive or market factors\u201d but when making a decision on lending to new customers, \u201cwe take a range of risk considerations into account including the terms and conditions of any loan documentation and possible security provisions provided.\u201d",

I am part of the Dolgan community: we are an indigenous Russian group and there are around 6,000 left of us living in the tundra. Growing up, the Soviet Union tried to deny us our traditional way of life, but since then climate change has become the biggest challenge to our survival.\nOur community lives by hunting, fishing and herding deer. Scientists say that Taymyr has the most rapid temperature increase in Russia, and we can really feel it.\nBecause of the warmer winters, we have seen that deer are giving birth earlier in the year. Many are born too weak and don\u2019t survive the long journeys they have to make. This means there is much less deer for us to hunt and it hurts the whole ecosystem.\nRivers and lakes that we use for fishing have also started to dry out. Others are too polluted after all the big oil and gas plants have sprung up over the years in our lands. Some days we don\u2019t catch any fish at all.\nFor generations, we have sold the food we caught to local towns and cities to buy basic products like sugar and wheat. Without animals, we cannot survive.\nBig craters are also forming because the Arctic permafrost is starting to melt under our feet. This means the routes that we have used for decades to travel, hunt and fish have to be adjusted as whole roads have sunk. It is also dangerous as you never know where the next crater will form.\nOur ecosystem is changing quickly: animals such as sables that I have never seen before in my life have appeared in the tundra. And now we also have to deal with giant mosquitoes and bugs that attack our livestock. The summers are becoming unbearable. It\u2019s madness.\nThe youth sees that climate change makes our traditional way of life impossible and they are forced to move to the bigger cities to find jobs, which are often low-paid. Our culture is disappearing.",

Reports suggested more than 2,000 law enforcement agencies across the globe had been using Clearview\u2019s services in early 2020.\nIn response to the scandal, the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) launched an investigation in cooperation with the UK\u2019s information commissioner office in July 2020.\nMark Love, a lawyer for BAL Lawyers acting for Clearview AI, said the company had gone to \u201cconsiderable lengths\u201d to cooperate, and claimed \u201cthe commissioner has not correctly understood how Clearview AI conducts it business\u201d.\nHe said Clearview AI intends to appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.\n\u201cClearview AI operates legitimately according to the laws of its places of business,\u201d he said.\n\u201cNot only has the commissioner\u2019s decision missed the mark on the manner of Clearview AI\u2019s manner of operation, the commissioner lacks jurisdiction.\u201d\nThe Australian founder and CEO of Clearview AI, Hoan Ton-That, said he respects the effort the commissioner put into evaluating the technology he built but said he is \u201cdisheartened by the misinterpretation of its value to society\u201d.\nIn its response to the OAIC, Clearview AI argued its images were collected from the internet without requiring a password or other security clearance. The company also said the images held by Clearview AI were published in the US, not Australia, so Australian privacy law should not apply.\nThe OAIC report noted Clearview AI has not offered services to Australian organisations since March 2020, but the commissioner said that didn\u2019t go far enough and all images of people in Australia must be removed.\nPolice forces in Australia have downplayed their use of the service, and the OAIC\u2019s investigation found Clearview did not have any paid customers in Australia. However, the OAIC report found officers in Australia had successfully searched for suspects, victims and themselves in the Clearview databases.\nThe OAIC is still finalising a report on the AFP\u2019s trial of the technology and whether it complied with the federal privacy code for government agencies.\nThe ABC reported last year through documents obtained under freedom of information law that at least one officer tested the software using photos of herself and another member of staff, while the Australian Centre to Counter Child Exploitation conducted searches for five \u201cpersons of interest\u201d.\nThe UK\u2019s ICO is separately considering its next steps and any formal regulatory action under the UK\u2019s data protection laws.\nIt is the second ruling the OAIC has made against facial recognition technology this year, after a similar finding was made against convenience store giant 7-Eleven last month over the collection of facial images of people filling out customer surveys across 700 stores, in a bid to weed out fake responses.\nFacebook this week also announced a move away from the use of facial recognition technology on its platform, citing concerns over privacy and transparency around the use of the technology.",

Official figures from the Office for National Statistics based on mortgage completions put the average price at \u00a3264,000 in August, while the Halifax building society suggested the milestone was passed in October 2020.\nNationwide said house prices increased by 0.7% in October this year from a month earlier, meaning the price of the average property has gone up by more than \u00a330,000 since the coronavirus pandemic began in March 2020.\nMeanwhile, year-on-year property price inflation remained at the high level of 9.9% last month, only just below the 10% level recorded in September.\nThe threshold for paying stamp duty was lowered from \u00a3500,000 to \u00a3250,000 in July, before the tax break came to an end in September.\n\u201cDemand for homes has remained strong despite the expiry of the stamp duty holiday at the end of September,\u201d said Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u2019s chief economist. \u201cCombined with a lack of homes on the market, this helps to explain why price growth has remained robust.\u201d\nThere had been expectations that demand for house purchases would slow after the threshold for paying stamp duty was lowered from \u00a3500,000 to \u00a3250,000 in July, and the tax break then came to an end in September.\nHowever, it is unclear whether house prices will continue to rise in the coming months and Gardner called the outlook for the housing market \u201cextremely uncertain\u201d.\nFurther property price inflation is dependent on a range of factors, including interest rates, consumer confidence and employment levels after the end of government pandemic support measures including the furlough scheme.\n\u201cIf the labour market remains resilient, conditions may stay fairly buoyant in the coming months \u2013 especially as the market continues to have momentum and there is scope for ongoing shifts in housing preferences as a result of the pandemic to continue to support activity,\u201d Gardner said, adding that interest rate rises could cool the market.\nThe Bank of England will reveal its latest interest rate decision on Thursday. Financial markets are betting on a rate rise, as a result of rising inflation, although most City economists expect rates to remain at record lows for the moment.\nAny rate rises over the coming months are forecast to be gradual and are not expected to have a strong impact on UK borrowers.",

At stake is a chance to put the brakes on an arms race between the US, Russia and China \u2013 or the risk of that race accelerating.\nDespite Biden\u2019s pledge during the campaign \u2013 and in his interim national security guidance issued in March \u2013 that his administration would reduce \u201cour reliance and excessive expenditure on nuclear weapons\u201d, hawks at the Pentagon have won the early skirmishes.\nBiden is also under pressure from some allies, nervous about Biden\u2019s past support for limiting the use of nuclear weapons to the \u201csole purpose\u201d of deterring, and retaliating against, a nuclear attack on the US or its allies.\nThe current US posture is broader, leaving open a nuclear response to \u201csignificant non-nuclear strategic attacks\u201d. Britain and France also retain a certain amount of ambiguity about when they would use their weapons, and are concerned a US change to \u201csole purpose\u201d would oblige them ultimately to narrow their options. Paris has taken the lead in conveying those anxieties, and Emmanuel Macron raised nuclear posture issues with Biden when the two met in Rome on Friday.\nThe big struggle, however, is on the home front, where arms control advocates are on the defensive.\nThe administration\u2019s first defence budget in February included $43bn for an array of nuclear modernisation schemes, including controversial programmes introduced by Donald Trump, like a new sea-launched cruise missile. The total cost of modernisation could be over $1.5tn.\nIn September, one of Biden\u2019s political appointees at the Pentagon, Leonor Tomero, who questioned the need for such a vast and growing nuclear weapons budget, was forced out in a bureaucratic power struggle after just nine months in the post. Her job had been to oversee the drafting of the NPR, which sets out what nuclear weapons the US should have and under what conditions they could be used.\nThe official reason for Tomero\u2019s departure was that her job as deputy assistant secretary for nuclear and missile defense policy had disappeared as part of efforts to streamline the Pentagon bureaucracy.\n\u201cThis transition of her duties is the result of a reorganization decision designed to more appropriately align the policy\u2019s shop structure with policy objectives,\u201d John Kirby, the Pentagon spokesman, said. \u201cThe nuclear posture review continues and is being handled by a large group of experts from across the department under the purview of the under secretary for policy.\u201d\nBut several congressional sources said that her departure came after pressure from a Republican hardliner, Senator Deb Fischer of Nebraska, a staunch supporter of the nuclear weapons establishment, who threatened to hold up confirmations of senior Biden nominees if Tomero was not removed.\nSenator Fischer\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment. A Pentagon spokesman said: \u201cI don\u2019t have any information to provide on this, but generally we cannot comment on personal discussions between department leadership and members of Congress.\u201d\n\u201cIt seems like the minute she got there she was under attack from people who were working behind the scenes, with congressional Republicans, to put pressure on senior Pentagon officials to get rid of Leonor,\u201d said Jeffrey Lewis, an expert in nuclear non-proliferation and geopolitics at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey. \u201cThis is all about making progressive views on nuclear weapons unacceptable.\u201d\nSenator Edward Markey, a Democrat, has written to Biden demanding to know why Tomero had been removed in the midst of drafting the NPR, demanding to know if \u201cideology played any role\u201d.\nArms control advocates complain the Democrats have not been as ruthless as Republicans in pursuit of their policies. A Trump appointee, Drew Walter, a former senior Republican staffer on the House armed services committee, has been allowed to \u201cburrow in\u201d as deputy assistant secretary for nuclear matters, converting from a political appointee to a career official. Tomero was Walter\u2019s Democratic counterpart when they were in Congress, but the Biden administration failed to protect her once she moved to the Pentagon.\nNickolas Roth, the director of the nuclear security programme at the Stimson Center thinktank, said: \u201cI am concerned that the removal of Leonor from her position will have a chilling effect throughout the Biden administration, on those who might be willing to propose anything other than the status quo for US nuclear weapons policy.\u201d\nThe deputy national security adviser, Jonathan Finer, played down concerns that conservatives in the Pentagon would be able to shape the NPR.\n\u201cThis is going to be the president\u2019s posture review and the president\u2019s policy,\u201d Finer insisted at a Ploughshares Fund event last month. \u201cHe has asked the Pentagon, as has been the tradition in the past, to take the lead on drafting the posture review \u2026 but by the time we get to the end, it will be the president\u2019s document.\u201d\nWith that in mind, Democrats have been reminding Biden that every dollar spent on weapons programmes inherited from his predecessors is a dollar less spent on the social aspirations of the administration.\n\u201cThe administration must harness this opportunity to rethink the status quo and not just rubber-stamp the Pentagon and defense industry\u2019s interest in continuing unnecessary weapons,\u201d Senator Jeff Merkley told the Guardian. \u201cBusiness as usual risks fuelling an unnecessary arms race and squanders billions of dollars that could go towards improving Americans\u2019 health, education and housing costs or better investments in national security.\u201d\nThe White House has sought to placate Democrats by agreeing to an independent review of the feasibility of extending the life of the current Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile, compared with replacing with it a new weapon, the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD). The review is expected to deliver its conclusions next year, although as the review panel has been selected by the Pentagon, it is not expected to upset plans to go ahead with the $100bn GBSD.\nChina\u2019s nuclear weapons development, including the recent reported testing of a nuclear-capable hypersonic glider launched from orbit, has increased the political pressure on Biden to abandon his arms control pledges, although the Chinese arsenal is still dwarfed by the US total of 3,750 warheads.\nEmma Belcher, the president of the Ploughshares Fund, an arms control advocacy organisation, argued that China\u2019s rise as a nuclear weapons power only underlines the urgency of arms control.\n\u201cThe best way to control the situation and head off an arms race with China is through diplomacy and restraint,\u201d Belcher said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen this movie before. It\u2019s expensive and dangerous. So what we\u2019re hoping we\u2019ll see from the NPR is for diplomacy to be put first, and an off ramp from a new kind of cold war.\u201d",

        "content": "We have never been more reliant on the internet \u2013 yet Pamela Paul still gets DVDs in the post and buys CD players. Why? Because we have lost more to the digital era than we realise, she says\nPamela Paul must be one of the last subscribers to the branch of Netflix that allows its users to see films via the stone-age practice of receiving DVDs in the post. I know this because, two days after we talk, she sends me a blurry photograph of her last hire \u2013 The Anniversary Party, a 2001 comedy starring Gwyneth Paltrow, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Alan Cumming \u2013 along with a Q&A she did for the New York Times, about the art of what she calls \u201csliding backward on tech\u201d. Its basic point is summarised in one of Paul\u2019s characteristic bits of aphoristic wisdom: \u201cIn general, when I hear the phrase \u2018There\u2019s an app for that\u2019, my first question is: \u2018Does there need to be?\u2019\u201d\nPaul, 50, is the editor of the New York Times Book Review. She does not use any streaming services. As late as 2019, she bought \u2013 read this slowly \u2013 portable CD players for two of her children. As a matter of principle, she refuses to own or use anything resembling a tablet, except her phone. \u201cI don\u2019t want a tablet,\u201d she says, her face adopting an expression of mild disgust. \u201cPeople have tried to give me a tablet; I want nothing to do with that tablet. I would probably have to be paid a salary of, like, $250,000 a year to use a Kindle or an iPad to read on. It would be that unpleasant.\u201d\nThis is not quite the expression of luddite fundamentalism it might seem. Paul\u2019s professional life is just as tech-heavy as most other people\u2019s. She says her working hours are \u201ca cascade of Zooms\u201d, while her fairly prolific tweeting is not suggestive of someone who lives in a cave. But she does maintain a personal existence partly rooted in the pre-internet age. Moreover, she is old enough \u2013 like me \u2013 to recall clearly what life was like in those far-off times, and to feel a nagging sense of loss about what the online world has rendered useless and irrelevant.\nThis is the context for her latest book, 100 Things We\u2019ve Lost to the Internet. Its form seems to fit an era of short attention spans, breaking up its author\u2019s writing into short essays with headings such as \u201cSolitude\u201d, \u201cIgnoring people\u201d, \u201cLeaving a message\u201d and \u201cA parent\u2019s undivided attention\u201d. At its best, the book reads like it mixes journalism with sociology and anthropology. To its credit, it also manages the rare feat of exploring what technology has done to us without succumbing to doom and panic.\nWe talk for an hour on a video call and one thing quickly becomes clear: Paul is the kind of freewheeling conversationalist who was always going to feel a little adrift in a world of one-line texts, emojis and the disappearance of the long, digressive phone conversation. \u201cThere are a lot of terrible things to say about the internet,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat I wanted to focus on was not so much all of those doomsday scenarios, although they exist, but to look at all of these forces and say: \u2018What does this mean for what we do in our daily lives \u2013 from the moment we wake up to the iPhone alarm to the moment when we\u2019re trying to fall asleep at night and we can\u2019t because we\u2019re like: \u2018Oh my God, there\u2019s this newsletter that arrives at 11pm, let me just see what it says\u2019? What does it actually mean down here at the level of how we live?\u201d\nPaul has been an author for nearly 20 years, specialising in what she calls \u201cthe intersection of consumer culture and real life\u201d. Her first book, published in 2002, was about what she called \u201cstarter marriages\u201d \u2013 the trend for many people\u2019s first experience of matrimony to be short and childless \u2013 and how this was partly traceable to the massive wedding industry. Three years later came a prescient work titled Pornified, which focused on one of the internet\u2019s most pernicious aspects; it was subtitled \u201cHow pornography is transforming our lives, our relationships and our families\u201d. Parenting Inc, from 2008, was about the consumerisation of raising kids. By way of offering an antidote of some kind, her 2019 book How To Raise a Reader \u2013 written with her NYT colleague Maria Russo \u2013 was a straightforward guide to pulling children away from screens and encouraging the declining habit of getting immersed in books.\n100 Things draws on themes that have run through a lot of her work. It applies an appealing humour and light touch, and tells a vivid story: how, in little more than 20 years, we have shed ingrained social and behavioural habits, as well as some of the most basic ways we once thought of ourselves and our relationships with others. If they are minded to read it, anyone under 40 will presumably understand the book as the evocation of a strange, slow, endlessly inconvenient reality that now feels almost exotic. For anyone older, it will deliver a sense of loss \u2013 and of being old enough to remember times that seem almost hilariously distant.\nOne of Paul\u2019s talents is the ability to see big change in lots of small ones. She writes about the end of talking to strangers on aeroplanes; the increasingly lost human habit of staring out of windows; and why no one bothers to remember phone numbers any more.\nIn one particularly ingenious entry, she explains the demise of the full stop (or, in American English, the \u201cperiod\u201d). If you have ever wondered why putting such once-crucial punctation in emails, phone messages or tweets now feels so awkward, here is the answer: \u201cThe period can feel so emphatic as to sound sarcastic, the internet\u2019s version of \u2018puh-leeze\u2019 and \u2018no, thank you\u2019 and \u2018srsly\u2019 rolled into one tiny dot.\u201d It can easily come across as passive-aggressive. Exclamation marks, moreover, \u201cnow convey warmth and sincerity\u201d; failing to use them runs the risk of making the person you are messaging feel uncertain and anxious.\nSuch small transformations, Paul explains, arrive without warning and magnify a sense of everything being in flux. For fear of becoming social outcasts, most people feel they have little option but to try frantically to keep up.\nOn the day we speak, Mark Zuckerberg has just announced the rebranding of Facebook\u2019s holding company as Meta and premiered the virtual reality hellscape the company is calling the metaverse. \u201cWe are all desperately trying to stay on top of things,\u201d says Paul. \u201cRight now, we\u2019re going to have to be on top of the metaverse or we\u2019ll have to opt out of it altogether. But we\u2019re constantly moving forward: \u2018Should I do this thing? How come I don\u2019t know about that app? I haven\u2019t adopted it.\u2019\n\u201cWhat we never do is take a step back and say: \u2018Wait a minute \u2013 what did we use to do here? How did this use to work?\u2019 And what\u2019s crazy is we\u2019ve become so quickly habituated. We\u2019ve adopted all these new habits and completely forgotten how we used to get around \u2013 literally, how we used to get around. How did we do it when we didn\u2019t have GPS? Oh yeah, we used to have those huge fold-out maps that you could never fold back properly. But we\u2019ve forgotten that. No one uses those any more. And no one knows how to get anywhere without a device.\u201d\nRecently, she read a century-old book by the US novelist Edith Wharton, A Motor-Flight Through France, which was written partly as an exploration of how much human existence had been changed by the invention of the car. \u201cThat was occasion enough to write an entirely new travelogue about a country she\u2019d written about before \u2013 because suddenly you were no longer beholden to trains and so you could go down different routes and you didn\u2019t have to rely on a schedule. And now, you just think about the tininess of that change, really, relative to the ways in which everything has altered in the last 20 years. That was considered to be a monumental shift. But it\u2019s nothing compared with what we\u2019ve been through in the last 20 years.\u201d\nA key part of the internet\u2019s behavioural and psychological revolution is the subject of the book\u2019s opening entry: boredom, the decline of which has radically altered childhood (as any parent will know). \u201cOnly a few short decades ago, during the lost age of underparenting, grownups thought a certain amount of boredom was appropriate, even to be encouraged, because it forced kids to exercise their imagination and ingenuity,\u201d Paul writes. \u201cA little ennui would make a person less bored in the long run.\u201d\n\u201cBoredom serves a function,\u201d she says now. \u201cIt\u2019s boring, obviously, and we don\u2019t like that, but, when you have no input coming in, you generate output. That\u2019s how you become resourceful. But now you constantly have access to information, entertainment, distraction \u2013 all of this stuff coming in, coming in and coming in. And it doesn\u2019t allow you the empty space to create something, or to just process something.\n\u201cI spent so much time in the back seat of my parents\u2019 car bored out of my skull. There was nothing to do. Then your brain wanders and you think about things. Now, every kid in the car has their own device and they\u2019re listening to their own music or their own audiobook or their own podcasts, or they\u2019re playing a video game or they\u2019re swiping through social media, or they\u2019re taking a million and one pictures of themselves and snapping them up to Snapchat. I don\u2019t know why. How many times can you look at people\u2019s faces?\u201d\nIn a roundabout way, this brings us to something that the book explores a lot: the sense that most of us live in front of a constant audience, with few benefits to show for it. \u201cI feel like what\u2019s happened is that everyone is living the emotional lives of famous people, constantly needing to react to this world that is so much larger than the actual human world that they otherwise would be inhabiting. And I think that is really emotionally and psychologically hard to handle, in the same way that it\u2019s hard to handle for a celebrity. They\u2019re lucky that they get to be rich and probably beautiful on top of that and have lots of privileges. But most of us, frankly, don\u2019t.\u201d\nPaul\u2019s book is not quite the endless lament our conversation suggests. Some of its entries are full of ambivalence: being able to \u201cGoogle the hell out of someone\u201d in advance of a blind date might rob the occasion of its mystery, but it is surely all to the good; the modern impossibility of getting lost might sometimes mean that we don\u2019t \u201csuccumb to chance and make our own discoveries\u201d, but it has its upsides. There is also material about things surely no one will miss: chequebooks, old-school encyclopedias, the Filofax (note to younger readers: ask your parents).\nNonetheless, her most poignant, thought-provoking points are about things we should not throw overboard with the enthusiasm that the tech industry wants us to \u2013 and, by implication, about the necessity of what she calls \u201cmicrorebellions\u201d. Besides her CD players and rented DVDs, there is another obvious example.\n\u201cWell, look here,\u201d she says. She pulls her computer to her left and my screen is filled with the image of thousands of books.\nShe thinks for a moment. \u201cDo you know what the way I think about all this is? I am highly technological in my day job, because I have to be. And then, in my personal life, rather than the default being opt-in, my default is opting out. I will only adopt something if I really think it\u2019s going to improve my life in some substantial way.\u201d\nHere, perhaps, is a modern paradox. We embrace the internet because it seems to hugely increase our autonomy, but the online world soon gives us the sense that, when it comes to what it offers us, we have no meaningful choices at all. The only thing to do is to drop the old, embrace the new and live with the consequences.\n\u201cWe have the option to say: I don\u2019t want that product,\u201d says Paul. \u201cI don\u2019t actually have to pay by [the mobile payment service] Venmo. I don\u2019t need PayPal. I don\u2019t have to get my books from an online retailer. There are other ways of doing these things. It\u2019s a choice. Buying or not buying a pair of jeans or a new skin cream \u2013 those are all options, too. And yet, for some reason, with technology, we forget that we have control.\u201d\n100 Things We\u2019ve Lost to the Internet by Pamela Paul (Random House USA, \u00a314.99) is out now.

        "content": "PCs Deniz Jaffer and Jamie Lewis admit misconduct over images shared on WhatsApp\nA police officer made degrading and sexist insults about two murdered women as he shared pictures from the scene where they were found with a colleague photographing their bodies and also sharing the images via WhatsApp.\nThe two Metropolitan police officers pleaded guilty on Tuesday after sharing photographs from the crime scene they were supposed to be guarding in a London park, where two sisters, Nicole Smallman, 27, and Bibaa Henry, 46, were found stabbed to death.\nPC Deniz Jaffer, 48, and PC Jamie Lewis, 33, admitted misconduct in public office at the Old Bailey, with the judge, Mark Lucraft QC, warning that they were \u201cextremely likely\u201d to be jailed.\nJaffer left the post he had been assigned to in June 2020 at Fryent Country Park in Wembley, north-west London, and went into bushes where the women had been left by their satanist-obsessed killer. The officer took out a mobile phone and took pictures of the bodies.\nHe sent four images to Lewis, who edited one of the photos and superimposed his face on to it with the two murdered women visible in the background. Lewis took other photos from the crime scene, which did not show the victims, and shared them with a group of more than 40 officers via WhatsApp who called themselves the \u201cA-team\u201d.\nThe Independent Office for Police Conduct said Lewis had \u201cused degrading and sexist language to describe the victims\u201d. A spokesperson confirmed the remarks were directed at the murder victims and it was fair to characterise the remarks as insulting.\nHenry, a senior social worker, and Smallman, a photographer, had been celebrating the elder sister\u2019s birthday in the park. After the celebration ended, they stayed behind and were attacked. They were reported missing the next day and a search by family and friends led to the partner of one of the sisters finding their bodies.\nThe family of the murdered women were last week backed by the police watchdog in their claims the Met had let them down when the force failed to search for the two sisters after they went missing.\nThe scandal, first revealed by the Guardian, has further blighted the Met\u2019s reputation and the guilty pleas meant more detail about the officers\u2019s actions were finally revealed.\nOn Tuesday, the women\u2019s mother, Mina Smallman, said the Met was \u201cbeyond hope\u201d and called for its leaders to \u201cget the rot out once and for all\u201d. She accused the Met commissioner, Cressida Dick, of a \u201cshoddy way of behaving\u201d. She said: \u201cShe has not contacted us to say \u2018I am really sorry\u2019. She has not spoken into this story at all. And it\u2019s shameful that the IOPC [Independent Office for Police Conduct] had to tell the Met they should apologise to us in their failings for the missing persons [investigation]. Too little, too late. Too little, too late.\n\u201cWhen I was in a senior position, if my organisation or department failed, it was on me. I had to take the can for it. Well, it\u2019s now time for them to take the can for it. They are beyond hope.\u201d\nThe Guardian understands that Jaffer was a mentor for new recruits. The Met say he resigned in August and that he and Lewis will face a fast-track process to sack them.\nJaffer, of Hornchurch in east London, and Lewis, from Colchester in Essex, were based with the Met\u2019s North East Area Command.\nThe judge told the men he viewed their offences as grave enough to merit lengthy imprisonment: \u201cThese matters are extremely serious and you should be under no illusions when you return for sentence it is extremely likely you will receive custodial sentences, custodial sentences of some length for your conduct.\u201d\nThe indictment says the offences took place between 7 June, the day the bodies were found, and 23 June 2020.\nIn a statement after the guilty pleas, the Crown Prosecution Service said: \u201cPC Lewis edited one of the pictures by superimposing his own face on to the photograph with the victims in the background. He sent the resulting image to PC Jaffer, who then forwarded it unsolicited to a female officer also present at the scene.\n\u201cPC Jaffer showed one of the photos of the victims to a male officer as they left the park. PC Lewis also shared photographs he had taken at the crime scene, which did not show the victims, with a WhatsApp group of 40-plus police officers called the A Team.\n\u201cPC Jaffer, meanwhile, sent photographs of the victims to three friends via WhatsApp.\u201d\nDick said: \u201cI deeply regret that at a time when they were grieving the loss of their loved ones who were taken in such awful circumstances, they faced additional distress caused by the actions of two police officers. What former PC Jaffer and PC Lewis chose to do that day was utterly unprofessional, disrespectful and deeply insensitive.\u201d\nThe officers will be sentenced at a later date and were granted bail.\nDanyal Hussein, who was 18 at the time, from Blackheath in south London, has been convicted of the murder of both sisters and jailed for life.\nThe IOPC said that three officers who received the images but did not report them had a case to answer for misconduct.\n This article was amended on 3 November 2021 to add a picture of Deniz Jaffer and Jamie Lewis as the main image.",

Meanwhile, unemployment has hit 34.4%.\nFrustrations with the ANC government played out in July when widespread rioting and looting erupted Zuma\u2019s imprisonment for contempt after refusing to testify in a corruption investigation. The unrest claimed at least 354 lives.\nUntil 2016, the ANC had won more than 60% at every election since South Africa\u2019s first multi-racial vote in 1994 when Nelson Mandela was sworn in as president. The party\u2019s support slipped from 62% in the 2011 municipal elections to 54% during the 2016 vote.\nRalph Mathekga, an analyst and author of books on ANC politics, said, the election could be \u201ca predictor for what is looming at the next general election.\n\u201cIf the ANC drops below 50% \u2026 South Africa will no longer be led by a hegemonic party,\u201d he said, adding that the result could threaten President Cyril Ramaphosa\u2019s position as president when the ANC elects its leader next year. But no other single party yet seems remotely ready to rival the ANC.\nThe DA has struggled to shed its image as a party of white privilege in a country that is nine-tenths non-white, while the EFF\u2019s radical rhetoric scares many voters off.\nAs well as avoiding the loss of its overall majority, the ANC hopes to win back the metropolitan areas it lost to opposition-led coalitions in the 2016 poll, including the commercial hub Johannesburg and the capital Pretoria.\nAt 18.15 GMT, results for Johannesburg from 29% of polling stations gave the ANC 37%, against 22% for the DA. The DA, meanwhile, was leading in Tshwane, which includes Pretoria, with 39% of the vote against the ANC\u2019s 29%, on results from 19% of stations.\nActionSA, the most popular newcomer party, whose leader, Herman Mashaba, has been criticised for vociferous anti-immigrant remarks, was on 1.6% nationwide, but polling 17% in Johannesburg, putting it third there.",

        "content": "With more than a third of the country\u2019s greenhouse gases coming from farming, Dublin faces huge pressure over reduction aims\nUp to 1.3 million cattle would have to be culled in Ireland to reach anticipated government targets for reducing greenhouse gases in the agriculture sector, a new report has concluded.\n  Irish farmers are expecting the worst after taoiseach Miche\u00e1l Martin described the report by KPMG, commissioned by weekly newspaper the Irish Farmers Journal, as \u201cscaremongering\u201d.\nThe debate over agriculture\u2019s role in reducing carbon emissions is a hugely controversial topic in Ireland, pitting Dublin against rural communities.\nThe country has long relied on farming, alongside multinational investment, to drive its economy. Irish beef and dairy brands such as Kerrygold and Pilgrims Choice are among its most successful exports.\nBut Irish agriculture is under huge pressure: 35% of national greenhouse gases come from the sector, the highest level in Europe, where the average is 11%. And more than 60% of that comes from methane associated with belching by ruminant animals.\n\nCows and other farm animals produce\u00a0about 14%\u00a0of human-induced climate emissions. But it is the methane component of those emissions that causes most concern.About a third of human-caused methane emissions\u00a0come from\u00a0livestock, mostly from beef and dairy cattle, produced in the digestive process that allows ruminants (hoofed animals including cows, sheep and goats with four-part stomachs) to absorb plants.Although methane breaks down relatively quickly in the atmosphere, it is a more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. Reducing these emissions has been touted as one of the most immediate opportunities to slow global heating.Options for reducing methane include\u00a0alternative feeds\u00a0for cattle, reducing food loss and waste, and cutting meat and dairy production.While the\u00a0US and EU made a\u00a0joint pledge last month\u00a0to reduce methane emissions by almost a third in the next decade, there are no specific commitments for the farming sectors.Countries are wary of being tied into specific actions, such as reducing meat production or consumption, so prefer to set emissions targets with flexibility about how they are achieved.Campaigners say the emissions targets countries, including the UK and EU, have set are not achievable without reductions in meat and dairy consumption.\nMore than 100 countries pledged to reduce methane emissions by 30% by 2030 in Glasgow on Tuesday in an initiative put forward by the US and the EU. Although methane breaks down relatively quickly in the atmosphere, it is a more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. Reducing these emissions has been touted as one of the most immediate opportunities to slow global heating.\n  Stephen Prendiville, head of sustainability at the EY consultancy in Dublin, said the debate about methane \u201chad been lost\u201d in the narrative about the climate emergency and this would help countries reliant on agriculture to focus on how to \u201coperationalise\u201d reductions.\nThe Irish government is due to unveil its sector-by-sector climate emergency plans on Thursday and is considering a 21% to 30% cut in carbon emissions from the agriculture sector.\nKPMG looked at four scenarios, concluding that rural Ireland faced a \u20ac4bn hit to the economy and the loss of more than 56,000 jobs if the government opted for the 30% target.\nIt also warned that a 30% cut would require a 20% cut in cattle numbers, 22% of the beef herd and 18% of the dairy herd.\nWith 6.5 million cattle in the country according to official Central Statistics Office data this equates to a reduction of 1.3 million of the national herd.\nThe lower target of 21% would mean a reduction of about 5%, or 325,000 cattle, according to the KPMG analysis.\n\u201cFarmers desperately hope that it doesn\u2019t come to this [culling],\u201d said Phelim O\u2019Neill, editor of the Irish Farmers Journal. \u201cThere is widespread acknowledgement that we need to reduce emissions\u201d, he said but he had commissioned the report to put some facts back into the \u201cheated debate\u201d that is giving famers \u201cclimate anxiety\u201d about their futures.\nThe debate has pitted Dublin versus rural Ireland, with farmers feeling they are being unfairly targeted without government assessments of the impact on their industry.\nThe president of the Irish Farmers\u2019 Association, Tim Cullinan, said it was \u201cextraordinary\u201d to hear the taoiseach say the report was scaremongering.\nMartin told RTE on Tuesday: \u201cI think we need to be very careful of that scaremongering,\u201d after reports that targets at the lower end of the scale would result in 10,000 fewer jobs in agriculture. \u201cFarming will have to change,\u201d he said.\nCullinan said: \u201cWe have repeatedly asked for such an exercise to be carried out by our government, but they have refused to do so. Miche\u00e1l Martin is shooting in the dark and he has no idea what the economic or social impact of these ceilings will be in rural areas.\u201d\nIreland has committed to reducing carbon emissions by 50% by 2030 with a cabinet subcommittee meeting on Wednesday to finalise the sector details.\nMartin told RTE the country had \u201cno choice\u201d and if it did not commit to the targets it would affect the country\u2019s \u201ceconomic sustainability\u201d. He also admitted that over the past decade carbon emissions in the country had increased and \u201cthat is problematic\u201d.\nThis article was amended on 4 November 2021 to remove an incorrect suggestion that Ireland does not have a significant manufacturing sector.\nSign up for the Animals farmed monthly update to get a roundup of the biggest farming and food stories across the world and keep up with our investigations.

It had shrunk to the size of an A4 piece of paper in recent weeks before finally disappearing in mild weather.\nIain Cameron, an expert in snow cover who has been studying snow patches in Scotland for 25 years, said global heating was a significant factor. \u201cHow ironic and prescient it is that our longest-lasting patch of snow melted for the third time in five years, right on the eve of Cop26. Before 2000 it had melted only three times in the last 150 years.\u201d\nAccording to records, the Sphinx previously melted fully in 1933, 1959, 1996, 2003, 2006, 2017 and 2018. Before 1933, it is thought to have last melted completely in the 1700s.\nCameron, author of the book The Vanishing Ice, said warmer weather caused by the climate crisis \u201cseemed to be the logical\u201d explanation for the increased rate of melting. \u201cWhat we are seeing from research are smaller and fewer patches of snow. Less snow is falling now in winter than in the 1980s and even the 1990s.\u201d\nThe Sphinx lies in Garbh Choire Mor, a hollow known as a corrie that was formed by ice or a glacier during the last ice age.\nA report commissioned by Cairngorms national park authority and published last year said declining snow cover had been observed on Cairngorm mountain since the winter of 1983-84. Researchers also noted a trend for increasingly warmer weather since the 1960s, and suggested that by the 2080s there would be some years with very little or no snow at all on Cairngorm.\nBefore Scotland\u2019s ski resorts were hit by coronavirus closures, they faced one of their most difficult seasons in 2019, with a lack of snow forcing many slopes to close.\nLauren McCallum, of the international climate crisis campaign group Protect Our Winters, said the Cairngorms \u2013 and wider world \u2013 needed to be protected from further rises in temperature. She said: \u201cWe have to maintain a healthy temperature for our ecosystems and communities to survive.\u201d",

        "content": "AXA1125 targets cell power plants that may be dysfunctional in long Covid patients with severe fatigue\nThe first trial of a drug to target the fatigue and muscle weakness experienced by more than half of people with long Covid has been launched in the UK. It is also the first drug trial in long Covid patients who were not hospitalised during their initial infection.\nThe drug, called AXA1125, targets cellular power plants called mitochondria, which it is thought could be dysfunctional in the subset of long Covid patients with severe fatigue. If successful, it could pave the way for similar trials in patients with other forms of post-viral fatigue, including myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS).\nMitochondria help to regulate various cellular processes, and play a crucial role in transforming the chemical energy from our diets into adenosine triphosphate (ATP) \u2013 the energy currency that cells depend on to drive essential reactions.\nSupplies of ATP are quickly exhausted, so cells must constantly regenerate it. This can be done through a process called glycolysis, which produces lactic acid as a byproduct. But ATP is produced more efficiently through oxidative phosphorylation, which involves the mitochondria.\nMounting evidence suggests Sars-CoV-2 can hijack cells\u2019 mitochondria, boosting viral replication but disrupting ATP production in the process.\n\u201cIn essence, it\u2019s a fuel switch. The virus invades the mitochondria and seeks to move it towards glycolysis to produce more viral particles, but it leaves the cell damaged,\u201d said Bill Hinshaw, the president and chief executive of Axcella, which developed the new drug.\nAn estimated 56% of long Covid patients suffer from fatigue and many also struggle to exercise. \u201cWe originally thought that these symptoms were related to organ inflammation,\u201d said Dr Betty Raman at the University of Oxford, who is researching the impact of Covid-19 on organ health. \u201cBut six months down the track, we found that although the heart and lungs were seen to be recovering, these people were still unable to exercise.\u201d\nFurther investigation revealed that they were accumulating lactic acid in their muscles at a faster rate than healthy individuals \u2013 a possible sign of mitochondrial dysfunction. \u201cIn a normal, healthy person, the mitochondria will be very active in replenishing the ATP to sustain energy,\u201d Raman said.\nAXA1125 is designed to normalise mitochondrial metabolism in diseases where it may be out of balance. So far it has been tested in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, with some promising results.\nRaman is launching a study in 40 patients with severe post-Covid fatigue to see if it can improve their exercise tolerance, reduce fatigue and improve mitochondrial metabolism in their muscle tissue \u2013 something that can be visualised using imaging techniques. Half will be given AXA1125 for 28 days, and the other half a placebo drug. Results are expected by mid-2022.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think this one drug will be the solution to everything because long Covid is such a complex disease, but [if it works] it will benefit a significant proportion of patients,\u201d Raman said.\nProf Amitava Banerjee, of University College London, who is spearheading a separate trial of long Covid diagnostics and treatments, said: \u201cIt is really good to be trialling different drugs and different mechanisms. Mitochondrial dysfunction in fatigue is something that\u2019s been written about and studied for some time, but we don\u2019t know how common it is in this patient population, or how it correlates with the severity of their symptoms.\u201d\nHe is waiting for approval to begin trials of \u201crepurposed\u201d drugs such as antihistamines and aspirin in long Covid patients who were not hospitalised. A trial to identify treatments to boost recovery after Covid-19 patients are discharged from hospital is already under way.\nBanerjee said: \u201cWhatever we\u2019re trialling, we know there\u2019s tens of thousands of people either waiting to be seen or being seen in clinics. Any new treatments need to be translatable and accessible quickly.\u201d\nIf AXA1125 does help to reduce fatigue in long Covid, there could also be important implications for people with ME/CFS, according to Dr Charles Shepherd, a medical adviser at the ME Association. \u201cWe now have a considerable amount of research evidence to indicate that there is mitochondrial dysfunction in ME/CFS, and that the effect this has on muscle energy metabolism appears to be a significant contributory factor in the activity induced-fatigue that occurs.\u201d",

This is sacrosanct in providing fairness and natural justice, and ensuring there is an opportunity to check due process and that the right procedures were followed.\u201d\nDowning Street sources confirmed that meant the prime minister was supporting an amendment tabled by the former leader of the House of Commons Andrea Leadsom that would halt Paterson\u2019s suspension.\nIt was confirmed that the amendment had been selected by the Speaker, and would thus be voted on by MPs later on Wednesday.\nThe parliamentary commissioner for standards called for the North Shropshire MP to be suspended after he committed an \u201cegregious\u201d breach of lobbying rules on behalf of two companies that were paying him more than \u00a3100,000.\nLabour\u2019s deputy leader, Angela Rayner, challenged Johnson directly over the issue at prime minister\u2019s questions, accusing him of trying to \u201cchange the rules to allow cash for access\u201d.\nStanding in for Keir Starmer, who is self-isolating with Covid, Rayner told the prime minister: \u201cIn no other profession in our country could someone be found guilty by an independent process and just have their mates vote them back into the job.\u201d\nReplying, Johnson thumped the dispatch box as he said \u201cpaid advocacy is wrong\u201d, but insisted that was \u201cnot the issue in this case\u201d.\n\u201cThe issue in this case, which involves a serious family tragedy, is whether a member of this house had a fair opportunity to make representations in this case, and whether as a matter of natural justice our procedures in this house allow for proper appeal.\u201d\nHe accused Labour of \u201cplaying politics\u201d, but Rayner said: \u201cIf it was a police officer, a teacher, a doctor, we would expect the independent process to be followed and not changed after the verdict \u2013 it\u2019s one rule for them, and one rule for the rest of us.\u201d \nPaterson was found to have broken three rules when he lobbied government on behalf of two firms: Randox, a clinical diagnostics company, and Lynn\u2019s Country Foods, a processor and distributor of meat products.\nThe former environment and Northern Ireland secretary said he was acting as a whistleblower to raise concerns with the Food Standards Agency (FSA) and Department for International Development about milk and bacon standards. However, the standards commissioner accepted that while this applied for the original communication and meeting he held, it did not to the subsequent ones.\nPaterson was found to have praised Randox\u2019s \u201csuperior technology\u201d, which the standards committee said was an attempt to \u201cconfer a benefit on Randox, to whom he was a paid consultant\u201d. Other messages sent by him to the FSA in November 2017 promoting Lynn\u2019s Country Foods were found to be potentially directly beneficial to the company.\nThe commissioner also found Paterson used his parliamentary office and meeting facilities in parliament 25 times for his work for paying clients, and that there were two letters sent on parliamentary paper. The combination of factors led to the commissioner saying Paterson\u2019s breaches \u201cwere so serious and so numerous that they risked damaging public trust\u201d in the House of Commons and in MPs generally.\nPaterson has protested his innocence and claimed 17 witnesses whom he wanted to be able to give oral evidence in his defence were not called to do so \u2013 though the committee said this was because their written evidence was sufficient, and it was not a question of what Paterson\u2019s motivations were, but simply of the fact of whether he broke the rules or not.\nDespite the last-ditch bid to save Paterson, some Tories are very uncomfortable. A minister told the Guardian they were \u201cbeing asked to do something which is cutting corners and allowing my integrity to be questioned as a result of someone else\u2019s silliness\u201d, adding that Paterson was \u201cclearly way over the line\u201d.",

        "content": "Nottingham PlayhouseGatiss\u2019s delayed rework amps up the ghostly effects while drawing out the overlooked dark comedy in the classic tale\nIf it seems premature to be staging Charles Dickens\u2019s yuletide story of restless ghosts and Christian goodwill in early November, it is worth remembering that Mark Gatiss\u2019s adaptation has been delayed by a year; so it is, in fact, overdue. Besides, Adam Penford\u2019s production amps up the ghostly effects so it seems fitting in the direct aftermath of Halloween.\nGatiss\u2019s script is surprisingly faithful, given his flair for imaginative reworks of canonical stories (from Dracula to Sherlock), and some dialogue is unchanged along with the words of the narrator (Christopher Godwin). This reminds us of the inherent theatricality in Dickens\u2019s storytelling, heightened with the use of puppets and some bewitching surprises such as a delightful cloud of ghosts that suddenly emerge and swing around the auditorium.\nGatiss also includes Dickens\u2019s dark comedy that is so often overlooked. We begin with a flashback to Marley\u2019s death that seems like a comic prelude as Gatiss \u2013 who plays Marley as well as several minor characters \u2013 dies suddenly in his office. When Nicholas Farrell\u2019s Scrooge realises what has happened, his response is to put out the candle at Marley\u2019s desk and say, smartingly: \u201cWaste not, want not.\u201d\nFarrell\u2019s Ebenezer is a pompous, wizened old grump, largely preoccupied with his ledger at first, every inch \u201cas self-contained and solitary as an oyster.\u201d But he comes out of himself and steers close to comic caricature, with Farrell squeezing laughs from Dickens\u2019s humorous lines. But it comes at a cost: when he visits the parallel worlds of past and future, he does not wring enough emotional drama from his transformative journey but seems instead to stand on the theatrical sidelines.\nCharacters such as Belle and Fezziwig come and go with little sense of individuality. The Cratchits are sweet if a little generic \u2013 a merry, stoic band \u2013 but Gatiss\u2019s ghostly Marley is imaginatively portrayed as a creepily sashaying figure. The ghosts of Christmas past, present and future do not particularly surprise or chill.\nMuch of the drama lies in the lighting, designed by Philip Gladwell (sometimes piercing, sometimes hazy) and sound by Ella Wahlstr\u00f6m (full of jumps and screeches). There is also strong projection work (video design by Nina Dunn and illusion by John Bulleid). Sometimes these effects come too thick and fast, especially the lighting which changes jaggedly. Paul Wills\u2019s set is made up of towering filing cabinets along with doors and beds, all on wheels, which create an almost constant bustle as they come and go, sometimes for only bite-size scenes.\nOther atmosphere-building exchanges \u2013 of an impoverished mother singing to her child, of street crowds \u2013 are too many, too short, and feel like pauses to the story. Some key moments feel too fleeting and don\u2019t carry enough emotion, including Tiny Tim\u2019s deathbed scene. But when the human drama slows down, it gains an emotional catch, such as a romantic pause between Belle (Aoife Gaston) and the young Scrooge, and the final scene between Scrooge and Bob Cratchit (Edward Harrison); we wish for a few more of these.\nThe end brings a clever twist and a great surge in festive feeling, with carol singing and general good cheer. \u201cThere is much about comfort in the story,\u201d noted GK Chesterton, and it does feel comforting here, even this far from Christmas.\nAt Nottingham Playhouse until 20 November and then at Alexandra Palace, London, 26 November-9 January",

Across the first nine months of 2021 slow winds cost the company 2.5bn Danish kroner (\u00a3290m) compared with the previous year. \u00d8rsted makes about two-thirds of its revenues from offshore wind including off the UK\u2019s coasts.\nVestas, the world\u2019s largest wind turbine manufacturer, on Wednesday cut its profit guidance for the second time this year, citing supply chain instability and cost inflation that was hitting the wind power industry.\nIt came as political and business leaders gathered in Glasgow for the Cop 26 UN climate summit, with green energy high up the agenda. Increasing the supply of renewable energy is a key part of ambitions to limit global heating.\nHowever, the slower winds have contributed to the global increase in the prices of gas and other fossil fuel sources of energy before winter in Europe.\nIn the UK, wind energy has provided 60% of energy needs at peak times but becalmed conditions have forced the country to resort to burning gas and coal to keep the lights on.\nHigher gas prices have fed through to retail energy providers, and 18 have gone bust since the start of September after failing to protect themselves against price moves.\nAt the same time, manufacturers have endured months of delays to parts as the rapid recovery from the coronavirus pandemic has knocked timetables out of joint.\nShares in Vestas slumped by 15% on Wednesday in early trading after it revealed that profits had halved during the third quarter of 2021 to \u20ac206m (\u00a3175m). It also cut its forecasts of future earnings.\nVestas\u2019s chief executive, Henrik Andersen, said the company had faced an increasingly challenging global business environment for renewables.\nHe cited \u201csupply chain instability and rising energy prices as well as accelerated cost inflation from raw materials, transport, and turbine components, which severely impacted profitability and limits visibility\u201d.\nMarika Fredriksson, Vestas\u2019s chief financial officer, said: \u201cThe prices are something I don\u2019t think anyone has experienced previously and it\u2019s a very, very tough environment.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s likely it\u2019s going to continue into next year and I don\u2019t see the trend changing,\u201d she said, adding that the company had not cancelled any projects but there had been several delays.\nMads Nipper, \u00d8rsted\u2019s chief executive, said the company had achieved \u201cgood financial results in the third quarter despite low wind speeds and unusual market conditions\u201d.",

        "content": "New Zealand came here in search of two precious points and a hefty boost to their net run rate, and one out of two will have to do. Having sprinted through the first group stage with three wins out of three, Scotland have a less impressive kind of 100% record three games into the Super 12s, but it took an innings of great quality and immense bravery from Martin Guptill to take this game away from them as they eventually lost by 16 runs.\nScotland made several fine contributions, with bat and ball. Mark Watt is having a wonderful tournament and his four overs brought just 13 runs and the wicket of Devon Conway, who gloved a catch to Matt Cross behind the stumps when attempting a reverse sweep. Safyaan Sharif\u2019s first two overs cost two runs and brought two wickets, Daryl Mitchell and Kane Williamson dispatched in the space of four balls (his second two overs went for 26).\nLater Kyle Coetzer, like Guptill a veteran of the meeting between these teams at the 2009 World T20, started Scotland\u2019s innings with real intent; Cross hit Adam Milne for five successive fours (but those balls aside seven off 24); in the space of one Ish Sodhi over George Munsey twice heaved the ball over midwicket for six before clumping down the ground, where Tim Southee took an excellent low, running, one-handed catch; and Michael Leask hit three sixes and as many fours in an outstanding 20-ball 42.\nBut this was Guptill\u2019s match, after an outstanding innings during which it gradually became apparent that he was suffering badly in Dubai\u2019s intense heat. Over the course of the innings the sun dipped behind the west stand, eventually allowing Scotland to bat in full shade, but for most of New Zealand\u2019s knock the square was in full sun, and in trousers, pads, gloves and helmet it must feel like playing in your own microsauna.\nThe first clue that something was amiss came when the 35-year-old started taking off his helmet and either squatting or bending double during breaks in play, and his running gradually turned into a grudging stumble. By the 19th over he spent the interval after Glenn Phillips\u2019s dismissal with his trousers down around his knees to allow a bit of ventilation.\nHe was out next ball, as he tried to hit over long-on but with his strength fading could only guide the ball straight to Calum MacLeod. He had by then been dropped twice by Leask, one a regulation catch at deep midwicket, the other a pull scooped high into the air that looped into the sunshine before dropping to a fielder inches from the rope and thus forced to worry about his feet and his eyes as well as his hands, which turned out to be at least one thing too many.\nGuptill had hit seven sixes, the most of any innings in this tournament, on his way to a 56-ball 93, and somehow those levers had kept swinging with sweet timing even while his torso was having to drag his unwilling legs around, lolloping from end to end as if wearing Wallace and Gromit\u2019s Techno Trousers. In the circumstances it was impressive to see him take the field for the start of Scotland\u2019s innings, and understandable that he was not still on it at the end. \u201cI was,\u201d he said with considerable understatement, \u201cpretty cooked.\u201d",

        "content": "Lady Gaga inhabited her role in upcoming drama House of Gucci off screen and on for a year and a half. Was the \u2018psychological difficulty\u2019 she suffered as a result worth it? \nA Star Is Born was both a blessing and a curse for Lady Gaga. A blessing because it put her at the centre of a commercially successful, Oscar-nominated film, thereby rocketing her to the top of a profession of which she had very little experience. A curse, too, because she was essentially just playing herself; a singer who went from performing in drag bars to commanding huge stages in very little time. Quick, without looking, tell me the name of the character Lady Gaga played in A Star Is Born. You can\u2019t, can you? You\u2019ve always just called her Lady Gaga.\nThis means that she ultimately had two options after A Star Is Born. She could abandon her movie career in the knowledge that she had blurred the line between character and performer more successfully than any actor working today, or she could find another role. A role not so heavily steeped in her own biography. A role that would finally prove to the world that she was an actor of the highest calibre.\nYou already know by now that Lady Gaga chose the second option, since she has appeared in almost every scrap of promotional material that exists for Ridley Scott\u2019s forthcoming House of Gucci. But, nevertheless, she still has to demonstrate that A Star Is Born was not a fluke. And, as an interview with Vogue reveals, she is doing that by proving that she is the actoriest actor who ever actored. There is method, and then there is a vast chasm, and then there is what she put herself through for House of Gucci.\nFor reference, in House of Gucci, she plays Patrizia Reggiani; a real-life socialite of unimaginable wealth who married the heir to the Gucci fashion house then, after he divorced her, served 18 years in prison for hiring a hitman to murder him. The role was previously mooted to be played by Angelina Jolie, Pen\u00e9lope Cruz and Margot Robbie. Just by turning up for work on a job like this, Lady Gaga basically guaranteed herself an Oscar nomination. But clearly that wasn\u2019t enough. Gaga explained to Vogue: \u201cI lived as her [Reggiani] for a year and a half. And I spoke with an accent for nine months of that. Off camera, [too]. I never broke. I stayed with her.\u201d Additionally, her accent training was so vigorous that you might be able to hear subtle variations depending on which Italian town the character is in.\nThere\u2019s more, too. Despite having no indication that Reggiani was a photographer, Gaga started carrying a camera around with her, taking pictures of everything. \u201cI noticed that Patrizia loved beautiful things,\u201d she explained. \u201cIf something wasn\u2019t beautiful, I deleted it.\u201d\nDoes this sound like a difficult undertaking? Does permanently inhabiting the mannerisms and vocal quirks of a stranger for more than a year sound so all-consuming that it carried a risk of poor mental health? You\u2019d be correct, and you\u2019d also be correct in expecting Gaga to explain it in print. Describing the situation as a \u201cpsychological difficulty\u201d, Gaga told Vogue: \u201cI was either in my hotel room, living and speaking as Reggiani, or I was on set, living and speaking as her. I remember I went out into Italy one day with a hat on to take a walk. I hadn\u2019t taken a walk in about two months and I panicked. I thought I was on a movie set.\u201d\nThis is undoubtedly a lot of effort for a film that, judging by its trailers, seems to be about a bunch of cartoon vampires in ironic 1980s dress-up. And it\u2019s also worth pointing out that most actors understand that a line has to be drawn somewhere. It\u2019s one thing to do your research, but quite another to go full Jim & Andy: The Great Beyond. But, still, it seems very clear that Lady Gaga has her sights set high. She is determined to be taken seriously as an actor, and if that means losing complete sight of herself in the pursuit of artistic truth, so be it. Call her Gaga Day-Lewis.",

Many of the experiences detailed in the report \u2013 of poor communication, inconsistent approaches, and prejudicial attitudes \u2013 are not inevitable, and with will and investment could be changed to ensure that, at the very least, survivors are not retraumatised by a system that is supposed to protect them\u201d.\nMalcolm Graham, the deputy chief constable of Police Scotland, welcomed the report, saying it highlighted \u201cthe positive difference specialist officers can make\u201d. He confirmed that the use of video-recorded interviews was being piloted in three divisions and the force was working with Rape Crisis Scotland and the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service.\nHe added: \u201cWe have a duty and an opportunity to lead a change in policing and across society which improves the experiences of all women, and listening to Rape Crisis Scotland and the survivor reference group is an important part of that work. We know there is much still to do.\u201d\nLast month the chief constable, Iain Livingstone, ordered an independent review after an employment tribunal found that a female firearms officer was victimised by Police Scotland colleagues in a \u201chorrific\u201d workplace culture condemned as an \u201cabsolute boys\u2019 club\u201d.",

The Guardian understands the countries involved include the US, UK, Denmark and some developing countries that would receive such finance, including Costa Rica. The European Investment Bank is one of the financial institutions involved.\nDiverting their funding from fossil fuels to low-carbon efforts will generate an estimated $8bn a year around the world for clean energy. The agreement will prevent the funding of any fossil fuel development, including gas, though there are provisions for loopholes.\nHowever, China and Japan, two big funders of fossil fuel development around the world, have shunned the initiative.\nThe countries involved will also be able to continue developing their own fossil fuel resources at home, including oil and gas fields.\nThe US has at least 24 pending fossil fuel projects representing more than 1.6 gigatons of potential greenhouse gas emissions. The UK is licensing new oil and gas fields in the North Sea, despite hosting the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow.\nThe UK will also be able to press ahead with funding a controversial gasfield in Mozambique, because that project is already in the pipeline and the initiative covers only new investments. Funding for fossil fuels from private sources will also not be affected by the agreement.\nThe move also builds on the UK\u2019s efforts to end the overseas financing of coal, as president of the G7 this year as well as host of Cop26.\nThe G7 agreed in May to stop funding coal development overseas, despite resistance from Japan, and China \u2013 one of the biggest funders of coal development around the world.\nCollin Rees, the programme manager at the Oil Change International campaign group, said the initiative, which will be made public on Thursday when the Cop26 summit is focusing on energy issues, would mark a major change in outlook for fossil fuel investment around the world.\nHe said: \u201cThis is a massive step forward. This represents a serious chunk of the current international public finance for fossil fuels. It\u2019s a really big thing, though there may be some devil in the detail.\u201d\nRees pointed to the advice of the International Energy Agency, published in May, that found all new development of fossil fuel resources globally must end after this year if the world was to limit global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.\n\u201cThis move is significant in light of the IEA report,\u201d he said.",

But her supporters insist this criticism just reflects Stone\u2019s determination to take on vested interests.\nEmployed by parliament, rather than the government, to safeguard independence, Stone is the sixth commissioner since the post was created in 1995. She has previously published highly critical reports on the behaviour of the former Labour MP Keith Vaz and the DUP MP Ian Paisley Jr.\nIf Stone decides a sufficiently serious breach of the rules on MPs\u2019 conduct has taken place she can refer the case to parliament\u2019s committee on standards, which is chaired by the Labour MP Chris Bryant.\nStone picked up responsibility for the Vaz inquiry, involving claims that he had procured drugs for sex workers, from her predecessor Kathryn Hudson.\nWhen that inquiry reported, resulting in a six-month suspension for Vaz, then the MP for Leicester East, she complained he had \u201cfailed, repeatedly, to answer direct questions, given incomplete answers and his account [had], in parts, been incredible\u201d, underlining her willingness to be tough with MPs where necessary.\nMore recently she announced she would be reviewing the MPs\u2019 code of conduct to reflect their use of Twitter and other social media, saying in her annual report: \u201cI have been surprised at the way some MPs express their views and opinions on social media.\u201d She opened 26 inquiries between 2020 and 2021, 11 of those on her own initiative, and the rest after cases were referred to her.\nStone was born in Derby and went to school in nearby Belper before taking a degree in sociology and a masters in women\u2019s studies at Loughborough University. She has a long history of tackling politically contentious issues. She previously served as the commissioner for victims and survivors in Northern Ireland, with the delicate task of tackling the legacy of the Troubles.\nStone was also a commissioner for the Independent Police Complaints Commission, overseeing investigations, including into the Rotherham force\u2019s failure to tackle child sex abuse.\nShe began her working life caring for children with disabilities and went on to run the charity Voice UK, which represents people with disabilities who have experienced crime or abuse. She was given an OBE in 2007.\nIn her current post \u2013 and perhaps most relevantly, given Downing Street\u2019s interest in the Paterson case \u2013 Stone has found herself investigating the prime minister\u2019s personal finances.\nShe found against him over a free holiday he took in Mustique courtesy of a Tory donor, because he \u201cdid not make sufficient inquiries to establish the full facts about the funding arrangements for his free accommodation, either before his holiday, as he should have done, or in 2020\u201d. However, Bryant\u2019s committee subsequently sought additional information from the prime minister and the donor in question, the Carphone Warehouse founder, David Ross, and concluded Johnson had correctly declared the luxury stay.\nJohnson is known to have been irked by the investigation into the funding of his 2019 Christmas holiday, which was one of a series into his financial affairs; they included one by the new ministerial standards watchdog, Lord Geidt, into the refurbishment of the Downing Street flat, an issue the Electoral Commission has subsequently been examining.\nGeidt\u2019s predecessor Sir Alex Allan resigned after the government disregarded his finding that the home secretary, Priti Patel, had breached the ministerial code over bullying allegations.\nStone, who began the job in January 2018, is due to serve a five-year term.",

In September, China announced it would no longer fund coal-fired power plants overseas.\nThe research examined databases \u2013 including Oil Change International\u2019s Shift the Subsidies database \u2013 that track public energy financing.\nOf the $36.7bn, it found $28.07bn went to LNG projects in Australia, including $9.67bn to the Ichthys LNG development in north-west Australia and $7.76bn for Australia Pacific LNG in Queensland.\nThe research says the total figure is likely to be higher because many public financial institutions do not publish detailed records of their transactions.\nThree countries supplied Australia the bulk of this LNG financing, with Japan providing 41% ($11.7bn), China 20% ($5.6bn) and South Korea 14% ($3.96bn).\nAbout $6.7bn went to coal projects.\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nThe Jubilee Australia campaigns director, Dina Rui, said public financing for fossil fuels would need to end if countries wanted to avoid the worst effects of the climate crisis.\n\u201cEven the traditionally conservative International Energy Agency says that staying below 1.5C of warming means there can be no new coal, oil or gas projects,\u201d she said.\n\u201cAustralia should support the shift away from fossil fuels, not try to hold back progress by blocking stronger agreements to end public funding of coal and gas.\u201d\nContributions peaked in 2012, when about $18.5bn flowed to Australian projects.\nThe report found contributions had fallen in recent years, particularly in 2020 when $364m went to fossil fuel projects, compared to $317m for renewables.\nBut the research put this down to the Covid-19 pandemic \u201clowering fossil fuel demand and causing project delays, rather than a downwards trend\u201d.\nTim Buckley of the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis said pressure was building on countries to end capital subsidies for fossil fuels.\n\u201cMy number one issue is the constant refrain from the Morrison government that fossil fuels are a low-cost source of energy and that renewables aren\u2019t as cost-effective,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIf they were so viable, why does an industry that has been around for centuries still need subsidies?\u201d\n \nEmail:\u00a0sign up for our\u00a0daily morning and afternoon email newsletters\nApp:\u00a0download our free app\u00a0and never miss the biggest stories\nSocial:\u00a0follow us on YouTube,\u00a0TikTok,\u00a0Instagram,\u00a0Facebook\u00a0or\u00a0Twitter\nPodcast:\u00a0listen to our daily episodes on\u00a0Apple Podcasts,\u00a0Spotify\u00a0or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app\nBut he said the amount of global public finance directed toward fossil fuels had diminished in the past two years, with a shift towards investment in renewables.\n\u201cI expect that trend to continue,\u201d he said.\n\u201cBut the question is why is anyone still providing literally billions in capital subsidies to coal, oil and gas?\u201d",

That comprised $632,700 in June 2020 and $1.49m between July and September 2020, according to its annual report.\nThe company\u2019s revenue increased in 2019-20 and 2020-21, leading to profit of $2.1m and $2.5m, the report shows.\nUnder the jobkeeper program, businesses were required to estimate whether their turnover would decrease by 30-50% when compared to the previous year, depending on their size. There is no suggestion Indue did not qualify for the payments under the rules of the scheme.\nControversially, the government elected not to include a clawback provision to recoup money from those companies that outperformed expectations.\nLabor\u2019s assistant treasury spokesman, Andrew Leigh, who has called for greater accountability for firms that claimed the subsidy, said Indue should voluntarily pay the money back.\n\u201cIndue makes tens of millions of dollars running the cashless debit card for the Morrison government,\u201d he said.\n\u201cNow it turns out they got $2m in jobkeeper, despite increasing their revenues during the pandemic.\u201d\nParliamentary budget office analysis, first reported by the ABC on Tuesday, found the Morrison government paid out a total of $38bn in jobkeeper to businesses that did not suffer sustained downturns during the pandemic.\nSeveral Australian companies have faced public pressure to pay back jobkeeper funds, and some have, but the government has resisted calls to compel them.\nAt the same time, the government has sought to claw back about $50m from 16,000 welfare recipients who were overpaid due to an overlap with jobkeeper payments.\nA spokesperson for Indue said the company met the jobkeeper criteria by estimating their \u201cGST turnover had fallen or would likely fall by 30% or more\u201d.\nThe spokesperson said the company could \u201cconfirm that our actual GST turnover fell by more than 30%\u201d.\nThe money was used to \u201cpreserve employment for Indue staff and allowed Indue to support hardship applications from our customers impacted by the pandemic\u201d.\n\u201cAccordingly, we intend to retain the jobkeeper payments on the basis that Indue met the qualifying criteria, the payments were accessed for legitimate reasons and used by Indue for the purposes it was intended,\u201d the spokesperson said.\nThe spokesperson said the company\u2019s \u201cmodest profit\u201d included its jobkeeper payments.\n\u201cAs outlined in our latest annual report, the government measures supported consumer confidence which assisted payment volumes and revenue to progressively recover as lockdowns lifted,\u201d the spokesperson said.\nRunning the cashless debit card is only one part of the company\u2019s operations, which include other banking services, fraud mitigation and other payment products.\nLeigh\u2019s call for Indue to pay the wage subsidy back comes amid a political fight over the future of the cashless debit card.\nThe scheme aims to reduce social harm \u2013 such as gambling, alcohol and drug abuse \u2013 by quarantining 80% of a person\u2019s payments onto a card that can\u2019t withdraw cash or be used to buy items banned under the program.\nGiven 42% of participants are Indigenous, the government\u2019s card scheme has been branded racist, and cardholders have told Guardian Australia it causes stigma, has led to missed rental payments, and limited their ability to access cheaper goods online or in the cash economy.\nA Senate inquiry previously heard claims one mother could not buy a children\u2019s book from a bookstore because the shop also sold books on distilling alcohol, while a nursing student is said to have been stopped from buying a stethoscope and university books from the Medshop. The Senate submission claimed that Indue staff said she could not buy those things as she may be trying to buy hand sanitisers to drink.\nLabor MP Julian Hill told parliament last month one woman was \u201cforced to beg Indue for permission to buy a bra that fitted her from a shop that wasn\u2019t on the approved list\u201d and \u201cforced to send in photos\u201d.\nThe government insists that such claims are handled by Services Australia, not Indue.\nHill has introduced a private members\u2019 bill to scrap the scheme once it expires at the end of next year and is among a number of backbench Labor MPs claiming the government plans to place age pensioners onto the card.\nAnne Ruston, the social services minister, has described the claim as a \u201clie\u201d, and repeatedly ruled out plans to expand the card to age pensioners.\nThe two-dozen age pensioners currently on the card have volunteered or been placed on the scheme by Cape York\u2019s Family Responsibilities Commission.\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nWhile the Cape York site is overseen by the commission, the government runs the trials in Bundaberg and Hervey Bay in Queensland, the Goldfields and East Kimberley in Western Australia, and Ceduna in South Australia. The card also operates in the Northern Territory.\nLabor argues the card is an example of the privatisation of the welfare system and it has been long opposed by the Greens, welfare groups and grassroots campaigners.\nIndue\u2019s total contract with the government, dating back to 2015, is worth $70m, including a $26m two-year extension when the government won a Senate vote in December to keep the scheme going.\nOne major study into the card\u2019s effects in Ceduna found it had \u201cno substantive impact\u201d while a government commissioned independent report was mostly inconclusive on whether the card had led to a reduction in social harms.\nLast month the government announced participants in the Northern Territory would be able to select from the Traditional Credit Union as well as Indue as their card issuer.",

An expensive compost bin shouldn\u2019t generate more waste \u2026 a smart fan should cool you down.\u201d\nA bladeless fan sold under a number of different brand names and put through its paces by Choice expert tester Adrian Lini was assessed as performing seven times worse than the average tower fan, and 70 times worse than the best fan.\nThe Smarthome Bladeless fan from Kogan sells for a full retail price of $300, but Lini also found imitations of exactly the same design priced as low as $60.\nThe bladeless fans were one of the \u201cworst performing\u201d retail appliances Choice had ever seen, Kirkland said.\n\u201cThe labs originally tested the Kogan model and found it to be the worst we\u2019ve ever tested but once we dug a little further, we found a number of these knock-offs littered across Australian retail,\u201d he said.\nEssentially the same fan was found under different brand names in a number of different stores and across retailers online.\nLini said the fan advertised a lot of \u201cgimmicky features\u201d, but there wasn\u2019t \u201cmuch to it\u201d.\n\u201cIt\u2019s got a poor design, extremely poor performance, a weak motor and a high cost,\u201d he said.\n\u201cOnce you move outside the metre or half a metre range, there\u2019s absolutely no airflow \u2026 at the end of the day, the fan just does not perform.\n\u201cIt\u2019s tricking you into thinking you\u2019re buying something at a different level of quality, but it\u2019s just a very light breeze.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t trust a product off brand name alone \u2026 find independent reviews or go into the store itself,\u201d Lini said.\nKogan did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe Breville FoodCycler, retail price $499, was little more than an \u201cextremely wasteful\u201d and \u201cpointless\u201d compost bin, Choice said.\nThe food disposal system transforms food waste into odourless eco chips for the garden or bin, claiming to reduce waste by about 80%.\n\u201cWe found it bulky, expensive, complicated and noisy,\u201d Kirkland said.\n\u201cThis product is marketed to make you feel like you\u2019re doing the right thing \u2013 putting your food scraps to good use and avoiding landfill.\n\u201cThe reality is you\u2019re buying an alternative to a simple compost bin that will cost at least $2,000 over the course of its lifetime.\u201d\nHome economist and \u201ckitchen nerd\u201d Fiona Mair said the product was \u201ctaking advantage\u201d of people who wanted to look after the environment.\nMair said its intermittent \u201cear piercing\u201d noises drove Choice staff to take it away from its lab for testing \u201cbecause it was so annoying\u201d.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain, we didn\u2019t notice it at first, just this irritating noise doing our head in until we had to move it out of the kitchen lab,\u201d she said.\nThe FoodCycler, which takes between four and six hours to turn waste into eco chips, also requires regular replacement filters, which contribute further to landfill.\nMair said people without access to a garden for composting would be better off asking their local council for food waste bags, or trying a bokashi bin.\n\u201cWhy would you want to spend money to reduce your food waste into landfill when you can buy compost bins or worm farms that virtually cost nothing to do the same thing?\u201d Mayer said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just another appliance that sits on your bench, and it\u2019s contradicting itself. It takes energy to make, it\u2019ll probably end up in landfill, as appliances do, and it\u2019s a waste of money.\u201d\nBreville\u2019s general manager, Lucy Martyn, said Choice\u2019s review missed the \u201cbigger point\u201d that most food waste went to landfill at \u201csignificant cost and grave environmental consequences\u201d.\n\u201cWe completely agree \u2026 that compost bins are a great option for dealing with food waste \u2013 however the reality is \u2026 not everyone can compost and the volume of food waste that makes it to landfill is evidence of that,\u201d she said.\n\u201cBy focusing on this narrow comparison, Choice \u2026 distracts from the more important issue. Every kilogram of food waste in the landfill produces 1.3kg of CO2 \u2026 even when powered by Australia\u2019s predominantly coal-based grid, there\u2019s a net carbon reduction when you FoodCycle versus sending food waste to landfill.\n\u201cThe cost is also misrepresented \u2026 a typical household running the machine three to five times per week will likely require filter replacements every three to six months so we can estimate this at $120 per year. Based on an average power rate of $0.25kWh and 0.8kWh per cycle four times per week this is approximately $42 per year. The bucket lid filters do not require regular replacement.\u201d\nThe Airline Customer Advocate received a Shonky for its alleged inefficiency as a complaints handling body after prolonged Covid flight cancellations left travellers stranded.\nLast year, the Airline Customer Advocate announced it wouldn\u2019t be taking complaints about common problems faced by air travellers during the pandemic, included being offered flight credit in place of a refund.\nThe body is funded by Jetstar, Qantas, Rex and Virgin Australia to provide a \u201cfree and independent service\u201d to facilitate unresolved complaints about participating airline services.\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\n\u201cThe Airline Customer Advocate is no advocate,\u201d Kirkland said.\n\u201cIt can\u2019t investigate your complaint, it can\u2019t make an independent decision and it has no power to make airlines do anything. Instead, it will forward your complaint back to the airline, asking nicely for the airline to respond to you in 20 days. And that\u2019s about it.\n\u201cIt\u2019s basically a complaint forwarding service masquerading as an independent complaints handling body.\nThe Airline Customer Advocate did not respond to a request for comment.\nChoice experts said they were \u201cshocked\u201d to find Kiddylicious Strawberry Fruit Wriggles contained more sugar, in the form of concentrated fruit sugars, than lolly snakes.\nChoice said that claims such as \u201cpacked with real fruit\u201d and \u201cno artificial additives\u201d were liable to lead parents to believe the product was healthy: 61% of respondents to a Choice survey perceived the Kiddylicious wriggles as healthier than jelly snakes.\n\u201cThis product markets itself as a healthy, fun toddler-friendly snack, but the reality is it\u2019s an expensive, sugar-laden dud,\u201d Kirkland said.\n\u201cKiddylicious \u2026 [makes] you feel like you\u2019re doing the right thing by your child, but these lollies are 68% sugar, at a cost of $150 a kilo.\u201d\nA Kiddylicious spokesperson said the sugars contained in the fruit wriggles were \u201cnaturally occurring\u201d in the fruit used to make the product.\n\u201cUnlike lollies, there are no added refined sugars to this product. In fact, for each 12g packet of strawberry fruit wriggles, we use approximately 87g of fresh fruit,\u201d they said. \u201cWe do not employ any marketing tricks, what\u2019s in the pack is clearly labelled on the pack. Our products are portion controlled to provide parents some peace of mind.\u201d\nThe spokesperson said Kiddylicious snacks were marketed as a \u201csometimes food\u201d but specifically formulated for babies and toddlers.\n \u201cOur range is designed to support a child\u2019s development, with shapes, sizes and textures which aid self-feeding, play and co-ordination,\u201d they said.\nBuy-now, pay-later products have rocketed in popularity in recent years, but humm was criticised for allowing customers to borrow up to $30,000 at a time.\n\u201cBuy-now pay-later products have been deliberately designed to avoid safe lending laws,\u201d Kirkland said.\nChoice said loans from such companies fell into a gap in safe lending laws. \u201cThat means they don\u2019t need to check whether you can afford to repay a debt before they lend you money.\u201d\nKirkland said humm, which markets itself as the \u201cbigger\u201d buy-now pay-later brand, demonstrated how \u201cdangerous\u201d these products were.\n\u201cBuy-now pay-later providers like humm like to pretend they are just a modern form of layby, but nobody ever laybyed $30,000. This is unregulated credit, pure and simple,\u201d Kirkland said.\nChoice said it approached humm four times to ask how it checked whether it was lending safely, and \u201ccould not get a straight answer\u201d.\nA spokesperson for humm said it was only contacted on two occasions with two separate sets of questions and responded \u201cquickly, fully and transparently\u201d each time.\nThey said the company provided an interest-free product, built with \u201cconsumers\u2019 best interest at its core\u201d and played a key role in developing the Buy Now Pay Later code of practice.\nThey said humm ran a \u201cseries of checks\u201d for all potential customers including a third-party product suitability check with the third-party credit bureau Illion.\n\u201cFor purchases over $1,000, income verification is mandatory for all purchases. We also conduct thorough identity checks and ensure that we comply with AML obligations,\u201d they said.\n\u201cWe utilise our own sophisticated credit algorithms to ensure that customers have the ability to repay \u2026 our exceptionally low hardship, loss and arrears rates demonstrate that we have this balance right.\u201d",

Coercion is not consent.\u201d\nThese were the words written in black marker on a cardboard pizza box. The cardboard pizza box that was held aloft by Deni Varnhagen at an anti-vaccination rally in Adelaide. \u201cI love being a nurse and coercion is not consent so it\u2019s pretty self-explanatory,\u201d Varnhagen said. \u201cI\u2019m scared for all of us nurses, we\u2019re all terrified, we love working and want to be back working.\u201d\nThe 29-year-old, based on her status as a dual Crows premiership winner, presumably also loves being an AFLW player. The two vocations do not necessarily have to be conflated, but they do help to paint a picture of Australian sport\u2019s reckoning with the refusal of some athletes to get the Covid vaccine.\nVarnhagen doubtless loves being a nurse partly because it gives her job satisfaction to care for sick people in the intensive care units she works. The obvious inherent conflict in that statement is that one might wager the vast majority of hospital patients may not consent to being treated by an unvaccinated nurse. Such a situation arguably represents a form of coercion, which is why vaccination has been mandated for South Australia\u2019s healthcare workers and why Varnhagen was one of almost 400 forced to take leave after refusing the jab, according to figures released by SA Health on Tuesday.\nShe also described the Covid vaccine as a \u201cmedical experiment\u201d. On this, it should be noted the \u201cexperiment\u201d phase of Australia\u2019s approved Covid vaccines has long since passed. The human clinical trials have been done, and the Therapeutic Goods Administration stipulates a high threshold for approval. The real \u201cexperiment\u201d, in this context, likely has more to do with her sporting endeavours \u2013 and those of her colleagues in this sphere who are also hesitant to take the Covid vaccine.\nAustralian sport is embarking on a clinical trial of its own, one of contractual obligations and interstate logistics. As borders begin to reopen, leagues and clubs are navigating a shift away from biosecure bubbles and towards freer travel but with strict regulations about who is allowed to travel where, on what airlines, and to which stadiums.\nThe AFL has already announced all AFL and AFLW players will need to be fully vaccinated by mid-February or be barred from playing and training. The NRL has not followed suit, but admitted the public health orders of state governments or airlines may force their hand. In Victoria, all professional sportspeople entering a stadium must be vaccinated, which would rule out the handful of players reportedly unwilling to get jabbed. Other state rules could yet mean they are unable to play a significant portion of the season.\nPaul Gallen, hardly the oracle on weighty subject matter, made this salient point. \u201cIf a player doesn\u2019t feel comfortable getting the vaccine then I don\u2019t think they should be made to have it,\u201d the former Cronulla and New South Wales captain said last month. \u201cBut if they\u2019re not made to have it and don\u2019t want to have it, they have to face the consequences that come with that.\u201d\nThe players\u2019 union is working with the NRL to develop a policy for handling unvaccinated players from 1 November, when those off-contract will be able to negotiate with rival clubs, but will still be subject to government restrictions due to their vaccination status. Until statewide vaccine mandates were implemented, the Rugby League Players Association expected NRL clubs would employ unvaccinated players.\nIt is an unenviable quagmire for clubs in any code. Already two NBL players have been released from their contracts \u2013 New Zealand Breakers guard Tai Webster and Illawarra Hawks import Travis Trice. Before long the A-Leagues and netball seasons will start. The Australian Open is already the subject of much controversy and conjecture.\nCrows coach Matthew Clarke said on Wednesday he hoped Varnhagen would make the decision to be vaccinated before 19 November, when she is required to have had her first jab to be eligible to play.\n\u201cShe\u2019s continued to engage in the education from the medical team, from the AFL\u2019s medical team and we see that as the opportunity, but ultimately it\u2019s an individual choice,\u201d Clarke told SEN SA. \u201cShe\u2019s been training and doing all the work and been training really well. It\u2019s obviously been a challenging period for her, and for all organisations having to confront this new situation.\u201d\nIf Varnhagen refuses to comply with the AFL\u2019s vaccination policy, the Crows will be able to replace her on their list before the sixth season of the competition begins on 6 January. Clarke confirmed every other AFLW player at the Crows will soon have received both vaccine doses.\n\u201cThe club\u2019s [view] is pretty clear,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re really promoting vaccination and we think it\u2019s really important for the community and our industry. My perspective is that all of the medical advice and the health experts inform me that this is a safe and a really effective mechanism to diminish the impact [of Covid-19].\u201d\nAt the protest, Varnhagen wore a white singlet emblazoned with the words \u201cfreedom to choose\u201d. In terms of her career as both a nurse and AFLW player, her choice carries clear ramifications. For sporting bodies, the outcomes of their choices are less conspicuous.",

Harrods was bought by Qatar Holding, the investment arm of Qatar\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, in 2010 for an estimated \u00a31.5bn.\nThe company blamed government-imposed high street lockdowns for its difficulties and said it had more than halved spending to just under \u00a345m while it reduced the number of staff by 145 to just under 4,000.\nUnited Voices of the World, which represents waiters and chefs at Harrods, said it was balloting members about a strike in Christmas week after demanding pay be raised to a minimum of \u00a312 an hour, from just over \u00a39 an hour at present. It said unrest was partly prompted by a heavy workload for staff after job cuts.\nPetros Elia, the general secretary of UVW, said: \u201cOur members work in the most famous luxury department store in the world, and yet they are paid poverty wages whilst generating millions of pounds in profit for their bosses . Our members are not willing to tolerate this any longer.\u201d\nOn Wednesday night, a Harrods spokesperson said: \u201cAlongside the wider hospitality industry, Harrods has faced an extremely difficult 18 months, with long periods of closure that have entirely removed our ability to operate as normal. However, throughout this, our absolute priority has been the welfare of our staff and safeguarding as many jobs as possible.\n\u201cWe are constantly reviewing our pay policies to ensure they are in line with industry best practice and as well as base salary, Harrods employees receive generous overtime, 100% service charge (minus a minor admin fee) and benefits package.\u201d\nHarrods cut jobs last summer after the chief executive, Michael Ward, said a slump in tourist numbers and the need for social distancing was having \u201ca huge impact on our ability to trade\u201d.\nA note in the company\u2019s accounts published this week said the Covid pandemic had been a \u201csignificant challenge\u201d for the business, which had put the majority of staff on furlough during the enforced store closures. However, there was a rise in online sales over the period.\nHarrods said its import costs had increased by \u00a3500,000 as a result of extra administration and taxes, while the removal of duty-free shopping for travellers in January this year was likely to hit trade from tourists.\nThe company said it had extended the terms of a \u00a3620m loan and a \u00a3200m credit facility repayable in April next year by 18 months.\nIn a statement issued after the accounts were published, Harrods said they reflected the \u201cdevastating\u201d impact of the pandemic on business, but healthy cash reserves and strong growth before the pandemic had helped the retailer \u201cweather the storm that was to come\u201d.\n\u201cWe have a robust programme that will return the business to strength, and whilst we know recovery will take time, the early signs are very positive. We have seen a huge return to demand for luxury and expect strong sales figures as we head into the peak Christmas trading season.\u201d\nThe company said it was planning more outlets for its H beauty store across the UK and a continued investment and presence in China.",

He held that anxiety and other feelings stem from distorted thinking, but this can be challenged and transformed.\nTo convince the psychiatry establishment, he ran a randomised controlled study in the 70s. This was the first of its kind, and showed cognitive behavioural therapy beating the leading drug in helping people with depression.\nIn 1994, with his psychologist daughter, Judith, Beck set up the Beck Institute for Cognitive Behavior Therapy in Philadelphia to train and mentor therapists and advance the technique. More than 2,000 studies have verified CBT\u2019s efficacy and it has branched out from its original use for depression and anxiety to treat addiction, eating disorders and many other mental health issues, as well as pain and even schizophrenia. It is used all over the world and is a mainstay of NHS mental health treatment.\nBeck\u2019s theories grew out of dissatisfaction with the prevailing approach to psychological treatment in the 50s. He had trained as a psychoanalyst and followed the ideas of Sigmund Freud, who believed depression stemmed from repressed anger.\nHowever, Beck\u2019s research into the dreams of depressed people \u2013 Freud considered dreams \u201cthe royal road to the unconscious\u201d \u2013 found otherwise. Beck found one depressed man\u2019s dream, for example, that he was at a formal dance wearing two left shoes, revealed, far from being angry, he was as depressed and sad in his dreams as when awake.\nFrom 1954 Beck worked in the department of psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania and would see patients for psychoanalysis. They would arrive week after week to lie on a couch and free associate \u2013 voice thoughts that randomly came into their head \u2013 as Freud believed mental disorders could be resolved by exploring long-buried memories.\nBeck became restive and sceptical about the role of the therapist: \u201cThe idea was that if you sat back and listened and said \u2018Ah-ha\u2019, somehow their secrets would come out.\u201d\nIn 1960 he had a momentous insight. He asked one of his psychoanalysis patients, who was talking about her sexual encounters, how she felt telling him this and was astonished when she said she felt anxious, as no doubt she was boring him. He discovered she thought she bored everybody, which made her feel anxious and led her to engage in racy exploits to appear more attractive.\nBeck found such \u201cautomatic thoughts\u201d and low self-esteem were common, with many patients convinced they were unlovable or worthless, and these thoughts fuelled their depression or anxiety.\nSo could their mood lift if you altered their thinking? A pragmatic man who enjoyed finding solutions, Beck abandoned the formal psychoanalytic approach and started to offer patients alternative ways of thinking, for example suggesting to a man who said he was unloved as his wife did not say goodbye when she left the house that there might be an alternative explanation. He encouraged his patients to monitor their thoughts, avoid over-generalising and to test their assumptions in \u201chomework\u201d (for example to see if they could manage a social occasion without drinking).\nOver the next decades therapists adapted the basic approach of cognitive behavioural therapy to suit different conditions from depression to panic attacks, eating disorders, insomnia, addiction and pain. In his 70-year career Beck wrote or co-wrote around 600 papers and 25 books, and developed classification systems to measure symptoms of specific disorders and to assess suicide risk. Working well into his 90s, his most recent project was \u201crecovery-orientated cognitive therapy\u201d to help people manage schizophrenia.\nAaron Temkin Beck (known as \u201cTim\u201d) was born in Providence, Rhode Island, the youngest of three surviving children. His parents, Elizabeth (nee Temkin) and Harry Beck, a printer, were Russian-Jewish immigrants. At the age of eight he broke his arm and developed septicaemia, spending a month in hospital. From this time he became phobic about blood and injury, feeling anxious if he smelled ether. However, he learned to manage his anxiety by focusing his mind elsewhere and realised there was a connection between thoughts and feelings.\nAfter gaining an English degree (1942) at Brown University, Rhode Island, Beck studied medicine at Yale University. He originally chose to specialise in neurology, but changed tack to psychiatry and trained in psychoanalysis at the same time. After military service, in 1954 he joined the department of psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania, where he combined research with seeing patients.\nIn 1992 he was made professor emeritus at the university and in 1994 set up his not-for-profit institute to train mental health professionals. He was awarded the Albert Lasker award (2006) in recognition of his work in shaping modern psychotherapy.\nIn 1950 Beck married Phyllis Whitman, a lawyer who became the first female judge in the superior court of Pennsylvania, and the couple had four children. An avid tennis player, he played into his 80s.\nHe is survived by Phyllis, their children, Roy, Judith, Daniel and Alice, 10 grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren.\n Aaron Temkin Beck, psychiatrist, born 21 July 1921; died 1 November 2021",

        "content": "Carbon markets have become a vital tool to make super-polluters pay while rewarding those with low carbon footprints \nCarbon markets are a key tool in helping to drive emissions from the economy by effectively putting a price on pollution. They can take different forms: from mandatory trading of \u2018carbon permits\u2019, to voluntary projects which can help to cut emissions to earn \u2018carbon offsets\u2019.\nAt the Cop26 climate talks delegates will be working towards fine-tuning a little-known, and technically complex, set of carbon trading rules to cut emissions using international carbon markets.\nIn a mandatory emissions trading system, set up by a government or governments, major polluters \u2013 such as factories, power plant owners \u2013 are required every year to match their annual emissions with \u2018allowances\u2019 which can be bought and sold like any other commodity.\nThe catch? There is a limit to the amount of allowances in a market so super-polluters need to pay a steep price to buy enough allowances to cover their emissions \u2013 and polluters who can reduce their emissions can make money by selling their allowances to dirtier rivals.\nIn simple terms, this creates a \u2018pro-market\u2019 incentive for polluters to take climate action. At the end of each year polluters could be asked to show that they have bought enough allowances to cover their annual emissions. Then, the government would reduce the number of allowances in the market to drive further carbon-cutting \u2013 and drive up the price of those permits.\nThe European Union launched the first large-scale emissions trading scheme in the world in 2005 as a central pillar of its climate policy. But the collapse of economic activity following the 2008 financial crisis meant that the market was overwhelmed with more emissions allowances than polluters needed \u2013 creating a very weak carbon price for years. After a series of reforms, the market has reached record highs and is on track to keep rising as economies rebound after the pandemic.\nIn the UK, Brexit has required Britain to recreate its own version of the EU\u2019s carbon market, which came into effect on 1 January 2021. It is similar in structure to the original EU version, although the initial cap on allowances is 5% lower than the UK\u2019s share under the latest phase of the EU trade scheme. It will initially cover domestic flights, electricity generation and industries which use a lot of energy \u2013 but the scheme is expected to expand in the future.\nEarlier this year, China opened the world\u2019s largest emissions trading market, covering 40% of its emissions, and 12% of global emissions, as part of the country\u2019s aim to become \u2018net zero\u2019 by 2060. China will also use a declining cap to ensure emissions fall every year.\nThere are other carbon market schemes \u2013 either running or in development \u2013 in Canada, China, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, Switzerland and the US. The combined value of the world\u2019s carbon markets climbed by a fifth last year to $272bn, a five-fold increase since 2017.\nIn Glasgow delegates will discuss how to deliver Article 6 of the Paris Climate Agreement, which lays the groundwork to establish an international carbon market which can mitigate global emissions.\nThe World Resources Institute has said an international carbon market could work like this: countries that struggle to meet their emissionsreduction targets could buy emissions reductions from other nations that have already cut their emissions more than the amount they had pledged, such as by transitioning to renewable energy.\nIf the rules are structured appropriately, the result can be a win-win for everyone involved; both countries meet their climate commitments, the overachiever is financially rewarded for going above and beyond, and the world gets a step closer to avoiding catastrophic climate change.\nHowever, without iron-clad rules some worry that the scheme could increase global emissions by allowing countries to \u2018double-count\u2019 their carbon saving efforts or take credit for low-carbon projects which would have happened anyway.\nArticle 6 hopes to avoid many of the pitfalls of carbon offset schemes to lead to far deeper climate action than the voluntary carbon offset schemes which in recent years have mushroomed around the globe \u2013 with varying levels of credibility.\nA typical carbon offset scheme might involve a polluter \u2013 either a major multinational company or even an individual \u2013 paying to plant trees in an area affected by deforestation to increase natural carbon absorption. The price would be determined by the cost of planting enough trees to cover their carbon emissions.\nFor an individual this would be small, but for the many major polluters such as oil companies and airlines which plan to use carbon offsetting to meet their corporate climate goals enormous funds are expected to flood into giant offsetting schemes.\nThe problem is that few schemes are properly regulated so there is little way to confirm that they are making a meaningful contribution to cutting emissions. The burgeoning carbon offset industry is already rife with tales of mismanagement.\nFor example, in some schemes which offer to protect areas against deforestation in exchange for carbon offsets it has been found that threat to the trees may have been overstated to increase the number of credits on offer \u2013 which leads to far less climate mitigation than expected.\nMoney from carbon offsets can provide vital financial support for projects seeking to protect and restore some of the most beautiful threatened ecosystems around the world \u2013 so tougher new rules are needed to help these scheme play a meaningful role in climate action.",

They announced on Wednesday that they would begin cutting that stimulus by $15bn a month but left interest rates unchanged.\nHowever the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, also warned that inflation had been \u201clonger lasting than anticipated\u201d. While Powell said the Fed still expected recent price rises to be \u201ctransitory\u201d, he added that it was \u201cvery difficult to predict the persistence of supply constraints or their effects on inflation\u201d.\nIn March 2020 as the pandemic brought the global economy to a shuddering halt, the Fed moved to prop up the US economy by cutting interest rates to close to zero and started buying $120bn a month in Treasury- and mortgage-backed securities.\nThe initiative appears to have helped the US bounce back from a potential economic catastrophe. The unemployment rate has dropped from a record high of 14.7% in April 2020 to 4.8% in September.\nBut now the central bank is wrestling with concerns that its stimulus efforts, combined with cash injections from Washington, pent-up consumer demand and the unprecedented impact of the pandemic on the global supply chain, are driving up inflation.\nAnnual inflation is at a rate unseen in 30 years, according to US government figures released last month. Prices for US goods climbed by 4.4% in the year through September, according to the department of commerce\u2019s latest personal consumption expenditures report, the fastest increase since 1991.\nThe rising cost of fuel is also adding to prices and causing misery for millions of Americans struggling to pay their utility bills.\n\u201cWe understand the difficulties that high inflation poses for individuals and families, particularly those with limited means for higher prices for essentials such as food and transportation,\u201d Powell said.\nAt a press conference he would not be drawn on when or if the Fed would raise rates to tackle inflation but said the Fed would \u201cuse our tools as appropriate\u201d should prices continue to rise.\nPowell, and the Treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, have argued that the sharp rise in prices will decline as the economy recovers from the unprecedented impact of the pandemic.\nThe Fed\u2019s carefully worded post-meeting statements have described high inflation as \u201clargely reflecting transitory factors\u201d since April. But the trend has gone on longer than the central bank first predicted.\nIn August, Powell said the Fed was seeing some \u201cmoderation\u201d in post-pandemic price rises and pointed to the used car market, where prices have skyrocketed as supply has failed to keep up with demand from consumers.\n\u201cUsed car prices, for example, appear to have stabilised. Indeed some price indicators are beginning to fall,\u201d he said. Prices of new and used cars have, however, continued to rise as manufacturers continue to struggle with a global shortage of microprocessors.\nThe Fed statement comes before Friday\u2019s release of the US\u2019s monthly jobs report. In September just 194,000 new jobs were added, well below the 500,000 that economists had predicted.\nThat report was compiled in the middle of the month, when the Delta variant was at its peak. October\u2019s jobs report will be closely watched to see whether the waning of the variant has encouraged more hiring.",

        "content": "Glenn Youngkin won the race to be Virginia\u2019s governor having exploited concerns over teaching about race in schools\nWhat is critical race theory?\nDeveloped by the former Harvard Law professor Derrick Bell and other scholars in the 1970s and 80s, critical race theory, or CRT, examines the ways in which racism was embedded into American law and other modern institutions, maintaining the dominance of white people.\nCRT argues that racism is not a matter of individual bigotry but a systemic issue that creates an uneven playing field for people of colour.\nKimberl\u00e9 Williams Crenshaw, a law professor widely credited with coining the term, told the New York Times: \u201cIt is a way of seeing, attending to, accounting for, tracing and analyzing the ways that race is produced, the ways that racial inequality is facilitated, and the ways that our history has created these inequalities that now can be almost effortlessly reproduced unless we attend to the existence of these inequalities.\u201d\nA year or so ago few people had heard of it, yet Republicans have whipped up a moral panic that CRT is being rammed down the throats of schoolchildren. They caricature it as teaching Black children to internalise victimhood and white children to self-identify as oppressors.\nIs it taught in schools?\nNo, it is not a part of the secondary school curriculum. The National School Boards Association and other education leaders are adamant that CRT is not being taught in K-12 schools, which teach students from five to 18 years old.\nBut Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Fox News and other rightwing media have turned it into a catch-all buzzword for any teaching in schools about race and American history. They loosely apply it to concepts such as equity and anti-bias training for teachers.\nPatti Hidalgo Menders, president of the Loudoun County Republican Women\u2019s Club in Virginia, told the Guardian last week: \u201cThey may not call it critical race theory, but they\u2019re calling it equity, diversity, inclusion. They use culturally responsive training for their teachers. It is fundamentally CRT.\n\u201cIt\u2019s dividing our children into victims and oppressors and what\u2019s a child supposed to do with that?\u201d\nEfforts to weaponise CRT were reinforced by former president Donald Trump and a rightwing ecosystem including influential thinktanks. Last year Christopher Rufo, a conservative scholar now at the Manhattan Institute, told the Fox News host Tucker Carlson that CRT was a form of \u201ccult indoctrination\u201d.\nIn January the Heritage Foundation hosted a panel discussion where the moderator, Angela Sailor, warned: \u201cCritical race theory is the complete rejection of the best ideas of the American founding. This is some dangerous, dangerous philosophical poisoning in the blood stream.\u201d\nWhat role did CRT play in Virginia\u2019s election?\nWinning Republican candidate Glenn Youngkin\u2019s signature issue was education. He hammered government schools on \u201cculture war\u201d issues such as race and transgender rights and falsely claimed that his Democratic opponent, Terry McAuliffe, called his friend, President Joe Biden, and asked the FBI to silence conservative parents.\nYoungkin said he would ban the teaching of CRT in Virginia classrooms. At a campaign event in Glen Allen last month, the candidate said to applause: \u201cWhat we won\u2019t do is teach our children to view everything through the lens of race. On day one, I will ban critical race theory.\u201d\nMcAuliffe was forced on to the defensive and had to engage with the issue. He accused Republicans of using the Trump playbook of division and deceit, a message that did not cut through in the same way.\nWhy did the issue resonate with voters?\nThis can be seen as a rightwing backlash to last year\u2019s Black Lives Matter protests and conversations about structural racism that followed the police murder of George Floyd, an African American man in Minneapolis. It also can be seen as a response to America\u2019s changing demographics, specifically the increase in the minority population.\nIt also comes after lengthy school closures during the pandemic infuriated many parents. School board meetings in Virginia and elsewhere have turned ugly, even violent, and protest signs calling for bans on masks and CRT are sometimes almost interchangeable.\nThis week conservatives targeted school board elections nationwide over masking rules and teaching racial justice issues. In Virginia, 14% of voters listed education as a top issue, and about seven of 10 of those voted for Youngkin.\nMcAuliffe did not help himself when, during a debate, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t believe parents should be telling schools what they should teach\u201d \u2013 a line that was constantly replayed in Youngkin attacks ads.\nYoungkin also highlighted a high school bathroom sexual assault case in affluent Loudoun county, in northern Virginia, to argue against allowing transgender students into their chosen restrooms.\nIs it just Virginia?\nNo. Officials in Republican-controlled states across America are proposing numerous laws to ban teachers from emphasizing the role of systemic racism. Legislation aiming to curb how teachers talk about race has been considered by at least 15 states, according to research by Education Week.\nRon DeSantis, the governor of Florida, has described CRT as \u201cstate-sanctioned racism\u201d.\nBrad Little, the governor of Idaho, signed into law a measure banning public schools from teaching CRT, which it claimed will \u201cexacerbate and inflame divisions on the basis of sex, race, ethnicity, religion, color, national origin, or other criteria in ways contrary to the unity of the nation and the wellbeing of the state of Idaho and its citizens\u201d.\nRed states are also targeting the 1619 Project, a series by the New York Times which contends that modern American history began with the arrival of enslaved people four centuries ago and examines that legacy.\nRepublicans are expected to use the Youngkin formula to woo suburban voters in next year\u2019s midterm elections for Congress.",

        "content": "A look at how the standards watchdog views the stance of the former cabinet minister who has avoided suspension\nAt the final hour the Tory MP Owen Paterson escaped an immediate 30-day suspension from the House of Commons for an \u201cegregious\u201d breach of lobbying rules, and avoided a possible byelection.\nHe convinced the government and some fellow backbenchers to vote to spare him from the sanction, which was recommended by the standards committee watchdog, and to instead refer his case to a new committee chaired by a Conservative former cabinet minister, John Whittingdale.\nAlthough Paterson, the MP for North Shropshire, protested his innocence, several of those who backed reform of the standards system still believe he broke the rules and should be punished. It will now be up to the new committee to assess the evidence and make recommendations about what should happen to him.\nHere are the claims Paterson made, along with analysis of how they stack up.\nPaterson\u2019s claim: He made approaches to government bodies about two firms, Randox and Lynn\u2019s Country Foods, which employed him as a consultant. The MP said he was acting as a whistleblower in raising concerns about milk and pork standards and that this meant he could claim an exemption from the rules regarding paid advocacy because he was raising a \u201cserious wrong\u201d.\nWatchdog response: While this excuse would have been permissible for an initial approach, Patterson\u2019s investigators said it did not cover his follow-up letters and meetings. \u201cWhat might have been permissible in a single exceptional case, became Paterson\u2019s standard practice,\u201d said the standards commissioner, Kathryn Stone, adding that it \u201cstretches credulity to suggest that 14 approaches to ministers and public officials were all attempts to avert a serious wrong rather than to favour Randox and Lynn\u2019s, however much Paterson may have persuaded himself he is in the right.\u201d\nThe committee agreed. It said Paterson\u2019s follow-up approaches \u201csought to promote Randox products\u201d by praising their \u201csuperior technology\u201d and that he promoted other unrelated products from the company. \u201cThese were all attempts to confer a benefit on Randox, to whom he was a paid consultant,\u201d it found. \u201cAt best, Paterson was relying on an exemption he thought probably existed but of whose terms he was unsure. At worst, Paterson was knowingly in breach of the lobbying rules.\u201d\nThe committee also agreed that Paterson\u2019s attempts to get one of Lynn\u2019s Country Foods\u2019 competitors to relabel their product so as not to compete with Lynn\u2019s own nitrite-free goods, as well his asking for this to be promoted in the press, was not incidental.\nPaterson was paid more than \u00a3100,000 for his work for Randox and Lynn\u2019s, and the committee was clear. \u201cThe paid advocacy rule does not distinguish between lobbying for good causes and lobbying for bad causes. It only applies to lobbying for reward or consideration.\u201d It added that Paterson \u201cwent beyond presenting evidence of a serious wrong\u201d in his follow-up approaches to the Food Standards Agency about milk testing.\nPaterson\u2019s claim: Paterson said the investigation against him was biased because the commissioner did not interview 17 witnesses who wanted to defend him and provide testimony about what was discussed at various meetings.\nWatchdog response: The 17 witnesses provided written statements, which the standards committee said they received and read. However, the committee said that they \u201cdo not see what further relevant information could usefully be gleaned by inviting oral evidence from the witnesses concerned\u201d.\nPaterson claimed the witnesses would testify that his intentions were good. But the committee said \u201csubjective motivation is not the test under the lobbying rules\u201d and that seven of the 14 approaches found to be in breach of paid advocacy rules were emails or letters from Paterson personally, meaning oral evidence from those who supported him was unlikely to materially alter its conclusions.\nPaterson\u2019s claim: His only admission of wrongdoing was having written two letters on Commons-headed taxpayer-funded notepaper. But the major misuse of facilities he denied was hosting meetings in his parliamentary office 16 times between October 2016 and February 2020. He admitted holding the meetings but said the use of his office was \u201coccasional\u201d, and whips told MPs to remain on the estate because parliamentary business at that time was unpredictable.\nWatchdog response: It came down to a matter of interpretation but the committee said the number of meetings clearly \u201cwent beyond the latitude normally afforded under the rules\u201d. Paterson claimed he \u201ckept his commercial interests entirely separate from his parliamentary activities\u201d but the committee said he should not have used his parliamentary office to conduct business meetings with his paying clients, and that it was trying to take a proportionate and consistent approach with previous rulings on similar issues.\nPaterson\u2019s claim: Paterson said the \u201cmanner\u201d of the standards commissioner\u2019s pursuit of the inquiry played a major role in driving his wife, Rose, to take her own life last summer at the age of 63.\nWatchdog response: While this was his belief, the committee called it an \u201cunsubstantiated, serious and personal\u201d allegation against the integrity of the commissioner and her team, who were unable to respond publicly.",

I asked them why they needed them and they said that it was because it is very cold at night, as they were planning on sleeping outside.\n\u201cWe have been struggling with accommodation for people arriving in Glasgow, as they\u2019re coming in great numbers and hundreds are being left with nowhere to stay, which is even more worrying as the temperature drops.\u201d\nGinger, an activist from Bristol who is staying there after struggling to find a bed elsewhere, said: \u201cThere was a massive lack of affordable accommodation in Glasgow, and we don\u2019t get funded to stay here. Also, it\u2019s very helpful to be able to stay with people who are here for similar reasons.\u201d\n\u201cThe message of Cop is all about the power and responsibility of the world leaders. I think they keep on misusing that power, so this is a way of reclaiming space and doing things differently ourselves.\u201d\nAt previous summits, local governments have worked with activists to provide hostel-style accommodation for those who could not afford expensive hotel rooms, converting gym halls and community centres into bunkhouses. Scottish Green councillor Christy Mearns has pressed Glasgow city council to act more creatively, while recognising that Covid-19 restrictions added an extra layer of difficulty this year.\nMearns said: \u201cThe council should have done more to foresee these problems with accommodation, particularly for people from more marginalised communities whose voices should be heard at the summit. I support the grassroots efforts of people coming together to work around this.\u201d\nA Glasgow city council spokesperson said: \u201cThe former Hamish Allan Centre has been closed for years and the building is not safe for human habitation. There are concerns about fire safety and possible asbestos.\n\u201cIt was shut down, as it did not provide acceptable accommodation at that time and the residents moved to more appropriate properties. The council did not provide access to the building and it\u2019s concerning that people have moved in.\u201d",

        "content": "The AI firm\u2019s journey so far shows nobody has a real idea of what cyber-fighting tech is worth\nA loss-making business that uses artificial intelligence to spot cyber abnormalities was never likely to be easy to value but, even with that proviso, Darktrace\u2019s first six months as a public company have been extraordinary.\nThe story so far is a listing at 250p in May to a rapturous reception. By September, the shares were touching \u00a310, equating to a valuation of \u00a37bn, enough for entry to the FTSE 100 index to replace private equity-bound Morrisons. The decline started almost simultaneously. The shares lost a fifth one day last week as a broker turned bearish, and have mostly kept falling. Wednesday\u2019s 5% tumble took the price to 600p.\nThat still represents a splendid gain for buyers at IPO. On the other hand, they will be cursing themselves for not banking a few quid at the top. The next round of potential drama relates to the end of the six-month lock-up period for pre-IPO investors. A couple have already trimmed their holdings, and eyes are now trained on Mike Lynch, the ex-Autonomy chief who owns 16% with his wife.\nDarktrace has delivered better-than-expected sales numbers in its brief time as a public company, so has not upset its growth narrative one jot. The shares will settle eventually but the only conclusion one can draw so far is that this is a case of sentiment-driven investing on steroids. The cyber-fighting tech is clearly interesting, but nobody has a real idea of what it\u2019s worth.\nOne factor behind a 5% decline in punters\u2019 stakes in the UK and Ireland, explained the gambling giant Flutter earlier this week, was \u201cfurther enhancements to our safer gambling approach\u201d. In other words, controls to tackle the social blight of problem gambling can now be felt in the revenue line. Very good but the enhancements clearly have not been enhanced enough.\nA Flutter operation, Sky Vegas, has committed a serious no-no by offering free \u201cspins\u201d \u2013 free bets on online casino games \u2013 to recovering gambling addicts who had actively registered not to receive promotional material. It\u2019s a little like a pub landlord sending whisky miniatures to alcoholics who had voluntarily barred themselves from the premises.\nAn apologetic Sky Vegas could not immediately explain what went wrong but knows it has messed up in basic fashion. Self-exclusion lists are the cornerstone of the industry\u2019s attempt to present a cleaner image. If a unit of the UK\u2019s biggest gambling company cannot be relied upon to implement IT controls competently, boasts about the supposed advantages of self-regulation ring hollow.\nAs it happens, the government is preparing a white paper on gambling reform in which a ban on \u201cfree\u201d bets is one of many ideas under consideration. Go for it. The world would not be poorer if bookies were told to send us fewer invitations to lose our money on soulless electronic roulette wheels.\nNext has upgraded its profit guidance four times this year, which the chief executive, Simon Wolfson, had to concede, at the time of the last revision in September, was slightly embarrassing. Boardroom caution is preferable to blind optimism, but best not to overdo things.\nWednesday\u2019s trading update marked the end of the run of upgrades, however. Next is sticking to its last prediction of \u00a3800m, despite sales in the past five weeks being stronger than expected. In practice, one suspects the company will beat the round number by a few million quid (Wolfson hasn\u2019t suddenly stopped being prudent) but the change of tone looks significant for the wider retail sector.\nNext is a better guide to the consumer mood than the likes of Marks & Spencer, which is a self-help story these days. If it is feeling relatively less bullish about pre-Christmas trading, others will be too. The reasons also matter.\nFirst, the post-lockdown pent-up demand factor was fading, Wolfson reported. Yes, that was bound to happen; the surprise is that the post-lockdown whoosh lasted so long. Second, labour shortages and blockages in international supply chain mean extra costs. Again, that\u2019s not a surprise.\nThe third factor is the trickiest to read: households being obliged to spend more on essentials like petrol and energy, leaving less for discretionary purchases such as clothes. Consumer finances were still in \u201cgood shape\u201d, stressed Wolfson. And he was only talking about \u201cmoderation\u201d in spending.\nGiven that average energy bills could rise by \u00a3400-\u00a3500 in April, that looks the biggest loose piece in the cost-of-living outlook. Big retailers have generally enjoyed the 2021 recovery (and Next\u2019s \u00a3800m would be its highest profits since 2016) but the financial weather looks to be turning.",

However, the nine-strong panel could still choose to wait for more evidence from the economy before raising rates.\n\u201cThose pressures still look predominantly to be the result of the adjustment pains of an economy emerging from hibernation, which should give pause for thought,\u201d he said.\nFinancial markets have put the odds of a rate rise at more than 60%. However, some economists have suggested the Bank could wait until its next meeting in December, or even February, before raising borrowing costs.\nAnalysts have argued that a lack of guidance away from a November rate rise from Andrew Bailey, the Bank\u2019s governor, indicates that action at Thursday\u2019s meeting is more likely than not. Investors expect that any move would be small, with a rise from 0.1% to 0.25% the most likely first step from the Bank.\nAndrew Montlake, the managing director of Coreco, a mortgage broker, said the central bank faced a delicate balancing act. \u201c[It will be] keen to avoid anything that might derail a recovery on one side, or hold off too long to be behind the curve on the other leading to faster, sharper rises,\u201d he said. \u201cWhilst these decisions remain on a knife-edge, one thing we do know is that we should all be preparing for rate rises sooner rather than later.\u201d\nAccording to the IHS Markit/Cips survey of 650 companies in the services sector, which includes hotels, restaurants and financial services, business and consumer spending increased in response to the rollback of pandemic restrictions at home and abroad.\nThe purchasing managers\u2019 index for October came in at 59.1, up from 55.4 in September, beating the forecasts of City economists. Anything above 50 points indicates activity is rising.\nIn a promising early signal for the jobs market after the closure of the furlough scheme at the end of September, about 30% of the survey panel reported an increase in employment numbers during October, while only 13% signalled a reduction.\nFirms commented on exceptionally strong demand in the hospitality, leisure and transportation sectors. Where a decline in employment was reported, companies blamed unusually high staff turnover amid a bidding war for staff as rivals raised starting salaries to recruit workers.\nDespite the strongest growth in activity since July, the majority of service sector companies warned of an increase in their costs, driven by soaring prices for fuel, energy, raw materials, transport and staff.\nThe latest official figures show inflation as measured by the consumer prices index eased slightly to 3.1% in September, down from 3.2% in the previous month. Inflation is expected to peak close to 5% next year, before gradually falling back towards the Bank\u2019s 2% target rate as disruption to the global economy caused by Covid fades.\nDuncan Brock, the group director at Cips, said escalating business costs remained deeply concerning despite the strong performance in October. \u201cThe seemingly likely rise in interest rates this week may take some of the heat out of the over-inflating UK economy but will also result in additional pressure on some household budgets, threatening to cut off this stream of good fortune early next year.\u201d",

So too were senior French ministers and officials, including France\u2019s president, Emmanuel Macron.\nNSO has staunchly denied that any US or French officials have been targeted by its clients.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a harsh step but I assume it\u2019s because the Israelis weren\u2019t getting the message on the need for them to back NSO off,\u201d said James Lewis, senior vice-president and director of the strategic technologies program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\nThe question now is what effect the US move will have \u2013 given how strategically important the surveillance industry is to Israel, one of the world\u2019s largest exporters of spyware and similar tools. Technically, NSO\u2019s inclusion on the so-called Entity List means that the company requires a special license to use any US-originating technology in its services.\n\u201cNSO will go away. Maybe the Israelis will quietly tell their companies to cool it. But it\u2019s too important a market for them,\u201d Lewis said.\nBut the implications are deeper than the technical restrictions. Foreign governments \u2013 especially in Europe \u2013 who use NSO spyware will now be knowingly working with a company that is seen by the Biden administration as a threat to US interests. That conclusion is based on a unanimous committee of US agencies, which includes the departments of state, defense, energy and \u2013 in some cases \u2013 the US treasury.\nIt also raises alarms for the company\u2019s investors, including the largest single investor in the fund that owns NSO: the Oregon public pension fund. A spokesperson for the fund declined to comment.\nNSO said it was \u201cdismayed\u201d by the news and would challenge the findings. Rod Rosenstein, the former deputy attorney general who serves as a lawyer for NSO, did not comment on whether he would continue to represent the company.\nNazak Nikakhtar, a former commerce department official who now serves as a partner at the Washington DC law firm Wiley Rein, said the move to add NSO to the US blacklist showed the US had become \u201chyper-vigilant\u201d on issues around surveillance and cyber attacks, even when they involve nations that are allies.\nNikakhtar said it was likely that the decision had been based on a US intelligence report that traced \u201csignificant actions\u201d to the company. \u201cOne bad act can trigger it, if it\u2019s significant enough,\u201d she added.\n\u201cWe may not always be able to bring these perpetrators to justice or bring a prosecution against them. This designation is another tool the US government has to go after those and to penalize the company,\u201d she said. \u201cThe reputational harm is significant.\u201d",

She said a lack of support from her colleagues and the unions led her to resign.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a small group of people who are absolutely opposed to the sorts of things I say and instead of getting involved in arguing with me, using reason, evidence, the traditional university methods, they tell their students in lectures that I pose a harm to trans students, or they go on to Twitter and say that I\u2019m a bigot.\n\u201cSo thus creating an atmosphere in which the students then become much more extreme and much more empowered to do what they did,\u201d Stock said.\nStock said her \u201cpersonal tipping point\u201d came after Sussex\u2019s branch of the University and College Union responded to a protest against Stock on campus in early October by calling for a university-wide investigation into transphobia.\n\u201cIt was when I saw my own union branch\u2019s statement, which basically backed the protesters and implicitly made it obvious that they thought I was transphobic and accused Sussex University of institutional transphobia,\u201d Stock said.\n\u201cWhen union committee members basically back intimidation against you as an employee, then that\u2019s a bit of a blow.\u201d\nThe philosophy professor was awarded an OBE in the 2021 New Year honours list for services to higher education.\nBut more than 600 academics criticised the decision, signing an open letter that criticised Stock\u2019s comments on trans and gender non-conforming people. The letter said her \u201charmful rhetoric\u201d reinforced \u201cthe patriarchal status quo\u201d.\nThe academics said they were concerned there was a \u201ctendency to mistake transphobic fearmongering for valuable scholarship, and attacks on already marginalised people for courageous exercises of free speech\u201d.\nStock told the BBC her recent time on campus was \u201clike some sort of surreal, terrible anxiety dream, to see your name plastered over every wall \u2026 Lots and lots of young people and all eyes are on you and all fingers seem to be pointing at you. It\u2019s like some sort of medieval experience.\u201d\nOn her most recent attempt to visit the university, Stock described being confronted by posters calling her a transphobe and demanding that she be fired. \u201cI just turned around, ran back up to the train station, hyperventilating and got the first train I could home,\u201d she said.\nWhile Stock exempted members of her former department from joining the ostracism, she said the university could have done more to curb the behaviour of other staff members and to support her from external abuse.\nAsked to respond to trans students who accused Stock of making them feel unsafe while at Sussex, Stock said it was hyperbole.\n\u201cWhether you feel unsafe and whether you are unsafe are two different things. As philosophers we constantly distinguish between appearances and reality, and my book is not actually making them physically unsafe,\u201d Stock said.\nStock has been criticised for being a trustee of the LGB Alliance, which describes itself as promoting \u201cthe rights of lesbians, bisexuals & gay men, as recognised by biological sex\u201d.

That it was taking place on the very day the Commons was supposed to be voting to impose a 30-day suspension on Paterson \u2013 something that would ordinarily have gone through on the nod \u2013 was entirely coincidental.\nAt least that was roughly the explanation offered by Boris Johnson to Angela Rayner at prime minister\u2019s questions.\nThe thing about Owen was that he seemed spectacularly dim. Off the scale dim. So stupid that he thought Randox and Lynn\u2019s Country Foods were paying him more than 9k a month for his brilliance.\nAnd because they quite liked him. Certainly not to seek any commercial advantage from paid advocacy.\nSo dim also, that it had never occurred to him that he might be able to get up in parliament or go to the media to blow the whistle on concerns of contaminated milks and dodgy meat, rather than have a quick word in a minister\u2019s ear.\nEspecially when he was offering Randox and Lynn\u2019s as solutions to these problems. So dim that he was found to have breached the rules at least 14 times and still couldn\u2019t see what he had done wrong after the parliamentary commissioner on standards had repeatedly pointed it out to him.\nThis was also roughly the same argument that Jacob Rees-Mogg used to open the 90-minute debate as he chose to talk about the amendment as a fait accompli even before Leadsom had introduced it.\nHe wasn\u2019t there to judge whether Paterson had breached the rules or not. That was not within his remit. All he was asking for was that another committee might be formed that would come to a different conclusion and let Owen off.\nOne that would make allowances for particularly thick MPs who were seemingly unable to grasp the consequences of their actions.\nPredictably there were many interventions from opposition MPs, including Jess Phillips, Angela Eagle, Caroline Lucas and Margaret Hodge, all of whom were at pains to point out the obvious.\nThe whole thing stank. This was as clear an example of Tory sleaze as you could hope for. The government hadn\u2019t got the result it had wanted from the investigation so it was going to set up another body who would come up with the correct one. One rule for MPs, one for the rest of the country. No wonder people\u2019s trust in politicians was so low.\nRees-Mogg was horrified that anyone could believe this of him. The whole point of making this debate a party political issue was precisely because it wasn\u2019t.\nLabour were bound to vote against the amendment because they believed in the old-fashioned, tribal values of natural justice so it was important that the Tories changed the rules and Boris Johnson called a three-line whip to get his man off. And it was some kind of remainer plot as all the Tories who had been busted by the commissioner were leavers. Or something. It\u2019s often hard to follow his train of thought as it isn\u2019t always clear there is one.\nLabour\u2019s shadow leader of the Commons, Thangam Debbonaire, kept it short and sweet, pointing out that the Tories had never expressed any doubt about the probity of the system before.\nIndeed they had gone out of their way to insist that sex-pest Tory MP Rob Roberts couldn\u2019t be subject to a recall petition as it would be completely wrong to change the rules retrospectively. But now apparently it was OK. Go figure.\nMuch of the rest of the debate passed for surreal performance art. A government doing its best to trash what remained of it and parliament\u2019s reputation, while daring the public not to notice.\nWe even got Leadsom claiming her new committee was politically balanced as it had more Tories on it than opposition MPs. The SNP said it wouldn\u2019t be taking up its one token seat and Labour later followed suit.\nSo who is going to end up on the committee is a mystery.\nPresumably Mark Francois, Craig Mackinlay and the four other Tory MPs whose suspensions had been recommended by the commissioner and had signed Leadsom\u2019s amendment were free?\nNot all Tories look quite so enthused about the standards coup. Peter Bottomley said he couldn\u2019t vote for it and Aaron Bell said it would be moving the goalposts \u2013 it would make a change for Paterson from the badgers moving them.\nSteve Baker offered the unusual insight that the new committee could make things worse for Paterson.\nChris Bryant, chair of the standards committee, wound things up. More in sorrow than in anger. The process had been absolutely transparent. It had moved at Paterson\u2019s pace. His witnesses had been heard. And he\u2019d had right of reply at various stages along the way. It was calm, forensic and devastating.\nPaterson, who had been sitting wordlessly on the Conservative benches throughout, looked as if the penny had finally dropped \u2013 and he had begun to question his innocence.\nThough not enough to vote against himself. Which was just as well as the government only won its three-line whip by 18 votes. There were a few Tories that had voted against the amendment and more that had abstained. And most of those who had voted for it had done so knowing they had sold what remained of their souls.\nJust when you think the government can\u2019t get much worse, it finds new ways to surprise you.\nA Farewell to Calm by John Crace (Guardian Faber, \u00a39.99).

        "content": "Republicans in the US Senate again blocked a significant voting rights bill from advancing on Wednesday, a move many see as a breaking point in the push to get rid of the filibuster, the Senate rule that requires 60 votes to advance most legislation.\nThe bill \u2013 the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act \u2013 is one of two major pieces of voting rights legislation Democrats are championing in Congress in an effort to fend off attempts across the US by Republicans to erode easy access to the vote. Those efforts often most affect communities of color.\nThe measure, approved by the US House in August, would have implemented a formula at the heart of the 1965 Voting Rights Act that required certain places, where there was repeated evidence of voting discrimination over the last 25 years, to get any voting changes pre-cleared by the federal government.\nThe US supreme court struck down a previous version of the formula in 2013, saying it was outdated, a widely criticized ruling that civil rights groups say opened the door to voting discrimination.\nThere was never any serious prospect of the bill passing \u2013 only one Republican senator, Lisa Murkowski, supported it. The vote in the Senate was 50-49 in favor of advancing the bill.\nBut Wednesday\u2019s vote was targeted towards Senator Joe Manchin, the West Virginia Democrat who supports the filibuster, showing him that passing voting rights legislation is not possible while the filibuster remains in place.\nMany Democrats hope it will be the final straw for Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, an Arizona Democrat, who is also a staunch defender of the filibuster. Republicans have successfully filibustered voting rights bill three times already this year, including once just two weeks ago.\nChuck Schumer, the Senate majority leader, said Wednesday\u2019s filibuster was a \u201clow, low point in the history of this body\u201d.\nHe continued to suggest Democrats would consider options for getting rid of the filibuster, saying they would \u201cexplore whatever path\u201d was needed to restore the Senate to its status as a deliberative body. He said the gears of Congress\u2019s upper chamber had \u201cossified\u201d and that Democrats were committed to continuing to push forward on voting rights \u201ceven if it means going at it alone\u201d.\nNineteen states enacted nearly three dozen laws that make it harder to vote between January and the end of September, according to a tally by the Brennan Center for Justice. While the John Lewis bill would not necessarily have blocked all of them, it would have required some states, including Florida, Georgia and Texas, to get their policies reviewed before they were implemented.\n\u201cFor the fourth time this year, Republicans have filibustered federal voting rights legislation. Whether it\u2019s the original version of the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, the substitute amendment backed by Senator Murkowski, or other good faith legislative efforts to forge compromise and deliver on federal voting rights legislation, it\u2019s crystal clear that Senator Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans will weaponize the filibuster to block progress,\u201d said Eli Zupnik, a spokesman for Fix Our Senate, which supports getting rid of the filibuster. \u201cOur question now to President Biden and Senate Democrats is this: what are you going to do about it?\u201d .\nThere is increasing urgency for Democrats to pass both the John Lewis measure and the Freedom to Vote Act, the other major voting rights legislation that aims to outlaw excessive partisan gerrymandering and would require early voting, no-excuse mail-in voting, as well as automatic and same-day registration.\nState lawmakers are quickly passing new electoral districts that weaken the votes of minority voters and are distorted to lock in partisan advantages for the next decade. Democrats are also largely expected to lose control of the US House of Representatives next November.\nDemocrats have already started to escalate the pressure.\nJoe Biden gave a strong public endorsement of changing the rule last month for voting rights legislation \u201cand maybe more\u201d.\nBut it\u2019s unclear whether Manchin and Sinema, who have largely stymied Democratic ambitions in Congress so far, will budge. Manchin has indicated he does not support a filibuster carve out for voting rights legislation.\nCivil rights groups have been pressing Democrats for months to get rid of the filibuster to pass voting reforms, publicly voicing their frustration that the White House isn\u2019t putting enough political muscle behind the issue. Dozens of activists, including the son of Martin Luther King Jr were arrested outside the White House demonstrating ahead of the vote on Wednesday.\n\u201cDon\u2019t take the Black vote for granted. Don\u2019t torpedo our democracy. Our future depends on the restoration of voting rights for all,\u201d said Derrick Johnson, the president and CEO of the NAACP. \u201cThose who made campaign promises to the Black community must use any means possible to ensure that this Congress gets it done. The urgency of this issue cannot be overstated. We are watching.\u201d\n\u201cWe have had moments of bipartisanship on voting rights in our nation\u2019s history, but sadly, this is not one of them. The only way to protect the freedom to vote is to end the filibuster,\u201d said Sean Eldridge, the president of Stand Up America, and one of the people arrested on Wednesday.\n\u201cThe King family and civil rights leaders from across the country came to the White House today because President Biden has the largest soapbox on the planet, and we\u2019re asking him to use it to protect voting rights before it\u2019s too late.\u201d",

Several other people were rescued.\nThe latest suspected tragedy emerged after 500 more migrants crossed the Channel during the day, taking the total so far this year to over 20,000 \u2013 more than double 2020\u2019s 8,420 total.\nA man was feared to have drowned off the coast of Essex last week after trying to cross the Channel in a small boat. Two other people, believed to be from Somalia, were rescued after a coordinated search and rescue mission near the port of Harwich.\nOn Wednesday, it also emerged that a passenger ferry rescued 13 people from a sinking dinghy after stopping on its usual route from Dover to Calais.\nThe Isle of Inishmore launched a rescue craft whose crew threw a rope to the small boat, which had run out of fuel and was being steered by a man with a paddle. The small boat\u2019s passengers were returned to France.\nWitnesses have described another steady stream of arrivals for the second day in a row amid relatively calm and sunny conditions at sea.\nIn the port of Dover, dozens of recent arrivals were brought to shore by RNLI lifeboats, reports claimed.\nA young child holding a cuddly toy and wearing just one wellington boot was among the large numbers of people seen being brought ashore.\nThe Home Office has not yet confirmed Wednesday\u2019s numbers after the 456 who reached the UK on Tuesday.\nIn 2019, the home secretary, Priti Patel, promised to make migrant crossings an \u201cinfrequent phenomenon\u201d by spring 2020 and then pledged in August last year to \u201cmake this route unviable\u201d.

        "content": "Critics say pledge to end use of dirtiest fuel source in 2030s and 40s does not go far enough\nMore than 40 countries have agreed to phase out their use of coal-fired power, the dirtiest fuel source, in a boost to UK hopes of a deal to \u201ckeep 1.5C alive\u201d, from the Cop26 climate summit.\nMajor coal-using countries, including Canada, Poland, South Korea, Ukraine, Indonesia and Vietnam, will phase out their use of coal for electricity generation, with the bigger economies doing so in the 2030s, and smaller economies doing so in the 2040s.\nHowever, some of the world\u2019s biggest coal-dependent economies, including Australia, China, India and the US were missing from the deal, and experts and campaigners told the Guardian the phase-out deadlines countries signed up to were much too late.\nThe goal of \u201cconsigning coal to history\u201d has been a key focus for the UK as host of the Cop26 summit, which aims to put the world on track to limit global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.\nKwasi Kwarteng, the UK\u2019s business secretary, said: \u201cToday marks a milestone moment in our global efforts to tackle climate change, as nations from all corners of the world unite in Glasgow to declare that coal has no part to play in our future power generation. Today\u2019s ambitious commitments made by our international partners demonstrate that the end of coal is in sight.\u201d\nCoal use is one of the biggest causes of greenhouse gas emissions, according to the International Energy Agency, and use of the polluting fuel has rebounded after the temporary plunge in emissions caused by last year\u2019s lockdowns.\nThe deal brokered by the UK at Glasgow includes commitments from dozens of developing as well as developed countries to stop using coal, and more than 100 financial institutions and other organisations have also agreed to stop financing coal development.\nThe deal came as part of a focus on energy for the fifth day of the Cop26 summit, and follows a spate of previous announcements earlier in the week, such as a commitment from scores of countries to halt deforestation. Also on Wednesday:\nMore than 20 governments and financial institutions, including the UK, US and Denmark, agreed to phase out overseas finance for all fossil fuels.\nResearch showed that the world could be on track to limit global heating to 1.9C, if commitments from India and other countries on greenhouse gas emissions are fulfilled.\nData seen by the Guardian revealed fossil fuel companies were using the energy charter treaty to sue governments for the losses they incur from national commitments to decarbonise.\nIreland was told it would need to cull 1.3m animals to meet climate targets.\nThe UK chancellor, Rishi Sunak, told the Cop26 conference London would become a global hub for net zero investment.\nThe suite of announcements on coal is a key pillar of the UK\u2019s strategy for Cop26. Leading figures acknowledged to the Guardian before the two-week conference began that the core aim \u2013 of getting countries to produce national emissions-cutting plans that would add up to a halving of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, compared with 2010 levels, which scientists say is needed to stay within 1.5C \u2013 would not be fulfilled.\nSo in order to close the gap between countries\u2019 headline carbon-cutting commitments and the 45% reduction in emissions needed, part of the UK\u2019s strategy is to focus on major areas of importance to the climate \u2013 \u201ccash, coal, cars and trees\u201d in the mantra espoused by Boris Johnson \u2013 that will produce key progress in tackling the climate crisis.\nMany campaigners welcomed the suite of announcements on coal, which also included a commitment by more than 20 countries \u2013 understood to include the US, as well as the UK and Denmark \u2013 to stop funding any fossil fuel development overseas by the end of 2022, and divert the estimated $8bn (\u00a35.85bn) a year saved into clean energy investment instead.\nChris Littlecott, social director at the thinktank E3G, said: \u201cThis commitment on coal is definitely a big step forward, and would have been unthinkable a year or two ago. It\u2019s a real sign of improvement.\u201d\nBut others said the move did not go far enough. Jamie Peters, director of campaigns at Friends of the Earth, said: \u201cThe key point in this underwhelming announcement is that coal is basically allowed to continue as normal for years yet. Some people may hear what the prime minister said at the opening of Cop, compare it to this, and wonder why there is such a difference between words and action. \u201d\nExpert assessments have found that for the world to stay within 1.5C, developed economies should phase out coal before 2030, rather than in the 2030s as in the deal announced on Wednesday night.\nElif G\u00fcnd\u00fczyeli, senior coal policy coordinator at the campaign group Climate Action Network Europe, said: \u201cThis is not a game-changer. A 2030 phaseout deadline should be a minimum, and this agreement doesn\u2019t have that. Coal is already expensive [compared with renewable energy] and no one wants to put money in coal any more.\u201d\nThe IEA has said all new development of fossil fuels must cease from this year, if the world is to stay within the 1.5C limit. The IEA\u2019s executive director, Fatih Birol, has also frequently called for the world to give up on coal, which produces more carbon than other sources of electricity, if the climate crisis is to be tackled.\nAlthough South Africa, Indonesia and the Philippines did not sign up to phase out coal, they agreed deals that will lead to the early retirement of many of their existing coal-fired power plans.",

He was offered a weekly slot on News Corp\u2019s new streaming service Flash, an offer he rejected.\n\u201cIt is, of course, the prerogative of any employer to make such a decision; but, given this is the case, I feel an obligation to my viewers to make some observations to avoid certain misconstructions,\u201d Jones wrote on Facebook.\n\u201cIn all my broadcasting life, the ratings performances have been scrutinised. I have no problem with that.\u201d\nJones then presented hundreds of words about his performance on pay TV and social media, arguing that he had a big impact across platforms.\n\u201cAgain, my Facebook page\u2019s average engagement rate per page is vastly superior to that of Sky News Australia\u2019s Facebook page,\u201d he said.\nJones has been unable to replicate the success he enjoyed as Sydney\u2019s No 1 breakfast radio presenter over several decades. He started at Sky on a high of 109,000 in July last year but then settled into a pattern of bouncing between highs in the 60,000 and lows in the 30,000.\nOn Wednesday night Bolt had 72,000 viewers while Jones had 65,000, but he went as low as 40,000 last month. The top subscription television program on the Wednesday was Foxtel\u2019s Gogglebox Australia, with 156,000 viewers.\nJones was the first significant hire by the network\u2019s chief executive Paul Whittaker, who described him as a broadcaster with \u201ca connection to his audience like no other\u201d.\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nWhittaker said on the Sky News site: \u201cRegrettably Alan has decided not to accept a new role that was offered to him for next year. We respect his decision and know he will be missed by many.\n\u201cAlan has contributed greatly to Sky News Australia over the years, advocating without fear or favour on the issues important to many Australians.\n\u201cHis compelling commentary and views on the national debate have seen him become one of the country\u2019s most successful and influential broadcasters for close to four decades.\n\u201cI\u2019d like to thank Alan for his commendable dedication and service to Sky News. We wish him well.\u201d\nJones\u2019 final program airs at 8pm on Thursday.",

        "content": "Right-back\u2019s brilliance against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid helped Anfield move on from the unsettling pre-pandemic fixture of 2020\nWas this a kind of closure? Not really. But it felt like a marker along the way.\nThis Champions League game will be remembered for two things. First, as a way of putting to bed that unsettling, unloved pre\u2011pandemic game, Liverpool versus Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, March 2020, the last dance before the shutters came down. And second for a brilliant performance from the local boy, Trent Alexander\u2011Arnold, who oozed around Anfield reeling off moments of clarity and precision, using that beautifully expressive right foot to sketch in the corners, the details, the shape of the game in a decisive first half.\nBy the final whistle at Anfield Alexander-Arnold had completed 103 passes, made five tackles and interceptions, and dished up the assists for both Liverpool goals in a 2-0 win. It was a performance of full-strength, undiluted Alexander-Arnold, a player just enjoying his own range, running up and down the scales. The result means Liverpool qualify from Group B and won\u2019t have to worry about this competition again until February. Perhaps they will move along in other ways too.\nA lot has changed in the months since these two teams last met in this stadium, a fixture that will always have its own resonance as a marker of the change from then to now. In the buildup to this game J\u00fcrgen Klopp called that night \u201creally strange\u201d. Many people present felt uneasy just being there, but with no real hard edge yet to hang that feeling on.\nThe parliamentary report into the handling of Covid-19 would later state that 37 deaths are directly linked to that fixture. What is it about football that generates these notes of sadness, among the weekly joy and trivia?\nIt was at least a reassuringly familiar return. There is a well-worn schtick about Anfield and these European nights. But just because it\u2019s a cliche doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t also true, and this is a lovely place for a night game; a stadium that leaves you a great big slice of sky, decked out with that roof-mounted dazzle that blurs the edge of your vision and gives the colours a spotlight clarity.\nThere was a lull at the start. At times like this you notice how little in the way of deeper gears there is in this version of Liverpool\u2019s midfield. What you also notice is how much of the play comes through Alexander-Arnold. In the early exchanges he was the only Liverpool player who seemed to have any kind of relationship with the ball.\nThe opening goal after 13 minutes was created by his 21st touch. It came from a fatal moment of slackness, as Mario Hermoso gave Liverpool\u2019s right-back just enough space in Trent Country, that channel by the touchline. The cross was a lovely, snaking, vicious thing, bouncing in a horrible space between defenders. Diogo Jota made just the right run and then had time to nod it into an untended spot.\nThe second goal was another Trent assist from almost the same space as he was once again oddly ignored, with time to spank a cross-shot effort across goal. Sadio Man\u00e9 diverted it into the net with the simplest of touches.\nAgain it was a goal that arrived out of no great pressure or thrust, just a moment of space and precision. This is not to play down the craft involved. If your opponent lowers his guard you still have to be able to clip his chin.\nAnd Alexander-Arnold was a joy to watch here. How do you solve a problem like Trent? There is every now and then a period of hand-wringing over this question. Why do anything? Why imagine anything needs to be done? This is not an off-the-peg footballer. He isn\u2019t trying to be an orthodox full-back.\nHis starting positions are unique, his skill set pitched differently, his brief to hurt the opposition as much as to blunt it.\nAt the same time he is a weirdly self-made kind of footballer, a fun, gangly, socks-down kind of deadly attacking weapon. He ambles. He mooches.\nWatching him charge across to close down some sniping left winger, you half expect to look down and notice he\u2019s got a surfboard under his arm. But he also he carries a presence now, and a sense of his qualities. To pick him in your team is to decide to play a certain way. Alexander\u2011Arnold is a tactic. Just go with it.\nIt still seems like a note of grace that Alexander-Arnold can exist and thrive in this sport of constant collisions and constant movement. We can talk about covering and tight defensive shape. But without Trent playing exactly like Trent this team would be hugely diminished \u2013 not just as an attacking force, but as a spectacle, as something to pore over, to become engrossed by.\nThe game turned dark toward half-time. First Felipe was sent off: a straight red flashed for a mean and cynical trip on Man\u00e9 as he broke in Liverpool\u2019s half. It wasn\u2019t vicious. But there was no effort to play the ball. Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s players were incensed. Diego Simeone could be seen stalking his touchline like a wraith, stamping his dinky patent leather lace-ups, swishing his frightening designer death-quilt coat.\nLiverpool held on to 2-0, with some minor spills. Klopp can now turn the focus of his squad to the league, with the comfort that his chief creative force looks in rude health.",

It concluded that companies were manipulating governments to take \u201cincredibly dangerous paths\u201d in their approach to climate action.\nOil giants have mounted \u201cintense resistance\u201d to Joe Biden\u2019s green agenda, according to the report, as the US president\u2019s administration attempted to shift the country away from fossil fuels.\nThe report was published on Thursday before talks at the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow to accelerate the transition from fossil fuels to clean energy. It also came a week after ExxonMobil\u2019s chief executive, Darren Woods, was accused of lying to the US Congress when he denied that the company had covered up its own research about oil\u2019s contribution to the climate crisis.\nThe report said corporate lobbying tactics in part explained why regulators in some countries such as Australia have struggled to build support for more ambitious climate policy in the lead-up to Cop26 and were increasingly viewed as \u201ca road block in global negotiations\u201d.\nToyota was the worst-ranked carmaker and the third overall in the report, which drew from more than 50,000 of pieces of evidence, covering hundreds of the world\u2019s most significant firms and trade groups, to analyse corporate climate lobbying activities.\nThe report put Toyota among some of the worst polluting companies in the world because of its opposition to phase out deadlines for fossil fuel and hybrid vehicles.\nEd Collins, a director at InfluenceMap, said it was clear that the transition to a clean energy future would remain extremely challenging until governments took meaningful action to tackle \u201cthe obstructive and anti-science lobbying of vested interests from fossil fuel value chain sectors\u201d.\n\u201cThe corporate playbook for holding back climate policy has come a long way from science denialism but it is every bit as damaging,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we are seeing is not limited to efforts to undermine regulations directly. It also involves prolific and highly sophisticated narrative capture techniques, leading governments down incredibly dangerous paths.\u201d\nThe thinktank\u2019s report noted a strong shift among many fossil fuels companies towards pro-gas lobbying and away from coal. This includes lobbying from BP, which was ninth on the global list, the Austrian energy company OMV, which was 10th, and the Russian state-owned gas giant Gazprom, which was 17th.\nA spokesperson for Exxon said: \u201cThere are competing views about how best to address the risks of climate change. ExxonMobil supports certain climate policies and opposes others. But it would be a mistake to equate such policy disagreements with promotion of climate \u2018disinformation.\u2019\u201d\nChevron and Toyota were also contacted for comment.",

        "content": "Retailer launches ad a week earlier than usual after surge in online searches for festive products\n Unexpected Guest: this alien girl is here to ravage our planet!\nJohn Lewis is returning to a tried-and-tested formula of unusual friends sharing Christmas for this year\u2019s festive ad, with an alien stepping in where a dragon, penguin and monster under the bed have gone before.\nFor more than a decade John Lewis\u2019s festive ad has become a big annual TV moment that kicks off the Christmas shopping season. This year it has launched a week earlier than usual after a rise in searches for Christmas products on the department store\u2019s websites, as shoppers try to dodge supply problems in the run-up to the big day.\nIts campaigns \u2013 from the Hare and the Bear in 2013 to Monty the Penguin in 2014 and 2019\u2019s Excitable Edgar the dragon \u2013 generally call on cute characters that draw millions of viewers online.\nAfter last year\u2019s effort, which featured a montage of quirky animations about kindness and giving to charity, rather than giving presents, and a misfiring ad for insurance, this year\u2019s festive promo features more products than ever \u2013 all of which will be highlighted at the department store\u2019s online shop and social media.\nThe back-to-Christmas-basics ad, set to a soundtrack of the 1985 Philip Oakey and Giorgio Moroder hit Together in Electric Dreams reworked by the 20-year-old singer Lola Young, sets the tone for the season as retailers dream of a return to normal after last year\u2019s high street lockdowns in November and December.\nA magical mood is also picked up by Marks & Spencer and Boots, which both launch their TV ads on Thursday.\nM&S, which is returning to promoting its clothing on the small screen after a break in 2020, has gone for a traditional ad inspired by the heyday of musicals such as Singin\u2019 in the Rain and Busby Berkeley\u2019s 1930s showgirls. A separate food ad includes an animated Percy Pig and a fairy voiced by the comedian Dawn French.\nBoots goes for a magical world where it is possible to splurge on presents and dance at parties before hugging your gran.\nRetailers and brands are expected to spend almost \u00a31bn more marketing their products this festive season than last year, in a return of the annual big-budget Christmas advertising battle.\nCharlotte Rogers, the features editor at the trade journal Marketing Week, said John Lewis\u2019s ad reflected a yearning for something comforting and familiar after more than a year of pandemic.\n\u201cLast year felt so tough and different [brands] didn\u2019t know what tone to strike and if they would be around [for Christmas],\u201d she said.\nThis year, she said, \u201ca lot of brands are doing stuff in the digital space but they know that if they want eyeballs they have to be on TV. They want to get back to normality\u201d.\nJohn Lewis\u2019s two-minute ad, entitled Unexpected Guest, will be launched in an email to loyalty cardholders at 6.30am on Thursday before hitting the department store\u2019s website and social media channels at 8am, and getting its first TV airing at 8.15pm during The Pride of Britain Awards on ITV.\nInterest was kicked off this week with an installations on South Bank in London and in Newcastle featuring an apparently crashed spacecraft and a sign saying \u201cChristmas is landing 04/11/21 #UnexpectedGuest\u201d.\nThe TV spot, created by John Lewis\u2019s usual agency Adam&eveDDB in a process taking about 10 months, features a teenage romance as Nathan finds an alien, Skye, who has crash landed her star-shaped craft in his local woods and introduces her to the delights of Christmas, including mince pies, festive knitwear and fairy lights.\nAll those items, and almost everything else in the ad, apart from the alien and her ship, will be on sale at John Lewis: from the bobble hat worn by Nathan as he heads into the woods after spotting Skye\u2019s ship from a bus window, to the baubles his family put on the tree at home.\nA 10% share of the profits from sales of a Christmas jumper featured in the ad \u2013 albeit without the additional lights shown on screen \u2013 will go to FareShare and Home-Start UK, the same charities that benefited from last year\u2019s Give a Little Love campaign.\nThe company said it had spent the same amount as usual, although it would be running a single-brand campaign this year after two years of teaming up with its sister retailer, Waitrose supermarket. Waitrose\u2019s ad will launch at a later date.\nThe campaign will include a Snapchat filter that creates space traveller selfies and an online game, as well as areas in stores to take pictures alongside replicas of Skye\u2019s spacecraft.\nClaire Pointon, the customer director at John Lewis, said: \u201cAfter the last 18 months, we wanted our advert to really celebrate this as we look forward to a brighter future. We know our customers are excited for this festive season more than ever, as they reconnect with family and friends.\u201d\nShe said the latest ad was more about \u201cmoments\u201d rather than giving gifts and had tried to broaden its appeal to a family audience by featuring teenagers for the first time.\n\u201cYou have got to think about where to push advertising when you have something that has been around for 10 years. You have got to start moving forward but in a way that customers have loved before,\u201d she said.",

Opening arguments in the high-profile case are set to begin on Friday.\nArbery, a 25-year-old Black man, was killed while out jogging in the coastal town of Satilla Shores, Georgia. None of the men involved were charged until eyewitness footage was made public months later, shortly before the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis, prompting widespread protests.\nJury selection for the case has lasted for 11 days, and lawyers were initially given a pool of 48 potential jurors, 12 of whom were Black. But defense lawyers for the accused murderers, Gregory McMichael, 67, his 35-year-old son Travis McMichael and their neighbor William \u201cRoddie\u201d Bryan, 52, struck all but one of them from the final jury.\nProsecutors had urged Judge Timothy Walmsley, who is overseeing the trial in south Georgia, to reverse the strikes of eight Black potential jurors, whom they said had been intentionally targeted over race. A landmark 1986 US supreme court decision in Batson v Kentucky ruled it unconstitutional for potential jurors to be struck solely based on race or ethnicity.\nBut Walmsley, while acknowledging the apparent \u201cintentional discrimination\u201d, cited limitations spelled out in the supreme court precedent and pointed to defense lawyers\u2019 justifications, which did not mention race or ethnicity.\nGlynn county, Georgia, where the trial is taking place and where Arbery was killed, is 26% Black and 69% white.\nArbery was shot dead in February 2020 when the three men pursued him while he was out on a run, claiming they suspected his involvement in a series of burglaries in the neighborhood. Arbery had been recorded on surveillance footage entering and leaving a semi-constructed house in the town that day, but no evidence has linked him to any offense.\nThe McMichaels, both carrying firearms, attempted to corner Arbery in a roadway using their pickup truck. Travis McMichael then fired three times with a shotgun.\nAll three men have pleaded not guilty to murder and will argue they were acting in self-defense and were legally justified in pursuing Arbery due to a now defunct citizen\u2019s arrest law.\nOn Wednesday, representatives for the Arbery family expressed outrage at the racial makeup of the jury.\n\u201cHow did we get to this result?\u201d said Barbara Arnwine, a spokeswoman for the Arbery family who was speaking outside the courthouse flanked by Marcus Arbery, Ahmaud\u2019s father. \u201cThe one thing we know is that the Black jurors who showed up for service came hoping to serve if selected. They had the same concerns as the white jurors.\u201d\nShe continued: \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing to hear the bases that were articulated by the defendants for striking the Black jurors because my mind kept going from white juror to white juror who met the precise parameters that they were describing for omitting Black jurors.\u201d\nAs well as the state criminal charges, the three accused men face federal hate crimes and attempted kidnap charges in a separate case brought by the US justice department. Their federal trial is due to start in February 2022.",

Traditional healers use that juice as drink for their patients. Sometimes they also use the leaves to rub on a person who is unwell or apply it to a wound that needs healing,\u201d said Molimau-Samasoni, adding that traditional medicine runs in her family.\n\u201cI grew up with my maternal grandmother and she was a traditional healer,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen she passed away, she passed on her treatments to me so I\u2019m now kind of a traditional healer myself.\u201d\nMolimau-Samasoni acknowledged there was a lot of scepticism and hesitancy shown toward traditional medicine.\n\u201cThe challenge between modern medicine and traditional medicine is the instances where people focus on just one type of medicine before seeking the other, so a case where people seek anti-cancer treatments from traditional healers but then present to the hospital later on with stage four cancer, when it\u2019s too late for modern medicine to do anything\u201d she said.\n\u201cAnd so I know many people think traditional medicine is just people mashing leaves together and that people are taking it just for the placebo effect, but you need to remember that traditional medicine has made significant contributions to the world of modern pharmaceuticals, examples of which include aspirin.\u201d\nAs for matalafi, Molimau-Samasoni said it would likely be years before it is available as an approved medicine but said she also believes it is just the beginning, not only for matalafi, but for broader research into how Samoa\u2019s traditional medicines could be used today.\n\u201cI believe we\u2019ve just started to unravel the potential of matalafi. But there\u2019s also honestly hundreds of other traditional medicines here in Samoa to research,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWe now have a laboratory dedicated to anti-microbial benefits in traditional medicines, a laboratory looking into anti-diabetes activity in traditional medicines and a laboratory looking into anti-cancer activity in traditional medicines. We are only just getting started.\u201d",

The best part is, it\u2019s for everyone \u2013 and also offers a wealth of health and sexual health benefits!\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for us all to work towards normalising sex-positive messages about masturbation to reduce associated feelings of shame and fear, and improve overall sexual health and literacy.\u201d\nThis article includes content provided by Facebook.

I wonder when all the funny comments will reach a climax?\u201d\nAn article accompanying the Facebook post linked to peer-reviewed research that has found a correlation between masturbation and positive body image in women, and that orgasms may help reduce menstrual cramping.\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nIt also provided recommendations for how to broach the subject with young people.\nA Queensland Health spokesperson told Guardian Australia the aim of the post was to reduce the stigma associated with masturbation, communicate the health benefits, and share advice to parents on how to talk to their children.\n\u201cSince masturbation is often considered a taboo subject and this is the first time we have spoken about it on social media, our team was prepared for the large public response and for people to be shocked.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s been great to see that the majority of responses have been positive, and that it is generating healthy conversation,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\u201cWe also wanted to encourage healthy conversations between our younger followers because we know talking about masturbation naturally flows into conversations on sexual health, self-care and consent.\u201d\n\u201cResearch shows the majority of young people get their sexual health information from online sources and feel shame and embarrassment when talking about masturbation and sex with friends and family. Unfortunately, many of these online sources are unreliable and aren\u2019t reviewed or created by experts clinicians.\u201d\nAccording to 2014 data from the Australian Study of Health and Relationships, conducted once a decade, 72% of men and 42% of women reported masturbating in the previous year.\nThe study\u2019s lead author, Prof Juliet Richters, said the sex differences in masturbation prevalence and frequency were consistent across many studies.\nThe research found masturbation was relatively uncommon among younger women, a \u201cdisappointing\u201d finding \u201cas it is generally agreed to have benefits for women in learning about their own bodies and negotiating more rewarding sexual practice with partners.\u201d\nRichters, an honorary professor in sexual health at the University of New South Wales, said: \u201cThe idea that masturbation is in some way wrong or bad for you \u2013 it\u2019s decades since that has no longer been thought by anyone in health or medicine.\u201d",

Over the past three decades their numbers have taken off. \u201cVery quickly they\u2019ve adapted to exploiting the urban environment,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve done it well. Maybe too well.\u201d\nNow the tip turkeys are considered pests, as they compete with other native species, spread disease, and fly into planes.\n\u201cI think people find them intimidating,\u201d Stow said.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s got something to do with its beady stare and its long curved beak. They strut around and gleam at you out of one eye, size up your sandwich while you\u2019re eating.\u201d\nSo they are being culled, their nests destroyed, or their eggs \u201coiled\u201d to kill the chicks inside, even while they are in \u201cserious decline\u201d in the Murray-Darling Basin, Stow said.\nThe team decided to work out whether the declining inland population could be replenished by tree-changer urban birds, so they tested feather samples, compared the genetic material, and found out that they are still similar enough to be considered one population.\nIf wetlands were regenerated and the city rubbish buffet reduced, the bin chickens could return to their natural home and boost the dwindling populations there.\nStow says if the two bird gangs instead became more divided over time, they could mutate to become distinct groups, with different genetic variants in different regions.\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\n\u201cWe were musing over whether they might,\u201d Stow said. \u201cFor plenty of species that have moved into urban environments, the evidence is emerging that there are selective processes. It\u2019ll probably happen to the Australian white ibis.\u201d\nThe much-maligned bin chickens could get even more \u201cenormously beaky\u201d, he joked.\nDespite the Australian version being despised by many (thousands of people registered for an International Glare at Ibises Day in Sydney in 2016), others are quite fond of the picnic pirate.\nThe South Australian health department used it to highlight the need for social distancing. In the past, the Australian white ibis has performed strongly in the Guardian Australia/Birdlife Australia\u2019s bird of the year awards.\nThe Australian white ibis is a native species, and a relative of the Egyptian sacred ibis, which were revered as the living incarnation of the god Thoth, who laid the cosmic egg that holds all of creation.",

These requirements had led to confrontations, Berry said.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019ve asked riders to do this, they can become quite aggressive and swear and carry on and all sorts of things,\u201d she said.\nBerry said earlier this year she arrived at a job to pick up four women. When she informed them of the capacity limit and the mask requirement, she said they abused her.\nAfter she cancelled the trip, the next day she was notified through the Uber app her account had been deactivated after someone had reported her for being \u201cviolent\u201d.\n\u201cThis, of course, was a false claim and I was horrified.\u201d\nOnce access to the app is withdrawn, Berry said it is difficult for drivers to directly contact Uber, with no phone line to contact the company, and having to deal with them over email. She said it took four or five days until her account was reactivated.\n\u201cYou\u2019re left in this position now of going \u2018is it safe to go back out there now?\u2019\u201d she said, adding it made her look for alternative work.\n\u201cMelbourne\u2019s opened up, [and] you\u2019re always you have every right to ask somebody to wear a mask and of course when any of these incidents happen you\u2019re not given any details because Uber want to protect the privacy [of] riders, so it\u2019s really frustrating.\u201d\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nA Sydney-based driver, who asked to remain anonymous due to fear of reprisal from Uber, told the committee he had \u201ca constant issue\u201d with getting riders to wear masks in his car, and had begun bringing a bag of masks with him to offer riders.\nHe said he once had his account deactivated after he gave a mask to a young man in his car who complained \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d during the ride, with the man allegedly telling Uber the driver had sworn at him.\n\u201cThat was the only incident in the day \u2013 even though I didn\u2019t know 100% \u2013 that was the only incident in the day that I could relate to as being a problem.\u201d\nHe said it took several emails before his account was restored, and said the mask mandate was also causing his customer rating to drop.\n\u201cI used to be a highly rated driver until the mask mandate came in \u2026 my rating in Uber plummeted almost overnight,\u201d he said.\n \nEmail:\u00a0sign up for our\u00a0daily morning and afternoon email newsletters\nApp:\u00a0download our free app\u00a0and never miss the biggest stories\nSocial:\u00a0follow us on YouTube,\u00a0TikTok,\u00a0Instagram,\u00a0Facebook\u00a0or\u00a0Twitter\nPodcast:\u00a0listen to our daily episodes on\u00a0Apple Podcasts,\u00a0Spotify\u00a0or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app\nBerry said her rating had also dropped because of the mask rules.\nBoth drivers said there was little recourse through the Uber app to contest claims made by customers, and no compensation from the company for the lost income while their accounts were deactivated over false claims.\nA spokesperson for Uber said the company had reintroduced phone support for drivers who have their accounts disabled in April this year, and said riders and drivers were both able to cancel trips when the other was not wearing a mask. Those who repeatedly refuse to wear masks can be blocked from the platform.\nThe company was reviewing customer and driver ratings, but indicated there had been no average change in ratings since the mask mandate came into effect.",

Putin told Frost he would not rule out joining Nato \u201cif and when Russia\u2019s views are taken into account as those of an equal partner\u201d.\nHe told Frost it was hard for him to visualise Nato as an enemy. \u201cRussia is part of the European culture. And I cannot imagine my own country in isolation from Europe and what we often call the civilised world.\u201d\nLord Robertson\u2019s comments on the One Decision podcast, which is presented by Michelle Kosinski, a former CNN journalist, and Sir Richard Dearlove, a former head of M16, underscore how Putin\u2019s worldview has evolved during his 21 years of unbroken rule of Russia.\nAfter the Orange Revolution street protests in Ukraine in 2004, Putin became increasingly suspicious of the west, which he blamed for funding pro-democracy NGOs. He was further angered by Nato\u2019s continuing expansion into central and eastern Europe: Romania, Bulgaria, Slovakia, Slovenia, Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania chose to join the alliance in 2004; Croatia and Albania followed in 2009. Georgia and Ukraine were promised membership in 2008 but have remained outside.\nRobertson also recalled how he became the first and only Nato secretary general to invoke Nato\u2019s collective defence clause, known as article five, in the wake of the 9/11 attacks.\nInvoking article five was \u201ca gamble\u201d and it was far from a foregone conclusion that Nato members would reach for it after a terrorist attack, he said, noting it was \u201cdesigned for an attack by the Soviet Union across the Fulda Gap in Germany\u201d.\nSome Nato allies were uneasy about invoking the collective defence clause to support the US, fearing it would give George W Bush\u2019s administration a licence to invade Iraq. Robertson recalled one minister asking him: \u201c\u2018Does this mean we\u2019re giving them a blank check to invade Iraq?\u2019 We said: \u2018No, it\u2019s not.\u2019\u201d\nThe Scottish former minister also revealed how the historic decision to invoke article five nearly went awry. The day after the 11 September attacks, Robertson was due to attend a routine meeting of EU foreign ministers. Anxious not to upstage the EU by calling for article five, he asked a couple of friendly foreign ministers \u2013 Jack Straw of the UK and Louis Michel of Belgium \u2013 to ask a question that gave him an opening to discuss it. But neither minister asked the question. \u201cSo I left, and afterwards there was a bit of bad blood and they said I should have announced it. But I said: \u2018Well, I was going to announce it, but nobody asked the question.\u2019\u201d\nAfter the 9/11 attacks, many Nato allies joined the US in invading Afghanistan, with Nato taking over the mission command in 2003.\nRobertson said he urged the late US defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld to keep US forces in Afghanistan alongside Nato allies after the Taliban\u2019s military defeat. He warned Rumsfeld he would denounce any US withdrawal as unacceptable. \u201cSo he [Rumsfeld] got a bit upset at that point, and I said: \u2018No, \u2026 you\u2019re not going to say we did the cooking, you can clean up the dishes.\u2019 I said: \u2018That\u2019s not it. We went in together, and we\u2019re staying in together.\u2019\u201d\nHe was critical of the US\u2019s chaotic withdrawal two months ago, but contended that the 20-year long mission of western military forces made a difference, despite the return of the Taliban. \u201cWe\u2019ve left a legacy there that these theological hoodlums are not going to be easily unravelling. And I think that Afghanistan in the future will be a very different place.\u201d",

And you know, the French have got an election coming up in April \u2013 you understand all of that posturing.\u201d\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nDutton first linked the French reaction to the looming presidential election last week, when he said \u201cpoliticians and elections make an interesting mix\u201d \u2013 although the Morrison government is also due to face voters at an election by May.\nThe French ambassador, Jean-Pierre Th\u00e9bault, alluded to Dutton\u2019s earlier comment on Wednesday, asking why Australia had jumped into \u201cthe total unknown, with so much spin, spectacular marketing, but no concrete answers\u201d.\n\u201cMaybe, as mentioned by a prominent and knowledgable Australian specialist, there were then elections looming,\u201d the ambassador said, while also arguing the Australian government had intentionally deceived France.\nDutton played down Th\u00e9bault\u2019s remarks, saying the ambassador was \u201creading from a script from Paris\u201d after being recalled for consultations in September.\nDutton said the ambassador had \u201ca job to do\u201d but it was important for France and Australia to work closely together because of strategic challenges in the Indo-Pacific.\n\u201cThe Communist party of China has taken a particular course and we need to all work together to make sure that we have peace and stability in our region,\u201d Dutton said.\n\u201cAny blip in relation to that, any concern, hurt feelings, frankly, needs to be put aside for us to concentrate on the bigger issue, which is making sure that we protect and defend our country.\u201d\nSenior Australian ministers have defended the release of the Macron text \u2013 linking it to the French president\u2019s own comment, \u201cI don\u2019t think, I know,\u201d when asked whether he thought Morrison had lied to him.\n\u201cThe claim was pretty extraordinary and it needed to be refuted,\u201d the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, told the Nine Network.\nMorrison insists he \u201cmade very clear\u201d to Macron over dinner in Paris in mid-June \u201cthat a conventional diesel-powered submarine was not going to meet Australia\u2019s strategic requirements\u201d.\nBut Morrison also said he wasn\u2019t at liberty at that stage to disclose to Macron that Australia was working with the US and the UK on a plan B, because it had not yet been finalised and was held \u201cin confidence\u201d.\nAukus was a key focus of a call between Australia\u2019s foreign minister, Marise Payne, and the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, on Thursday morning.\nThe pair discussed \u201cthe ways in which we will deepen our engagement with other key allies and partners in our collective efforts to uphold a free and open Indo-Pacific\u201d, the US state department said.\nChina has leapt on the diplomatic dispute to further its own criticism of Aukus.\nChina\u2019s foreign ministry spokesperson, Wang Wenbin, said: \u201cAustralia should not only give honest answers to its partner\u2019s questioning, but also honestly face up to the international community\u2019s concerns, earnestly fulfil its non-proliferation obligations, and stop such irresponsible behaviour as creating bloc confrontation and proliferation risks.\u201d",

This is the second brown hare I have seen in the last two weeks. The first was deep in a shadowy wood on the edge of East Anglia, where it was so dark that the animal appeared black. It sat up on its haunches watching me, long ears silhouetted against the dim light filtering through the trees.\nThe Dorset hare was in a wind-blown meadow where rough strips of grass have been left uncut to provide cover. It drew my eye by bolting along the hedge, hind legs pistoning, jinking as it ran. Normally they are almost invisible, until they move, and spend most of the daylight hours crouching in small depressions in the grass, known as forms.\nBrown hares (Lepus europeaeus) came to Britain from across the North Sea during the iron age, more than 2,000 years ago. There is evidence that they were used for divinatory practices \u2013 most famously, the one that Boudicca kept in the folds of her cloak and released before battle as an augury.\u00a0It was thought that the direction the hare ran indicated the\u00a0course of victory.\nWhile hare numbers are in decline nationally, they have been slowly increasing here in the vale. Changes in land management practices have created better habitats, especially as several farms have abandoned intensive dairy production and the relentless spring silage cutting that entails.\nDisease is the main challenge now to these solitary nocturnal creatures. Hares across the UK have been dying from mysterious new viral illnesses, including a form of hepatitis more commonly found in rabbits. I saw the body of one victim last summer, hidden among tall, bitter clumps of artemisia, stretched out as if in full sprint. Professor Diana Bell at the University of East Anglia, based in the species\u2019 regional stronghold, is currently investigating the causes of\u00a0this mass die-off.\nI walk on, pondering the invisible lines of species connection running from Dorset in the west to the black hare in the east on the edge of Boudicca\u2019s territory, home to the research project that might help them survive this latest fight.\n Country Diary is on Twitter at @gdncountrydiary"

        "content": "Intelligence committee chief Adam Schiff says US and allies must make it clear to China \u2018what a significant cost it would pay were it to use force\u2019 \nAdam Schiff, the US chair of the influential House intelligence committee, has called for the US to be less ambiguous about its defence plans for Taiwan, amid Pentagon warnings that China\u2019s military has made stunning advances.\nSpeaking at the Aspen Security Forum, Schiff, a leading Democrat, said the US and its international partners needed \u201cto make it abundantly clear to China what a significant cost it would pay were it to use force to try to invade and take over Taiwan\u201d.\n\u201cWe need to be much clearer about our obligation to defend Taiwan,\u201d he said.\nAlso speaking at the forum, the US chair of the joint chiefs of staff, General Mark Milley, said strategic ambiguity was the right policy, but warned China\u2019s military was making stunning technological advances, citing the recent reported hypersonic missile test, but he didn\u2019t expect any hostile action in the next two years.\n\u201cHaving said that, though, the Chinese are clearly and unambiguously building the capability to provide those options to the national leadership if they so choose at some point in the future,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe are witnessing one of the largest shifts in global geostrategic power that the world has witnessed.\u201d\nThe comments from Schiff and Milley come amid heightened concern over China\u2019s plans for Taiwan, and speculation about an attack ranging from within a few years to decades away. In recent days, China\u2019s military was forced to dispel rumours of an impending war.\nThe US has for decades held a deterrent policy of strategic ambiguity, refusing to confirm or deny if it would come to Taiwan\u2019s military defence in the event of an attack by China.\nBut analysts and officials are increasingly questioning the continued merit of the policy, particularly given Beijing\u2019s determination that it will take Taiwan, which it considers to be a rogue province, by force if necessary. Last month US president Joe Biden told a town hall that the US had a commitment to defend Taiwan. The comments were walked back by the White House but were widely seen as a sign of further US support.\n\u201cI think probably less ambiguity is better than more ambiguity,\u201d Schiff said on Wednesday, but added there was a \u201cfine line\u201d when talking about it. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to make any pronouncement that will accelerate Chinese thinking or timetable in terms of using military force against Taiwan,\u201d he said.\nMilley said that there was \u201cno question\u201d the US had the capability to defend Taiwan.\nIn recent years China has ratcheted up its military drills and air force sorties into Taiwan\u2019s air defence zone. On Thursday the latest US Pentagon assessment of China\u2019s military said it was increasing its nuclear arsenal faster than previously thought.\nDespite the concerns, there has been no pronouncement from Beijing or indication of imminent action. On Wednesday, China\u2019s military was forced to issue statements debunking fake text messages asking reservists to be prepared for drafting because tensions were so severe. A People\u2019s Liberation Army-linked social media account said the texts, which told recipients to be \u201cready to fight\u201d, were \u201cmalicious fabrications\u201d and would be investigated.\nPanic was also fuelled by unsubstantiated claims that Taiwanese were stockpiling, and unrelated warnings from China\u2019s commerce ministry that people should stockpile essentials because of extreme weather-related food shortages.\n\u201cMy mother was particularly worried today and said that China is going into a war with Taiwan,\u201d said one Chinese Weibo user. \u201cI told her don\u2019t worry. Where did the rumour come from? I found out that my colleagues\u2019 mothers had said the same thing. The source was TikTok.\u201d\nTaiwan\u2019s government maintains it is already a sovereign nation and has no wish for conflict or unification with China.\nIt is gaining significant support from foreign governments and representatives. On Wednesday a delegation of European Union parliamentarians arrived in Taiwan, including members who had been sanctioned by China over the advocacy against rights abuses in Xinjiang.\nAt an event on Thursday the delegation leader, Rapha\u00ebl Glucksmann, told Taiwan\u2019s president Tsai Ing-wen they came with a simple message: \u201cYou are not alone. Europe is standing with you, by you, in the defence of freedom, rule of law.\u201d",

        "content": "Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao has gone from importing fax machines as a student in Moscow to name-changing billionaire\nNguyen Thi Phuong Thao began her business career as a sideline importing fax machines and latex rubber into the then Soviet Union while studying economic management at D Mendeleev University of Chemical Technology in Moscow. Before she had turned 21 \u2013 or graduated \u2013 she had made her first million.\nPhuong Thao, who is popularly known as Madam Thao, is now Vietnam\u2019s first and only female billionaire with an estimated $2.7bn (\u00a32bn) fortune made from VietJet, the airline she founded and runs, alongside a vast property empire that stretches from skyscrapers in Ho Chi Minh City to five star beach resorts across the country as well as offshore oil and gas exploration and fossil fuel financing.\nBut her name may soon be well known in the UK as well as Vietnam after University of Oxford\u2019s Linacre College agreed to rename itself Thao College after a \u00a3155m \u201ctransformative donation\u201d from her holding company Sovico Group.\n\u201cEducation and research are the keys to the development and prosperity of mankind,\u201d she said on announcing the deal. \u201cI believe the long-term cooperation with Oxford University will bring new opportunities and good value to the community.\u201d\nThe 51-year-old, who signed the deal with Linacre College\u2019s principal Prof Nick Brown in the presence of the Vietnamese prime minister, Ph\u1ea1m Minh Ch\u00ednh, in Edinburgh in the run-up to the Cop conference, is no stranger to Oxford\u2019s spires.\nHer son, Tommy Nguyen, studied economic management at Oxford, where he followed in his mother\u2019s footsteps by also setting up a sideline company. He founded the logistics firm Swift247, which transports documents from south-east Asia to the rest of the world, after he struggled to get his visa paperwork sent to the UK quickly enough to change schools. In the end his family sent a member of staff to personally courier the documents to him in London.\nIn his application to study at Oxford, he is said to have written \u201cmy mother is a role model for me to strive to follow\u201d.\nPhuong Thao has spoken of the difficulty of building her empire while raising her two children at the same time. \u201cHe [Tommy] kept insisting and begging [me] to take him to class,\u201d she told the Vietnamese business website Cafebiz. \u201cStrictly, I had a meeting at 8:30. [I told him] go alone, even though my heart wants to go with you.\u201d\nShe said she would prefer not to live life in the public eye. \u201cBut business leadership has turned me into a person of the collective, of the public. I must always be aware of the exemplary spirit of leadership, sharing among staff and I am forced to sacrifice my privacy and interests.\u201d\nNonetheless, Phuong Thao has a habit of courting controversy to boost sales. In 2012 Vietjet promoted a new flight with beauty pageant contestants walking the aisles in bikinis. The airline, which now flies to more than 120 destinations, was fined 20m dong (\u00a3600) for the Hawaiian-themed stunt that violated aviation regulations.\nDespite the fine, bikini-clad airline employees also welcomed home the national under-23 football team after they lost the final of the 2018 Asian Football Confederation Championship.\nThe incident prompted customers to ask Phuong Thao: \u201cDo you want to rename Vietjet \u2018Vietsex\u2019?\u201d The airline was fined a further 40m dong by the Civil Aviation Authority of Vietnam (CAAV). Undeterred, Phuong Thao wants to expand Vietjet to become the \u201cEmirates of Asia\u201d.\nShe has \u201calways aimed big and done big deals\u201d. \u201cI have never done anything on a small scale,\u201d she said of her university sideline. \u201cWhen people were trading one container [of goods], I was already trading hundreds of containers.\u201d\nThe donation to Linacre, which was named after the Renaissance humanist, medical scientist Thomas Linacre whom the college has described as \u201cone of the great scholars of his time\u201d, is the largest donation given to Oxford in at least 500 years.\nHer \u00a3155m pips the previous modern-day record of \u00a3150m given by the US billionaire private equity tycoon Stephen Schwarzman in 2019 to fund a new humanities and performance space, to be called the Schwarzman Centre.\nIt is not the first time Oxford buildings or colleges have been renamed after donors. Harris Manchester college changed its name from Manchester College in 1996 after a donation from businessman Lord Harris.\nThe financier Wafic Sa\u00efd donated \u00a370m in 1996, most of which went to the establishment of the Sa\u00efd Business School. Len Blavatnik, Ukraine-born billionaire and UK\u2019s richest person, according to the Sunday Times, donated \u00a375m to the university in 2015 for the construction of the Blavatnik School of Government.\nLinacre, which has already faced a barrage of criticism from academics for accepting the money and allowing the \u201ccommercialisation\u201d of great seats of learning, said it was delighted to accept the donation as it has \u201clong been one of the least well-endowed colleges at the university\u201d with just \u00a317.7m in the bank.\nSovico\u2019s role in various offshore oil and gas projects in the Vietnam basin has also angered the Oxford University Climate Justice Campaign, which said: \u201cWe are sad to hear what Linacre\u2019s actions have told us: that Linacre values money more than people and the planet.\u201d\nPhuong Thao and the college had anticipated that criticism. As part of the deal, Sovico has committed to reaching net zero emissions by the end of 2050 \u2013 and says it will draw on input from Oxford academics to achieve that goal.",

        "content": "Dwayne Johnson, Gal Gadot and a spectacularly annoying Ryan Reynolds quip, steal and double-cross in a disposable, and ludicrously expensive, action comedy\nOne of the supposed beauties of Netflix, and all other streamers with access to such vast resources, is that without the panicked need for box office success, there\u2019s a certain freedom that\u2019s then afforded. The risks that might be deemed too precarious in the global marketplace (Too original? Too adult? Too gay?) are no longer of such prioritised concern and thus big budgets can be allocated to biggish bets. It\u2019s why Netflix was confident to take on Martin Scorsese\u2019s $160m crime saga The Irishman after Paramount deemed it too expensive and why the streamer also spent $70m to kick off the Old Guard franchise with a diverse cast and a central, uncensored queer romance. Both paid off (the films rank among the streamer\u2019s most-watched) and showed that a brave new world away from the safe repetition of homogeneous superheroes, remakes and superhero remakes might be possible.\nSo with the arrival of Red Notice, a film that allegedly cost upwards of $200m, making it Netflix\u2019s biggest budget to date, one might hope for something slightly out of the ordinary, a much-needed tweak on what a traditional studio might otherwise lazily offer. But what makes the film so maddening, along with many, many other reasons, is that it\u2019s the most boringly indistinctive patchwork job we\u2019ve seen for a long while, a beige piece of committee-approved product that slums from point A to point B to who cares. Like an increasing number of the streamer\u2019s mass-market offerings, the overriding message appears to be: see, we can make films just as badly as everyone else! So much for the great disruptor \u2026\nThe script was at one point the centre of a heated auction with all the majors jostling for rights before Universal snapped them up but down the line, there was trepidation over the expense and Netflix stepped in to give the green light instead. It\u2019s easy to see why as there\u2019s inherently safe global appeal \u2013 Dwayne Johnson, Ryan Reynolds and Gal Gadot starring in an action comedy about global heists \u2013 elements that would make this worth the investment in or outside of the lower stakes world of streaming. But while the stage is set for a sleek James Bond meets Indiana Jones meets Ocean\u2019s Eleven meets Dirty Rotten Scoundrels caper, writer-director Rawson Marshall Thurber stumbles on his way there, misfiring on every conceivable level, a film trying so hard to recall the fun of other films that it forgets to have any fun for itself.\nA red notice is a type of high-level international warrant afforded to an on-the-run-criminal, causing FBI agent John Hartley (Johnson) to track slippery art thief Nolan Booth (Reynolds) all the way to Rome. They\u2019re forced into an uneasy partnership due to some guff about three golden eggs that Cleopatra used to own and that Booth is trying to steal. He almost manages to nab the first but Hartley intervenes and sends him to a remote Russian jail, a jail where he himself then ends up after he\u2019s framed for stealing the egg by The Bishop (Gadot), another art thief eager to own them for herself. Hartley and Booth then decide to team up and take her down.\nThe megabucks assembly of A-listers (each received a reported $20m for the film) might make sense in a boardroom \u2013 combined they have a reach of almost 400 million Instagram followers and their films have made over $20bn at the global box office \u2013 but there\u2019s a vast, vibe-killing gap between what makes sense on paper and what works on screen. For a frippery such as this to fly, sky-high star power is as integral as bombastic set pieces but there\u2019s a total lack of connective chemistry between the trio, each ill-suited to their role and the territory. It\u2019s the worst, most removed algorithmic casting possible (even in Thurber\u2019s ho-hum action comedy Central Intelligence, there was a spark between Johnson and co-star Kevin Hart) and watching the three on-screen makes for an overwhelmingly flat experience. Anything sexy is made asexual, anything charming is made charmless and so what should be a smooth ride is turned into a bumpy slog.\nThe rat-a-tat back-and-forth between sworn enemies turned begrudging buddies Johnson and Reynolds is strikingly, embarrassingly unfunny and rapidly grating, thanks mostly to a spectacularly annoying turn from the latter, reheating his Deadpool and Free Guy shtick but with even less effective writing to play with. The dated pop culture references (Jurassic Park? Pulp Fiction? A Borat impression?) are as tiresome as the many schoolyard gay jokes and while one can understand the monetary appeal for them both, it feels like a career regression, remixing former glories rather than doing anything fresh. Gadot is not much help either, in a much smaller role, failing to bring any of the vampy fun required, sleepwalking through the motions, adept only when fighting. The nonsensically convoluted plot would perhaps be more forgivable if the stars were charismatic enough or the action were exciting enough but in a desperate search for something to squeeze enjoyment out of, it\u2019s left to the locations to pick up the slack, the one good use of the film\u2019s monstrous budget, whisking us around the world for some nice scenery while everything around it crumbles.\nThere\u2019s something so soulless and ineffectual about the aggressively unnecessary Red Notice that it almost plays like a pastiche of a Hollywood blockbuster, like a bot consumed the last 20 years of studio fare and spat out a facsimile as an experiment. No one expects films like this to change the game but, at the very least, they should be able to play it.\nRed Notice is out in selected cinemas from 5 November and on Netflix on 12 November",

Others are saying that the system is ripe for reform but it it needs to be stricter or to outlaw lobbying by MPs altogether.\nOstensibly, the Tory plan which emerged this week to introduce a new body for MPs to challenge decisions by the standards committee is to save Owen Paterson\u2019s bacon. The veteran backbencher was facing 30 days suspension from parliament for lobbying government bodies on behalf of firms which paid him more than \u00a3100,000 \u2013 as revealed by the Guardian two years ago.\nNo 10 argues that the plan is simply about trying to create a fair system which allows an MP the right of appeal.\nBut one Tory MP believed the motivation for a shake-up was worry in Downing Street about further standards investigations coming down the track \u2013 particularly potential inquiries into lobbying over the award of Covid contracts, and into the prime minister\u2019s loans from a Tory donor for the redecoration of his flat at No 11 Downing Street.\nFor years there have been warnings that the government has been going in the wrong direction when it comes to tackling inappropriate lobbying and transparency standards, all issues associated with the whiff of corruption and \u201cTory sleaze\u201d.\nAs recently as Monday a report by the committee on standards in public life, led by the former spy chief Jonathan Evans, argued that sweeping changes to the system were needed, particularly when it came to oversight of ministers\u2019 behaviour and lobbying by those formerly in power.\nThe report did not make any recommendations on the standards system for MPs, which is widely seen as imperfect but relatively effective, even though some would like to see the rules tightened further to ban parliamentarians\u2019 second jobs altogether.\nPaid advocacy by MPs has been banned in some form or other since 1695, according to Chris Bryant, chair of the standards committee. The ban on direct lobbying was formalised after the cash for questions scandals of the 1990s. The standards commissioner and the standards committee of MPs and independent members, have repeatedly enforced those rules when breaches, such as in the case of Paterson, have been brought to their attention.\nBut even with the prohibition in place, MPs can legitimately have second jobs advising companies on politics and policy. As an example of the revolving door, Sajid Javid, now the health secretary, was paid \u00a3150,000 a year by the investment bank JP Morgan shortly after leaving office as chancellor of the exchequer.\nThe list of Tories, in particular, with second jobs in areas of their policy expertise is long, with many former ministers now working in the sectors they used to govern. Some advise hotel chains, investment companies, property developers; one link is with a gambling firm.\nThe fine print also allows some wriggle room. MPs can engage in lobbying if it is \u201csix months after the reward or consideration was received\u201d. They are not allowed to speak in the Commons, make approaches to ministers, vote, or initiate parliamentary proceedings, in return for direct payment in cash or kind.\nHowever, they are allowed to participate in parliamentary proceedings and conversations with ministers that would financially benefit their client as long as they did not start the interaction, the interest is declared and is not for the sole benefit of their client.\nFormer ministers and public officials can also engage in lobbying just two years after leaving office, under the rules of the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba). In practice, some are suspected of doing so under the radar before then, since the watchdog for enforcing lobbying prohibitions has no power to sanction them.\nThe Greensill scandal, in which the former prime minister David Cameron pestered senior ministers for favours on behalf of his new employer, the supply chain financier Greensill Capital, shows the extent to which intensive lobbying is still permitted. An official parliamentary inquiry found Cameron showed a \u201csignificant lack of judgment\u201d but did not breach lobbying rules.\nWhile scandals about lobbying and financial interests of politicians are nothing new, a number of experts, academics \u2013 and some MPs themselves \u2013 believe standards are being further eroded under the present government. Bryant warned that the public \u201cwill think we are the parliament that sanctioned cash for questions\u201d.\nRobert Barrington, professor at the Centre for the Study of Corruption, at the University of Sussex and a former government adviser, said on Wednesday that the Paterson case only \u201cillustrates the crisis of standards that is currently undermining democracy in the UK\u201d.\nHe concluded: \u201c[It is] hard to avoid the conclusion that there is an effort to change the rules when it suits, with arguments based solely on party or tribal loyalty and not any basis of principles or standards. Perhaps that is the luxury of an 80-seat majority.\u201d\nDaniel Bruce, chief executive of Transparency International, also said the \u201cdirection of travel\u201d had to change in light of recent cases where the prime minister and government had overridden decisions by standards bodies.\nBruce said: \u201cComing into this year we have a vacuum of oversight on the ministerial code after the Priti Patel [bullying] case when the independent adviser resigned. We\u2019ve had the commission on the appointments to the upper house overruled by the prime minister when the commissioner took a view that a Conservative donor should not get a peerage. We\u2019ve got this woefully inadequate picture of lobbying of the government. We\u2019ve got a decade of decline in FoI [freedom of information] requests being granted in full. Those are four very concerning areas.\n\u201cAnd yet what do we have this week? We now have government-backed attempts to dismantle a system of oversight set up in the height of 1990s sleaze and further strengthened after the MPs expenses saga of 2009 \u2026 The very obvious timing of this proposed review to suspend a suspension suggests this is very partisan.\u201d\nBruce said Transparency International had monitored suspected breaches of parliamentary conduct rules and the ministerial code, finding 30 breaches that were not investigated or where no action was taken in 2020.\n\u201cThe number of cases where questionable behaviour goes un-investigated has intensified in the last few years under this current administration,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is the concern, and I await with keen interest the government\u2019s full response to the committee on standards report because as far as I am concerned there is no turning away from that.\u201d",

        "content": "Among under-18s, vaccine uptake is low, and there is a growing issue with misinformation spread on social media and at school. Is there anything a concerned caregiver can do?\nThroughout the pandemic, Anna has worked for the NHS. She has seen the effects of Covid-19 first-hand and, although she worked remotely because she was in a vulnerable group, other colleagues \u2013 she is a physiotherapist \u2013 were deployed to Covid wards at the height of hospital admissions. \u201cAt the trust I work for, they\u2019re setting up a long-Covid service,\u201d she says. She comes home and her son Sam, 16, listens to her talk about it \u2013 and yet he is adamant that the coronavirus isn\u2019t happening or that, if it is, it\u2019s not serious. \u201cYou know: \u2018Covid is a load of rubbish \u2013 it\u2019s all about control\u2019,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s all very conspiracy theory, a lot of his stuff.\u201d He was adamant from the start that he wouldn\u2019t be having the vaccine if and when it became available for his age group, and he has stuck to it. \u201cHe is very resistant,\u201d says Anna. \u201cHe is pretty determined not to conform anyway. Part of it, I think, is him being a teenager, and the other bit of it is conspiracy theory: \u2018It\u2019s all a big con.\u2019\u201d His main source of information since the start of the pandemic has been social media, says Anna. \u201cHe watches a lot of YouTube.\u201d\nJust over a month ago, YouTube announced it would remove videos that spread misinformation about all vaccines, and would ban the accounts of anti-vax activists; it had already banned content with false claims about Covid vaccines last year. Facebook did the same in February this year, though a quick search reveals misinformation is still easy to find (one post I found within minutes claimed 80% of vaccinated women had miscarriages). On TikTok, \u201cunvaxxed\u201d content racks up hundreds of thousands of views. Last month, NewsGuard, an organisation that rates the credibility of news organisations and monitors misinformation, found Covid conspiracy theories were being viewed by millions on TikTok, and, in its research, children under 13 \u2013 the lower age limit \u2013 were able to access the app.\nEven if children have avoided anti-vaccine misinformation on social media, they may have come across it at the school gate. There have been demonstrations outside schools across the UK; some protesters have loudhailers, and give alarming leaflets to children, or point them in the direction of websites with misinformation. At least one school was targeted by protesters showing images of what appeared to be dead children, falsely claiming they had been killed by the vaccine, which unsurprisingly distressed children. The Association of School and College Leaders union found nearly 80% of British schools had been targeted in some way \u2013 mainly emails threatening legal action \u2013 and 13% had reported seeing anti-vax demonstrators directly outside the school gates; 18 schools said protesters had actually got inside.\nIn September, the UK\u2019s chief medical officers recommended children between the ages of 12 and 15 be offered a single dose of a Covid vaccine, to join the 16- and 17-year-olds, who have been offered a jab since August. So far about 21% of 12- to 15-year-olds in England have had the vaccine; for the older age group, 56% have come forward. There are many reasons for the relatively low uptake \u2013 and it was always expected to be lower for children than much older people \u2013 such as issues with the rollout. In Scotland \u2013 where children are largely vaccinated in drop-in centres, rather than schools \u2013 take-up is about 53% in the 12- to 15-year-old age group.\nBut there is also hesitancy. In a survey of nearly 28,000 pupils in England, published at the end of September, researchers found 51% of 13-year-olds were willing to have the vaccine, compared with 78% of 17-year-olds. For nine-year-olds, the figure drops to 36% (while no vaccine has been approved for under-12s in the UK, last week, regulators in the US last week approved Pfizer\u2019s vaccine for children over the age of five).\nWhen Lily, 13, had her vaccine at school, she was one of only about five from her class of 30 to have it. None of her close friends did. \u201cWe had conversations about it, when we were trying to make up our minds about what we would do,\u201d she says. \u201cThey would tell me their reasons about why they didn\u2019t want to have it, like they\u2019d seen online about people having seizures when you get it. And also there was stuff about the vaccine making you infertile, and just making you very ill as well, apparently.\u201d They showed her videos they had seen on social media, mostly on TikTok.\n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely a kind of feeling of: \u2018Oh, maybe it\u2019s not a good idea then. Why am I the only one who thinks it\u2019s a good idea to get it?\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cI made, like, 10 different decisions. The night before, I decided I wasn\u2019t going to get it. I ended up changing my mind because I researched it.\u201d\nLily had spoken to her parents about having the vaccine, and although she says they didn\u2019t put any pressure on her either way, \u201cthey did point out some reasons why it would be a good idea to get it. I think the main reason I actually changed my mind and got the vaccine was because most of the reasons that my friends had for not getting the vaccine were because of themselves. But my parents\u2019 point was that the main reason I should get it is because of my grandparents and people like that.\u201d\nHesitancy doesn\u2019t mean teenagers are anti-vaxxers, says Russell Viner, a paediatrician and professor of adolescent health at the UCL Institute of Child Health, and one of the authors of the study of English pupils. \u201cThere\u2019s an element to which to hesitate and think is entirely appropriate, rather than just rushing in,\u201d he says. \u201cI think the research shows that much of the hesitancy is about a lack of information, certainly at the time [they did the survey].\u201d He has a 15-year-old, \u201cand so we\u2019re going through all of these issues. Young people are saying: \u2018Do I really need it? How much will it benefit me?\u2019 I think we absolutely have to be transparent and honest in our response, which is that the chief medical officers have looked at this, and the balance of risks is in favour of vaccination but it isn\u2019t an overwhelming balance. So a level of thinking about it is appropriate in teenagers. That\u2019s the transparent, we-need-to-be-honest-about-the-science side of things.\n\u201cOn the other hand, at a population level, we want our teenagers to be vaccinated and get the vaccination levels as high as we can. I think the right thing to do is probably what the government has largely been doing, which is not making it compulsory, and being transparent about the benefits and the very unlikely and very rare risks.\u201d\nOn balance, he says, \u201cit\u2019s the right thing to do to vaccinate teenagers. But it\u2019s not an absolute no-brainer and that\u2019s why Britain didn\u2019t rush to it, unlike vaccinating over-80s. It\u2019s a much more finely balanced position.\u201d\nThis is how Clare and her 13-year-old son Jamie felt about it. Most of her family has been vaccinated (Clare wasn\u2019t because of underlying conditions), but Jamie is sure that he won\u2019t have the vaccine, and Clare supports his decision. \u201cWhat influenced it was the JCVI report that didn\u2019t recommend the vaccines for healthy children,\u201d she says. Initially, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation advised there were insufficient medical grounds to vaccinate healthy children between the ages of 12 and 15. And then \u201cthere was a swift turnaround from the government to suddenly say: \u2018Children under 16 will be vaccinated.\u2019\u201d The chief medical officers\u2019 decision took into account the benefits beyond the low individual health benefits, such as children losing fewer school days, and reducing transmission to older family members.\n\u201cWe\u2019d already started the conversation with our son and he was very clear that he didn\u2019t want the vaccine,\u201d says Clare. Jamie was concerned about the (very small) risk of heart inflammation, and particularly because it was found to be higher in boys \u2013 about 162 cases per million after two doses of a vaccine, compared with 13 per million in girls. \u201cThat scared him. He said: \u2018What if that happens?\u2019 And I said: \u2018It\u2019s treatable.\u2019 But he was adamant that he didn\u2019t want it. He wanted to know more about it, he wanted there to be a longer time of knowing what the vaccine might do \u2013 those were his words. That isn\u2019t to say we can\u2019t change our minds.\u201d\nShe is sure he hasn\u2019t been influenced by social media, as he has tight restrictions on his phone, and since he is home-educated, in preparation for taking up a place at a specialist school, she doesn\u2019t think he has been exposed to much, if any, anti-vax misinformation. \u201cWe\u2019ve talked about what anti-vax is,\u201d says Clare. \u201cIn the home education community, I suppose it won\u2019t surprise you, there\u2019s lots of anti-vaxxers, but they\u2019re not our tribe. Politically, we wouldn\u2019t be in that group.\u201d\nViner is concerned about online anti-vax messages, and says he is \u201cappalled\u201d at the school protests. \u201cIt\u2019s irresponsible to target young people coming out of schools when they\u2019re not with their parents; they\u2019re being given information that they may not seek, that\u2019s being pushed at them. I think that\u2019s reprehensible behaviour by anybody.\u201d\nSocial media, he points out, has given voice to an anti-vax agenda in general, not just Covid vaccines. \u201cI think what we\u2019ve seen is very strategic use of social media by those opposed to vaccination, and young people are part of that. Because they\u2019re high consumers of social media, you could argue that they\u2019re more vulnerable. However, I think, most young people, because they\u2019re high consumers of social media, are pretty savvy about what they read. There is a worry, but I think we should also be reassured that young people frequently show relatively high ability to recognise when unsupported \u2018facts\u2019 are being pushed. But that\u2019s not always true.\u201d\nThis, says Anna, is what she believes her son has been exposed to online. Incorrect information, she says, is \u201ca huge concern. Teenagers are really impressionable, despite the fact that he\u2019d argue that he wasn\u2019t.\u201d Does she challenge him about it? \u201cYes. I say: \u2018How can you argue against something that\u2019s blatantly happening?\u2019 We have open dialogue, and I just say that this is what I know, and what I understand. But he says the research is rubbish.\u201d She knows the risk to him from a Covid infection is very low, but the concern is there. \u201cI\u2019d be frightened if he got it in case he was one of the unlucky ones that became seriously unwell.\u201d\nWe should be thinking about the way to reach young people with good information, says Viner. \u201cThey absolutely respond to trusted advisers, such as the chief medical officers, but they also respond to peers. There are some extraordinarily powerful voices in the younger generation who are hugely respected by young people, and using those kinds of mechanisms to reach young people would also be helpful.\u201d Again, he stresses that he doesn\u2019t believe young people are particularly hardline anti-vaxxers. \u201cThe hesitancy [in the research] was mostly \u2018don\u2019t knows\u2019, rather than teenagers who were strongly anti. And I think the message from young people was: \u2018Convince us. Give us the information.\u2019 My son said to me: \u2018I\u2019ll have the vaccine if you tell me it\u2019s the right thing to do and it helps my life go back to normal.\u2019\u201d\nFor Anna and Sam, their exchanges are largely good-natured, she says, although he can become \u201ca bit loud and more defiant\u201d when she asks about his sources for his \u201cconspiracy theories\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve said: \u2018You\u2019ve had all your vaccinations.\u2019 I\u2019ve talked about polio and MMR and all the vaccinations that he\u2019s had to keep him healthy, and that this really is no different to that. And it\u2019s about stopping other people from becoming unwell. I will keep chipping away, but I do pick my moments.\u201d For now, Sam is ignoring his invitation. \u201cI still feel optimistic,\u201d says his mother, \u201cthat at some point that he will take it up.\u201d\nNames of parents and children have been changed.",

        "content": "A new documentary shines a light on the breakthroughs that are being made or are close to being made in finding cures to previously incurable diseases\nRyan Custer was a freshman basketball player at Wright State University in Dayton, Ohio, when, in April 2017, he jumped into a pool at a house party and shattered his C5 vertebra. Paralyzed from the chest down, Custer entered a clinical trial in Chicago for an experimental stem cell therapy that could restore limited nerve function one centimeter \u2013 shoulder shrug, bicep motion, tricep use \u2013 at a time.\nCheryl Wiers, a mother in her 40s, saw her aggressive non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma return twice, with a vengeance. Chemotherapy wasn\u2019t working, but a clinical trial for a transplant of stem cells at City of Hope medical center in Duarte, California, offered hope.\nIn San Francisco, Andrew Caldwell, who is HIV-positive, underwent an experimental therapy which transfused his own genetically modified stem cells back into his body; if the modified cells produced enough HIV-resistant fighter cells, known as T-cells, to suppress the virus, the treatment could functionally cure HIV.\nAll three are vanguards on the slowly unfolding horizon of stem cell therapies, which could offer reprieve from diseases such as certain types of cancers, Type 1 diabetes, lupus and other auto-immune disorders. And all three, along with several others, offer up their emotional, idiosyncratic, and casually radical stories in the film Ending Disease, a collection of intimate portraits of experimental medicine under the culturally fraught, politically vulnerable, and extremely promising umbrella of stem cell research.\nSuch research has long been a game of potentials \u2013 treatments that could cure a host of incurable diseases or conditions, from HIV to certain causes of blindness to quadriplegia; research whose funding could get kneecapped by the whims of political power, treatments that could become available to the masses but are limited to select clinical trial groups. Ending Disease, which followed several trial participants between 2016 and 2019, takes its name from the farthest reaches of said potential: \u201cwe are on the cusp of a tremendous number of cures,\u201d said director Joe Gantz.\nFor each of the case studies in Ending Disease, stem cell treatments hold potential that is vague and unpredictable yet incalculably significant. For Rosie Barrero, who became legally blind from retinitis pigmentosa in her 20s, it\u2019s the chance to see a little more clearly, to depend on her family less. For Custer, the reclamation of any movement below the neck. For Erica Billy, the opportunity to have her toddler daughter, Ava, who was born without a functional immune system, escape isolation, go to school, and avoid the harrowing treatments \u2013 chemotherapy rounds, a bone marrow transplant \u2013 that defined her infancy.\nThe 138-minute documentary sketches the broad outline of what stem cells are \u2013 basically, blueprint cells that could become any other type of cell in the body \u2013 and a surface-level explainer of how therapies work on a scientific level. But the portraits are hyper-specific, mundane and visceral, a clear window into the time-sensitive stakes of decades of research routinely jeopardized by political headwinds. \u201cIt\u2019s not critical that people understand exactly how stem cells work, or exactly how CAR-T cells work,\u201d said Gantz. Instead, the film highlights how \u201cthis is such an important moment and to follow these patients and the scientists and the doctors\u201d, many of whom have been working on treatments for very specific diseases for decades.\nAs with The Race to Save the World, another Gantz film released this year, which embeds with the personal lives of several climate activists instead of macro-level arguments for change, Ending Disease captures \u201cthe tremendous emotion that these families are dealing with, hoping for a cure for their loved ones\u201d rather than the technical explanations of how, exactly, stem cell therapies function. There are appointments, tentative conversations with doctors about scans, needle injections and families crowded around a hospital bed, a playful fight between Custer and his father over a disappointing college grade, a nurse playing with immuno-compromised Ava in a full bodysuit, Caldwell\u2019s mother recalling his coming out, a conversation between Wiers and her husband, both Catholics, over their initial reluctance and eventual support of therapies involving embryonic stem cells.\nIn between, experts such as Irving Weissman, the director of the Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine at Stanford University, offer some academic context to the individual stories. Weismann, a pioneer of stem cell research for cancer treatments, attests to the heated cultural wars that have stilted scientific progress. The term \u201cstem cell research\u201d will likely conjure, for many, the debates of the early 2000s, when the administration of George W Bush outright banned the use of fetal tissue, such as embryonic stem cells, in scientific research. In 2004, California voters took matters into their own hands and passed state funding for its own stem cell research at the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM).\n\u201cSince that time, we have been able to develop purified blood-forming stem cells to rescue people from high-dose chemotherapy with their own stem cells,\u201d Weissman said. Scientists have, for years, demonstrated that such treatment is possible, but to carry it forward to actual treatments takes years of FDA-approved clinical trials, and additional years of research, that can be jeopardized by political loyalties to anti-abortion groups opposed to the use of fetal tissue, sometimes obtained from abortions and not used in all stem cell therapies, for scientific research.\nIn June 2019, Donald Trump stalled federal funding for research involving fetal tissue with a shock executive order, a move that pleased the anti-abortion groups his administration sought to appease. The order, reportedly on the whims of an obscure but dogged West Wing staffer named Joe Grogan, halted trials of breakthrough treatments for HIV and forced some labs to lay off staff and abandon projects. (It also delayed efforts to investigate possible Covid-19 treatments in March 2020.)\n\u201cIt would be great if we could get rid of that political and religious aspect to looking at science, and let science at least make its case and be adjudicated by the other bodies,\u201d said Weissman, \u201crather than have a ban that precludes any of this scientific and medical development.\u201d The major obstacles to the advancement and, crucially, accessibility of stem-cell treatments remains \u201cshort-term politics, not understanding what pharmaceuticals do and can do and how they must operate\u201d from a profit motive. And, furthermore, the \u201cvalley of death\u201d gap between discovery and actual therapy \u2013 a gap that is \u201cour responsibility to look at, find out what the gap is, and fill the gap so that we can advance medicine for people\u201d, said Weissman.\nFor the patients in Ending Disease, the gap is tangible, a tentative and real lifeline. Not all the trials were a success \u2013 the film is dedicated to Steven Sharpling, who died in 2018 after stem cell injections could not fully eradicate the brain cancer known as anaplastic astrocytoma. But even small wins are consequential for everyday life. Within months, Custer regained the ability to move his arms, and even passed a driving test using a modified car. Wiers\u2019s treatment, which retrained her own white blood cells to recognize and destroy cancer cells, rescued her from essentially a death sentence; she\u2019s now cancer free. Caldwell\u2019s T-cell levels cleared a level high enough to take him off anti-viral HIV medications. Ava George\u2019s stem cell therapy retrained her immune system enough that she can go to school with other kids. These are visions of the future; not so much silver bullets as pathways out of pure incurability \u2013 should we choose to support them.\nEnding Disease is available digitally in the US and UK on 5 November",

        "content": "Women\u2019s rights activists fear for their lives as Afghanistan\u2019s new rulers infiltrate, detain, beat and torture groups of protesters\nA month ago, Reshmin was busy organising protests against Taliban rule in online groups of hundreds of fellow women\u2019s rights activists. Now the 26-year-old economics graduate must operate clandestinely, dressing in disguise and only demonstrating with a select few.\n\u201cIf things continue like this, there will be no future for women in Afghanistan. It\u2019s better if the future never arrives,\u201d says Reshmin, who spoke to the Guardian using only her first name, which means \u201csilk\u201d in Farsi, out of security concerns. \u201cEach time we go out, we say farewell because we might not make it back alive.\u201d\nSince the Taliban\u2019s lightning takeover of the country in August, Reshmin and her younger sister have attended a flurry of protests in Kabul, part of nationwide demonstrations where Afghan women have hoisted signs demanding the right to education and work, and chanted slogans such as \u201cFreedom!\u201d and \u201cEliminating women means eliminating human beings!\u201d\nThey belong to a cohort of Afghan women\u2019s rights defenders who chose not to flee this summer but stayed to tackle the Taliban\u2019s clampdown on their freedoms. Buoyed up by the past 20 years of international support and encouragement, they have staged pockets of protest across Afghanistan, from quiet parks to urban thoroughfares. The Taliban have responded with violence, beating women with electric batons and detaining and torturing the reporters who covered the protests.\n\u201cThe next generation will be brainwashed by the Taliban\u2019s ideology, then it will spread like the Covid-19 virus. The world needs to pay attention for its own sake,\u201d Reshmin says.\nBut international pressure to hold the Taliban accountable over the rights of women and girls is being ignored. A slew of foreign delegations, aid agencies and donors, including from the UK, have consisted of all-male teams and only \u201clegitimises the Taliban\u2019s patriarchal view of the world\u201d, Heather Barr, of Human Rights Watch, warned this week.\nNow, two months into Taliban rule, the activists say they are being hunted down. In recent weeks the Taliban have accelerated their crackdown on women\u2019s groups by infiltrating and intimidating them.\nActivists described how on several occasions members of the Taliban appeared at a private address that was only discussed on closed chat groups on social media. Ahead of a recent protest in Kabul, Taliban police called a group of women on their phones just before they set out to put up posters, Reshmin says.\n\u201cThe only tool they know is to silence people through creating fear,\u201d says Mina, a university professor and activist, who asked that a pseudonym be used for fear of retribution from the Taliban.\nZahra, another organiser in Kabul, describes methods ranging from having women pose as journalists to obtain personal information from protesters to spreading rumours among activists that their number had been shared with members of the Taliban.\n\u201cThe Taliban know if they lash us on the street they\u2019ll look bad and get criticised,\u201d says Zahra, \u201cbut it\u2019s easy to try to dismantle women\u2019s groups online.\u201d\nZahra, who obtained her master\u2019s degree in urban design last year, was supervising the building of a women-only outdoor market when the Taliban swept to power. The European-funded project has been abandoned and she now pours all her energy into activism.\nLast month the Taliban banned all demonstrations that do not have official approval, adding the requirement that slogans at the protests also be approved by the group first.\nMina says this is a tactic designed to expose them. \u201cThey are trying to identify some of the active members of the women\u2019s movement. This is how they force them to submit,\u201d she says.\nReshmin, who was protesting on Kabul\u2019s streets last week, says she will not ask the Taliban for permission because \u201cthat would mean we have accepted their regime\u201d.\nSince the Taliban captured Kabul just over two months ago, there has been a cascade of miserable news for Afghan women and barely a day passes without their rights shrinking further as they are dismissed from jobs in state media, banned from most other work and secondary school, barred from sport and blocked from a now-obsolete system designed to protect women from violence.\n\u201cWe believed that Afghan women would not go back in time. We believed that our war against the Taliban would be won,\u201d says Roya Dadras, spokeswoman of the now-defunct women\u2019s affairs ministry, which the Taliban took over as the headquarters of its draconian morality police. She spoke to the Guardian from Australia, where she sought refuge in early October after spending a month in hiding in Kabul.\nCompounding this is the country\u2019s dire economic situation: the notoriously bitter Afghan winter is approaching, and with the foreign aid that powered the economy still largely suspended, 95% of Afghans are not getting enough to eat, the UN has warned.\nThe number of female activists on the streets is decreasing, and the strain of trying to put on a brave face amid their troubles is taking a toll on their health. Taliban members badly beat Reshmin\u2019s sister at a protest, leaving her right hand unusable for a month, and her skin now suffers from painful flare-ups.\nReshmin\u2019s mother and three sisters started taking antidepressants several weeks ago. Mina\u2019s teenage daughter, whose education stopped with the Taliban\u2019s ban on girls attending secondary school, became so stressed that she started to lose her hair. Mina shared a photo of the back of her daughter\u2019s head where large areas of skin are exposed.\nIn Nangarhar province in the country\u2019s east, where there is less international media attention than the Afghan capital, women\u2019s rights protests have been violently broken up by Taliban members, says Rahmani, an activist and former prosecutor. Several female protesters were also detained and tortured, she adds.\nFearful for her life, Rahmani has moved between relatives\u2019 homes in recent weeks, bringing with her only a few items of clothing each time. \u201cActivists cannot sleep soundly,\u201d she says.\nAfter spending the past month in hiding with her husband and three children, terrified that the Taliban would harm them, Mina and her family are trying to flee to a neighbouring country. She hopes to provide support to those still protesting. \u201cI am trying to help the women and girls who are scared, depressed and anxious. Some are thinking about suicide.\u201d\nZahra Joya contributed to the reporting",

        "content": "The reintroduction of bison to the Carpathians is a boon for nature \u2013 and local communities \u2013 as our writer discovers on a hiking break\n\u201cFrom this pile of logs onwards, we need to be completely silent,\u201d says Georg Messerer, our guide through Romania\u2019s southern Carpathians. His head cocks 45 degrees as a bird starts chirping. \u201cNuthatch,\u201d he whispers, reaching for his binoculars. \u201cAnd two red deer.\u201d Georg directs our gaze to a row of apple trees, where sure enough, two deer are grazing.\nGeorg is an environmental encyclopedia. Give him a fresh footprint or dropping and he can tell you what the animal was and when it was there. Born in Germany, but with extensive guiding experience in Southern Africa, Georg has been guiding here, in the remote hills of Rusca in the \u021aarcu Mountains, near the villages of Armeni\u0219, for more than five years \u2013 ever since the reintroduction of free-roaming bison to the area began.\nThe European bison (longer legged and slightly larger than their American cousins) became extinct in the wild in 1927 due to hunting and habitat loss \u2013 and had been absent in Romania for nearly 200 years. A keystone species, vital for creating a mosaic of habitats by grazing on fast-growing dominant tree species, their movement opens up undergrowth and creates fertile soil \u2013 and they distribute seeds on their fur and in faeces. They are \u201clandscape architects\u201d; nature\u2019s chainsaw \u2013 which is why WWF Romania and Rewilding Europe have been working hard to bring them back. It\u2019s part of on-going efforts to restore nature and wild ecosystems and in doing so help fight the impact of the climate crisis.\nSince the initial release of 17 bison onto Magura Zimbrilor (Bison Hillock) near Armeni\u0219 in 2014, the number has grown to 100 (with newborns and new arrivals from elsewhere) \u2013 providing excellent ecotourism and tracking opportunities. The project is one part of a remarkable conservation success story, supported by the European Union\u2019s LIFE programme. Now there are about 7,000 bison across the continent, up from 2,500 just 10 years ago.\nI\u2019m on a trip to track bison, spending three days hiking through forests and mountains, staying in cabins, renovated farmhouses and safari tents. The focus is on slow, mindful movement rather than clocking up miles \u2013 though we\u2019re on our feet for six hours a day or more.\nThe southern Carpathians are also home to large carnivores like brown bears, wild boar and wolves, as well as chamois, lynx, golden jackals and wildcats. It is a place that still feels wild. As we walk, the smell of mint rises through the warm air, and densely forested mountains layer into the distance. A rare ural owl perches on an ash tree nearby, long-tailed tits flit around and join blackbirds, robins and finches in song, falling silent only when a sparrowhawk \u2013 a killer of small birds \u2013 glides overhead.\nWe stop just before reaching a wetland and Georg turns to us with widened eyes. \u201cBison,\u201d he mouths. Binoculars out, we watch two huge, muscular animals grazing while a third bison goes 12 rounds with a tree (they can weigh up to 1,000kg). They soon realise they\u2019re being watched, and we see a full herd stampede up a steep hill nearby, leaving the ground shaking in the process.\nCamera traps have shown bison co-existing happily enough with wild boar and bears. More surprising to local conservationists were the birds that started using bison fur as insulation for their nests, and how water-filled bison footprints have become highways for small toads.\nWe reach our campsite in time for lunch \u2013 balma\u015f, a traditional meal made with cheese from a nearby farm, melted in a cauldron with oil, water and cornflour \u2013 cooked by Bibi, a local hunter. Matei Miculescu, a WWF bison ranger, joins us. His work has been imperative in helping the project develop within the community. Armeni\u0219 was ideal for bison because of the vast mixture of grasslands and forest, but the bison were accepted because the mayor at the time, Petru Vela, believed they would also bring jobs, he tells us.\n\u201cFrom the beginning we saw the need to work with and invest in locals,\u201d says Miculescu. \u201cWe started from scratch with tourism here. Before the bison, we didn\u2019t have even one accommodation option. We helped one family to renovate a guesthouse. Now in the summer season it\u2019s almost fully booked out. That\u2019s a good income that they didn\u2019t have before.\u201d\nLocals are hired to cook and transport people from villages to camps and airports. You can buy local schnapps, and a souvenir shop is in the works. WWF works closely with hunters, to prevent poaching and show the income wildlife can bring. A local organisation, WeWilder, has also been set up as a social enterprise arm of WWF to work with the community and compensate anyone who loses crops to bison, which may stray into the village looking for food in their first year, while still not fully wild.\n\u201cThey can damage an orchard or eat haystacks,\u201d says Matei. \u201cUnfortunately, the government system which should pay for the damages is not properly in place, so it\u2019s difficult to get the money back.\u201d\nStill, the bison have been overwhelmingly well received. \u201cIt\u2019s important because in the long term, it will be the locals who have to take care of the bison and the habitat,\u201d says Matei. \u201cThe idea isn\u2019t just to focus on the bison, it\u2019s to develop small businesses so that families can benefit.\u201d\nAfter an evening walk and a comfy night in safari tents we move on the next day to Sat B\u0103tr\u00e2n, a village near Armeni\u0219, to meet Oana Mondoc of WeWilder, who has overseen the production of the tourist infrastructure in the area. We visit MuMa, the tiny house built by WeWilder in lockdown, nominated for a EUmise architecture award for helping a \u201clocal community take steps towards sustainable relationships with nature and new pathways to prosper from its wilderness.\u201d The 15 square metre one room-space, on raised wooden legs with huge window overlooking the orchard it\u2019s in, is completely sustainable \u2013 even the oil used to cook our food is recycled into candles.\n\u201cIf you have a blank slate, you have to be really careful with the way you set things up,\u201d Mondoc says. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to set an example in terms of no impact architecture.\u201d\nWhile two of our group will spend the night there, the rest of us stay in a luxurious, stone farmhouse close by, with natural soaps and even plant-based toothpaste provided.\nThat afternoon we all meet up to explore a chamois trail with Petru, a local tracker who has built wildlife hides in the forests. We learn to tell bison tracks from cattle, and go on a night walk beneath star-speckled skies, spotting wildcats and foxes. On our last day we wander again meeting local shepherds whose sheep dogs protect their livestock from wolves, and pick plums as we climb to a wildlife observatory looking out over the Bison Hillock, with 2,192-metre V\u00e2rful \u021aarcu behind us.\nSomewhere in the vast hills below, bison are grazing, and the ecosystem around them thrives.The trip was provided by Much Better Adventures who are partnered with the European Safari Company, the tourism arm of Rewilding Europe.

The Australian pork industry is aiming for carbon neutrality by 2025 while the red meat industry aims to be carbon neutral by 2030.\n\u201cSo we are on that path,\u201d Davis said. \u201cWe fully support at Farmers for Climate Action [the government] signing that pledge and committing to it.\u201d\nSign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter\nBut the National Farmers Federation has backed in the Coalition for not signing the pledge, with president Fiona Simson saying the methane commitment could be a \u201creally blunt instrument\u201d.\nSimson said while she understood the pledge was more about fugitive emissions targeting gas extraction, \u201cwe feel like the bunny in the spotlight right now\u201d.\n\u201cThe high-level pledge just says you are going to cut methane by 2030 so there is \u2026 room for an animal activist [to] come in and create all sorts of strange outcomes targeting agriculture.\u201d\nSimson said that livestock growers had already cut emissions by 57% in the decade between 2005 and 2015 but countries which had supported the pledge \u201cstill have to go home and get it to work\u201d.\nYet she acknowledged Australian farmers were increasingly exposed to an \u201cerratic and wild climate\u201d.\n\u201cMany farmers have come out of what is the worst drought in living memory, we have experienced the worst bushfires, even now in Armidale there has been wild hailstorms and tornadoes, and farmers are looking at how they can best prepare their farms to withstand those sorts of climatic shocks,\u201d Simson said.\n \nEmail:\u00a0sign up for our\u00a0daily morning and afternoon email newsletters\nApp:\u00a0download our free app\u00a0and never miss the biggest stories\nSocial:\u00a0follow us on YouTube,\u00a0TikTok,\u00a0Instagram,\u00a0Facebook\u00a0or\u00a0Twitter\nPodcast:\u00a0listen to our daily episodes on\u00a0Apple Podcasts,\u00a0Spotify\u00a0or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app\nBoth farm leaders gave the Coalition credit for landing the 2050 net zero pledge and creating programs such as the carbon and biodiversity pilot to pay farmers for improving environmental measures on their landscapes.\nFarmer groups are increasingly signing on to commit to more ambitious targets. On Thursday, the NSW Irrigators Council, which only recently signed up to net zero 2050, confirmed it had landed an \u201caspirational\u201d target to be carbon neutral by 2030.\nThe NSWIC CEO, Claire Miller, said the irrigation sector was on the frontline of climate change, both environmentally and economically.\n\u201cThe economy of the very near future will demand and expect nations to demonstrate their commitment to reducing emissions. To remain globally competitive, our leaders must demonstrate Australia is doing our bit.\n\u201cIt\u2019s only a matter of time. We are already seeing the shift, with the EU recently warning Australia may face carbon tariffs if it does not commit to strong 2030 targets.\u201d\nFarmer Andrew Young runs Redgold, a salad growing farm in Mildura, producing 3,000-4,000 tonnes of salad a year for supermarkets and fast food companies. He said the unknowns related to the threat of a warming climate dominated his worries.\n\u201cWe are in the Mallee, we are drying and we are more storm-prone. We are also more internationally focused. I think it is poor of Australia, as wealthy as we are, not to stand up and look after less-privileged neighbours.\u201d\nWhile he is not a livestock producer, he said he would still face costs of transition to a low carbon economy but he was prepared to wear it and fully supported signing on to the global methane pledge.\n\u201cIf it means we have a bit less cattle, well sorry, this problem is bigger than individuals. Let\u2019s not forget what the big goal is. I have lots of freight and lots of plastic, but we need to get on top of climate so if i am a bit of collateral damage, so be it.\u201d\nDavis said farmers wanted to be part of the solution to climate change but they also needed to know the rest of the economy was \u201cmoving alongside them\u201d.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t eat coal. We need to protect Australia\u2019s agricultural industries to make sure we can continue to feed and clothe Australians and ... the world,\u201d Davis said.\nSign up for the Rural Network email newsletter\nJoin the Rural Network group on Facebook to be part of the community",

Still arguably one of the greatest races of all time, Tiznow\u2019s win by a nose over Sakhee in 2001 is not a bad place to start. If that was close then there was literally no separating High Chaparral and Johar in the 2003 Cup Turf, not even a flared nostril. Winners rarely come at much longer odds than Arcangues\u2019 133-1 but Lester Piggott coming out of retirement in 1990 aged 54 to win on Royal Academy in the Mile is arguably the best story in Breeders\u2019 Cup history.\nNot many will fondly remember the now-defunct Marathon but what about some jockey-on-jockey action?\n2) Danny Ings returns to Southampton on Friday with Aston Villa and you would not bet against him finding the net. The Winchester lad is unlikely to celebrate if he scores, but here\u2019s some who were more than happy to stick it to their former clubs.\nCarlos Tevez enjoyed his double when Manchester City hosted United in the January after the Argentinian crossed the divide. Zlatan Ibrahimovic let the Internazionale fans know when he beat J\u00falio C\u00e9sar from the spot against his former club in the first derby since his return to Milan. If a Panenka penalty was not enough salt rubbed into the wound, Sergio Ramos made sure Sevilla fans were clear who their tormentor was in 2017. While these are all strong entries, nothing tops Emmanuel Adebayor running the length of the pitch to knee slide in front of a jilted ex.\n3) The buildup to Canelo \u00c1lvarez and Caleb Plant\u2019s super middleweight title fight has been spicy. The bookies are not giving the American much of a shot against \u00c1lvarez and it is easy to understand why, not only does the Mexican hit hard but he is fabulous in defence. Still, Plant is pretty slippery himself.\n4) Runners \u2013 it\u2019s cross-country season! Here\u2019s an epic finish in a 2016 NCAA women\u2019s race, 16-year-old Holland Reynolds with a gut-wrenching crawl to the line to give her school a state championship title in 2010; a substantial pileup after a tumble near the start line in Alaska, two ways of embracing the mud, trying to retrieve a lost shoe embedded in a mud-bank \u2026 and \u2013 ouch \u2013 victorious Jimmy Gressier fluffing his finish-line knee slide.\n5) AFC Sudbury of the Isthmian League Division One North are the lowest-ranked team in the FA Cup first round proper. The eighth-tier club have come through the preliminary round, the first qualifying round, a second qualifying round replay, the third qualifying round and the fourth qualifying round to earn a tie with their League Two neighbours Colchester.\n6) Putting together the ultras of Besiktas, Fenerbahce and Galatasaray is a recipe for disaster but in 2013 they were united by a common cause. Copa 90\u2019s Istanbul United documentary tells that story wonderfully.\n7) Some more forgotten goals: Trevor Brooking for England v Hungary in 1981; Cyrille Regis for West Brom v Norwich in 1982; Brian McClair for Manchester United v Chelsea in 1987; Roy Wegerle for QPR v Leeds in 1990; Rod Wallace for Leeds v Spurs in 1994; and Niclas Jensen for Manchester City v Leeds in 2003.\n1) The kind of showdown that would sadly never happen these days, but here\u2019s 1979\u2019s World\u2019s Fastest Bowler Competition.\n2) Ten reasons why MotoGP is not for the faint of heart.\n3) DK Metcalf and Marshon Lattimore are not good friends.\n4) Anyone for a counterattack?\nSpotters\u2019 badges: whobroughtoranges, robinbarwick, germit\nDo subscribe, if you fancy.\nLikewise.\nAny suggestions for next week?

        "content": "Pablo Larra\u00edn\u2019s overwrought fantasy, set during a stifling royal Christmas in 1991, offers an arthouse-bizarro version of Diana\u2019s story\nWhat would have been Princess Diana\u2019s 60th birthday came and went this summer, marked by a solemn new statue in the Sunken Garden at Kensington Palace in London, showing her with three generically grateful children; this statue effectively superseded the one of Diana with Dodi Fayed in Harrods department store, which was taken down in 2018. But maybe that new bronze image will itself be superseded by the arthouse-bizarro Diana promoted in Spencer, an entertaining, if overwrought, overpraised and slightly obtuse movie, an ironised fantasy opera without music. It is about Diana having a \u201ccrack-up\u201d over one stifling Windsor Christmas at Sandringham in 1991, with which screenwriter Steven Knight appears to have transcribed a dream he once had after eating his bodyweight in brie. The director is the Chilean film-maker Pablo Larra\u00edn, and it features an intrusive score by Jonny Greenwood, deafeningly cranking up the dysfunction.\nDiana is cleverly impersonated by Kristen Stewart, who is particularly good at shoulder-shrugging convulsions of misery and protest \u2013 although this big-screen awards-season performance is not as good as Emma Corrin\u2019s relaxed and sympathetic portrayal in TV\u2019s The Crown. However, Stewart does get the biggest laugh of the year when Diana irritably dismisses a maid to be alone: \u201cI want to masturbate \u2026\u201d\nAs in Larra\u00edn\u2019s 2016 film, Jackie, about Jackie Kennedy\u2019s trauma after the JFK assassination, this features quite a bit of Diana wandering stricken through corridors, although Jackie had just been showered in her dead husband\u2019s blood. To approximate something like that motivation, this film conspicuously exaggerates Diana\u2019s first-world problems with black-comic stylings, fictional flourishes and some beautiful images. The nightmarish absurdity of what Diana had to endure and her consequent unhappiness create something that looks as if it has been co-directed by former Sun editor Kelvin MacKenzie and Dario Argento. The film maybe concedes a little drama-queen-of-hearts entitlement on Diana\u2019s part, but of course we are supposed to be absolutely on her side, with flinch-making scenes of self-harm and bulimia.\nDiana has showed up to Sandringham alone, casually driving herself in her open-topped sports car, committing an unpardonable error of taste in arriving after the Queen (Stella Gonet). She is already semi-estranged from Charles (Jack Farthing), who snaps meanly at her over one of the interminable meals, and Diana is, moreover, menaced by a fictional glowering flunkey, Major Gregory (Timothy Spall). But there are friendly faces about: her boys William (Jack Nielen) and Harry (Freddie Spry), with whom Stewart has a sweet scene, playing at soldiers on parade. The fictional cook Darren (Sean Harris) is her confidant and mate, and she has her devoted fictional dresser Maggie (Sally Hawkins).\nWhat is most intolerable for Diana is having to wear the clothes picked out for her, and again Knight gives Stewart some great lines. Holding up a gown, she says to her sour-faced maid: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t fit.\u201d \u2013 \u201cHave you tried it on?\u201d \u2013 \u201cWith my mood.\u201d Driven mad by depression and by the Firm\u2019s callous indifference and emotional stagnancy, Diana roams the grounds at night, to the horror of the local police, and tries breaking in to her nearby childhood home.\nBut the film ultimately implies that her problems are down to the ghastly Windsors: away from them, driving around in her car with the boys, listening to Mike and the Mechanics on the tape-deck and having an unpretentious KFC, she could relax and be herself, a Spencer. But you could argue that the Spencers were terribly grand and messed-up as well. Another type of film, without all the Halloween gothic naivety, might have challenged this view; it might have dramatised her relationship with her mother, say, or with the boys\u2019 nanny, \u201cTiggy\u201d Legge-Bourke. This an enjoyably strange spectacle, perhaps best appreciated by taking it less seriously than its creators intended.\n Spencer is in cinemas from 5 November.",
