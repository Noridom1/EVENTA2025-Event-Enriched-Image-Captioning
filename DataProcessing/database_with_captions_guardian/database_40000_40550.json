Victoria Derbyshire is instead attracting millions of viewers while continuing to present the morning rolling news programme on the BBC News channel in her old programme\u2019s timeslot.\nThe U-turn means that many of those who had expected to be unemployed this year have been asked to continue coming into work as the BBC fights to keep its news programmes on air despite an expected wave of staff illness and self-isolation.\nOne BBC journalist whose role is due to be made redundant said the lack of clarity on whether this is a permanent reversal was distressing. They said those who were already preparing for unemployment were being considered \u201ckey workers\u201d and asked to turn up to work at the BBC\u2019s headquarters to keep programmes on air: \u201cSpeaking as someone whose job is at threat, I draw no comfort from being told we are just going to sack you in six months time because we need you right now. Why should I risk my life and health to brave central London?\u201d\nThe BBC has seen its standing in national life elevated in the last fortnight, with enormous numbers tuning in to watch its news broadcasts, along with pledges to provide extra shows to educate and entertain the nation during the lockdown period.\nKeeping on the 450 news staff will add to the financial challenge due to be inherited by Lord Hall\u2019s successor as director general. He has already had to delay the introduction of the licence fee for the over-75s as a result of the pandemic, which will cost the corporation tens of millions in lost revenue. At present there are no plans to delay the appointment of the new director general, with interviews likely to be conducted over video chats.\nTracy Brabin, the shadow culture secretary, said it was time for the government to pause its consultation on decriminalisation of the licence fee, which is due to finish next week: \u201cIt beggars belief that the BBC should have to work with the future of their funding hanging over during this time of national crisis.\u201d\nBBC sources also said BBC Two\u2019s Newsnight is expected to leave its own studio from Monday and move into the News at Ten studio, broadcasting slightly later in a 10.45pm slot as part of efforts to keep the programme on air with reduced levels of technical staff.",

Buy-to-let lenders have not offered any assistance to landlords from our experience. Essential workers are not exempt from such evictions.\u201d\nThe government\u2019s new emergency legislation includes measures to stop eviction for the next three months, and the housing, communities and local government secretary, Robert Jenrick, said last week: \u201cThe government is clear \u2013 no renter who has lost income due to coronavirus will be forced out of their home, nor will any landlord face unmanageable debts.\u201d\nHowever, Labour and other critics pointed out that this only extended the notice required for possession from two months to three. Shelter, the housing charity, has said 20,000 evictions are currently going through the system and some people are likely to be left homeless while ill or trying to isolate because of vulnerabilities.\nHealey said Labour was calling for a guaranteed extra safety net for renters to ensure that no one loses their home as a result of the coronavirus crisis.\nHe said the party\u2019s own analysis showed that 6 million of the country\u2019s 8.5 million renting households have no savings to fall back on and are particularly vulnerable to loss of income during the crisis.\nThe chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has announced that the government will raise housing benefit to cover those in the cheapest 30% of private rented properties, but Labour said this did not go far enough.\nIn addition to calling for a six-month ban on evictions and rent suspensions, Healey called for a doubling in the funding for discretionary housing payments to allow councils to cover rent shortfalls in around 300,000 additional cases, and a relaxation of property size restrictions on housing benefit for private renters.\nHe said the government should also raise benefit rates for private renters to at least cover average rents in each area, and relax the current cap on benefit payments, which hits families facing high housing costs.\n\u201cAfter a decade of cuts, our housing safety net is already letting renters slip through the gaps,\u201d Healey said. \u201cIt is not fit for purpose for the period we now face when family finances will be under extra pressure.\n\u201cThe chancellor\u2019s commitments so far only partly row back on these cuts, and government action falls well short of what renters need. The government must now urgently give renters a guarantee they will not lose their home as a result of coronavirus, by strengthening the safety net for households who have their hours cut or lose their job.\u201d",

The deal worked out between the White House and Congress is worth $2tn (\u00a31.7tn), or about 10% of the annual output of the world\u2019s biggest economy. That is colossal by any standards. By comparison, the fiscal boost provided to mitigate the damage caused by the global financial crisis of 2008 amounted to $800bn.\nThe US budget is going to explode this year. Depending on the length and depth of the recession, it could hit 20% of GDP.\nBut with that sort of fiscal injection, you can afford to spread the money around, which is what the package does. If the advance reports are right, there will be a $1,200 cheque posted to American adults on a middle income or below, with an extra $500 for each child. On top of that, there will be more generous support for those losing their jobs, through the extension of unemployment insurance by 13 weeks and a four-month enhancement of benefits.\nTogether, these mean Americans would get their full salaries for a guaranteed period if forced out of work by Covid-19.\nA quarter of the stimulus is aimed at business. There will be direct financial help for some sectors, such as airlines and airports, but the bulk of the corporate support comes in the form of loans and grants to businesses of all sizes. The US Treasury will put aside a sizeable sum to indemnify the Federal Reserve against losses it might incur from extending credit to struggling companies.\nDonald Trump is desperate to get the stimulus signed into law, which has allowed Democrats in Congress to extract some important concessions. The cash payments go in full to anyone earning less than $75,000 a year, and will then be tapered and not paid at all to anybody paid more than $99,000.\nThe Democrats have also taken steps to avoid company bosses enriching themselves at the expense of the government. There will be a ban on share buybacks \u2013 a traditional form of enrichment for US CEOs \u2013 for the duration of any loan plus one year. Trump himself will not be able to benefit and there will be a new inspector general and oversight board to check that the aid is being properly spent.\nThe size and the comprehensive nature of the package will limit the amount of pain that the US is going to suffer as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic but it is not going to eradicate it entirely.\nWall Street is awaiting the weekly jobs report due out on Thursday with trepidation. Before the crisis broke, about 200,000 Americans a week were filing jobless claims. The lowest estimates for the latest week are 2 million and some are double that. The pain from a likely tripling of unemployment will be colossal.",

Many students are also facing demands from landlords on many UK campuses for ongoing rent on their vacated rooms.\nAn online petition to parliament for reimbursement of this year\u2019s fees, posted this week by a geography undergraduate at the University of Liverpool, had gathered nearly 250,000 signatures by Wednesday evening.\nIn the past two weeks British universities have switched to online or remote learning to counter the spread of Covid-19 and many have also closed their campuses. Some courses were also affected by weeks of staff strike action earlier in the year.\nWhile many students acknowledge their universities\u2019 efforts to continue delivering their education, others are angry they are not getting the university experience they were promised.\nSophie Quinn, 21, who started the petition, has returned from Liverpool to her family home in Maidenhead, Berkshire. \u201cI feel being a final year student it\u2019s affected me the most. Obviously there was lots of industrial action, which disrupted our studies. Now with this coronavirus, I just feel like everyone has been completely disrupted.\n\u201cObviously it\u2019s not any university\u2019s fault, but we\u2019ve missed out on quite a lot of things. We don\u2019t have a graduation date to look forward to any more. A lot of people are demotivated to do the work. The tuition fees pay for libraries and upkeep of buildings. We are not allowed to use any of that. We are not getting what we paid for.\u201d\nJohn Cater, the vice-chancellor of Edge Hill University in Merseyside, acknowledged students\u2019 concerns and called for the government to write off a proportion of this year\u2019s tuition debt.\n\u201cUniversities are working hard to teach, assess and graduate current cohorts of students, and we will all depend on the major tranche of tuition fee income we receive after Easter,\u201d Cater said.\n\u201cBut it is also the case that students\u2019 learning and living experiences have been and will continue to be disrupted by the current pandemic. One strategy the government might wish to consider is to write off a proportion of this year\u2019s tuition fee loan. This would be a considerable act of goodwill but one which would be of little or no cost to the state, neither now nor for many years to come.\u201d\nWriting off tuition debt raises serious issues about similar refunds for international students, on whom UK universities now rely for a substantial proportion of their income. International students are not entitled to student loans, and pay far higher fees than their domestic peers, so any refund would result in universities handing back cash they can ill afford to lose.\nUniversities UK, which represents 136 institutions, urged students who were not satisfied to complain to their university in the first instance.\nMost domestic and international students have returned home where possible, with the Department for Education now advising those still on campus that it was safer to remain rather than risk travelling by public transport.\nBut many students have found their accommodation providers unwilling to end their contracts, forcing them to keep paying rent despite their university telling them to move out.\nPetros Passos, a first year student at Heriot-Watt University and resident of the Dobbie\u2019s Point private halls in Glasgow, says most students have already vacated their rooms. However, Student Roost, which runs the halls, is still expecting students to continue paying rent for several weeks\u2019 longer.\n  Passos has returned to London to support his mother, a key worker, and is struggling with rent payments. He has received emails from Student Roost warning it may send his case to a debt recovery agency, harming his future credit rating.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very stressful,\u201d Passos said. \u201cIt\u2019s very unfair and unethical to do this, they\u2019re not worried about reputational damage because they can open another building and move on.\u201d\nThe National Union of Students has asked the government to protect student tenants by banning evictions, waiving rents for at least three months, and releasing students from rental contracts for next year without incurring penalties.\nA spokesperson for Student Roost said: \u201cAs these are unprecedented circumstances, we have made an exception to our normal cancellation policy to support our residents. We will be cancelling residents\u2019 payments from 1 May if they plan to move out, or have already moved out, of their student accommodation.\u201d",

The 37-year-old died in hospital in Budapest on Tuesday.\nExperts say antibody tests that show whether or not a person has had the virus will first be used to work out how many people contract the virus but remain asymptomatic, before being given to NHS workers. Public Health England has said thousands of 15-minute home tests will eventually be available to people with symptoms.\nThe infection is still spreading in Italy but, for the third consecutive day, its rate has slowed. The World Health Organization says the country could reach its peak number of coronavirus cases on Sunday.\nThe death toll rose by 743 to 6,820 on Tuesday and, on Wednesday, the national federation of doctors said another four Italian doctors had died, bringing the total to 29.\nAccording to local media reports, officials in the country say the latest figures show 86 new cases in 24 hours \u2013 the highest daily figure of the pandemic to date. The health ministry says 387 people have been infected, and two more deaths take the toll to seven people.\nBelgium has recorded a significant rise in the number of people being admitted to hospital, with experts warning the disease has not yet reached its peak. The country\u2019s federal crisis centre says 434 people have been admitted to hospital in 24 hours; an increase of 50% on the previous day.\nBelgium now counts 4,937 people with a coronavirus diagnosis, up 668 in the last 24 hours, while 178 people have died.\nCarmen Calvo tested positive after being treated in hospital on Sunday for a respiratory infection. She is doing well and receiving medical treatment, according to the Spanish government.\nThe UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, launched the plan and called on governments to work together to combat the pandemic.

Islamic State, which has targeted Sikhs in Afghanistan before, said it carried out the attack.\nUp to 200 people were trapped inside the temple when the attack began at about 7am, interrupting worship that had started an hour earlier. The attackers reportedly threw grenades, and after bursting into the complex, started shooting indiscriminately.\n\u201cThe attackers arrived on the stairs and started killing the women. My nephew shouted and said to me \u2018Uncle, please go downstairs\u2019, and when I tried to go downstairs, they shot my nephew in the head,\u201d said Harander Singh, who lost several other relatives including his wife, father and daughter.\n\u201cMy dearest daughter was wounded, and she was repeatedly calling me \u2018Dad\u2019 before she died,\u201d he told Reuters, through tears.\nThe attack was condemned internationally and across much of Afghan society.\n\u201cMy colleague Meharwan Singh lost his uncle and 20 friends, including two children and four women, in this appalling terrorist crime today,\u201d said Nader Nadery, a top civil servant and presidential adviser, on Twitter. \u201cI share his pain and outrage.\u201d\nAfghanistan\u2019s tiny Sikh community is one of few religious minorities in the country, protected by law but frequently targeted by extremists and subject to discrimination.\nThirty years ago it was 500,000 strong, but after decades of conflict and the rise of the Taliban \u2013 who ordered Sikhs to wear yellow armbands \u2013 many have sought asylum in India and the community is thought to have been reduced to about 300 families.\nIn 2018 a convoy of Sikhs and Hindus travelling to meet the president, Ashraf Ghani, was targeted by an Islamic suicide bomber. The massacre on Wednesday was the second Isis attack on a religious minority in March; a gathering of the predominantly Shia Hazara ethnic minority was also attacked earlier this month, with more than 30 people killed.\nAs news of the latest attack broke, a spokesman for the Taliban, which recently signed a withdrawal deal with the US government and is moving towards intra-Afghan talks, was quick to deny any responsibility in the killings.\nAfghan officials and Taliban leaders met for several hours of talks on Wednesday and are expected to start a prisoner release programme next week. The prisoner releases were a precondition for starting intra-Afghan peace talks, which are meant to follow a US withdrawal deal.\nBut they have been delayed because the results of presidential elections last year are still contested, the two main candidates have held parallel inaugurations, and Ghani, the incumbent, said the promise of prisoner releases was made unilaterally by the US negotiators.\nThe US, after failing to broker a compromise between Ghani and Abdullah Abdullah, threatened to cut aid to the government by $1bn if they did not reach agreement.\nAdding to the country\u2019s troubles, there are fears that a coronavirus outbreak could be gathering force, as tens of thousands of Afghans have returned from badly hit Iran this year without any quarantine or testing. There are fears it could overwhelm the country\u2019s health system, and the UN has called for a ceasefire to help prepare for the looming crisis.",

The rate of new infections slowed for a fourth consecutive day, rising by 3,491 compared with 3,612 on Tuesday.\n\u201cThis is an extremely positive factor,\u201d said Ranieri Guerra, from the World Health Organization, of the slowing infection rate. \u201cIn some regions we are close to the falling point of the curve and therefore probably the peak could be reached this week and then fall,\u201d he told Radio Capital. \u201cI believe that this week and the first days of the next will be crucial.\u201d\nIn both Spain and Italy \u2013 as in the UK \u2013 concern has grown about healthcare workers in overcrowded hospitals who have scant supplies of protective gear such as masks and gloves.\nItaly\u2019s national federation of doctors said 29 doctors had now been killed by the virus, including four on Wednesday. More than 5,000 health workers across Italy have tested positive, the Anaao Assomed union told the Ansa news agency.\nIn Spain, healthcare workers account for nearly 14% of the country\u2019s 47,610 cases, officials say. Amid reports of overwhelmed emergency wards, doctors and nurses have complained of a lack of basic protective equipment that has forced them to ration crucial supplies and craft protective shields out of plastic bags.\nTwo unions representing doctors have filed lawsuits aimed at forcing the regional health authority and the Spanish government to deliver scrubs, masks and goggles to hospitals and other health centres. Nato said on Tuesday that Spain had asked it for medical supplies, requesting items including 450,000 respirators, 500,000 testing kits and 1.5m surgical masks.\nGermany and France have faced criticism over export bans on products such as masks and goggles. The EU is expected to sign off on Thursday on a \u201cmore ambitious and wide-ranging crisis management system\u201d that will include a plea for the lifting of such bans.\nAround the world, the number of confirmed coronavirus cases has climbed to more than 423,000. Among the latest to test positive is Prince Charles, who is showing mild symptoms, according to a spokesperson for Clarence House.\nThe true number of global cases is likely to be much higher. Officials in Spanish regions such as Madrid and Catalonia initially dealt with a shortage of testing resources by asking people with mild symptoms to simply self-isolate, while Italy\u2019s top coronavirus response official, Angelo Borrelli, has suggested the real number of infections there is probably 10 times higher than the official count.\nThe accelerating pandemic \u2013 it took 67 days to reach the first 100,000 cases and four days to hit the latest 100,000, according to the WHO \u2013 has led to an estimated 1.7 billion people being ordered to remain at home around the world.\nIn the US, where infections have passed the 55,000 mark and more than 800 people have died, legislators reached a deal on a $2tn (\u00a31.85tn) rescue package on Wednesday, the biggest bailout in US history.\nIn New York \u2013 home to nearly half of the confirmed cases in the US \u2013 the shuttering of bars, restaurants, clubs and gyms may have helped slow the rate of hospitalisation in recent days, the state\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, said on Wednesday.\n\u201cNow that is almost too good to be true ... This is a very good sign and a positive sign, again not 100% sure it holds, or it\u2019s accurate but the arrows are headed in the right direction,\u201d Cuomo told a daily news conference.\nIn China, life began returning to normal on Wednesday as restrictions on movement, construction and transport were lifted after two months of lockdown in Hubei province, where the outbreak began. The lockdown in Hubei\u2019s capital, Wuhan, will be lifted on 8 April.\nThe lockdown measures appear to have successfully curbed the number of infections, according to a report from Imperial College London.\nIn other developments:\nThe first death was reported in the occupied West Bank, of a Palestinian woman in her 60s.\nRussia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, postponed a public vote in April on a constitutional change that would allow him to stay in power beyond 2024.\nClosures aimed at containing the coronavirus pandemic are preventing aid from reaching 300,000 people in conflict zones across the Middle East, the Norwegian Refugee Council said.\nLibya announced its first coronavirus case, as experts warned the conflict between two groups for control of the country could make containing the spread of the virus very challenging.\nSouth Africa\u2019s police minister said two people had been charged with attempted murder for refusing to obey orders to self-isolate.\nReporting team: Hannah Ellis-Petersen in Delhi, David Smith in Washington, Jennifer Rankin in Brussels, Patrick Wintour and Sarah Boseley in London, Rory Carroll in Dublin, Helen Davidson in Sydney, and Kim Willsher in Paris.",

        "content": "Underpaid and overworked, care workers carry the responsibility of protecting the elderly from a disease to which they are uniquely vulnerable. They need more help\nBefore December\u2019s general election, Boris Johnson promised cross-party talks on the crisis in Britain\u2019s social care system within 100 days of a new Conservative government. The self-imposed deadline expired at the weekend. In the context of the biggest public health crisis for 100 years, that\u2019s understandable. But as the coronavirus epidemic tests to destruction the political assumptions and priorities that have shaped our society, alarm bells are once again ringing in the care sector and must not be ignored.\nAs Britain experiences its first week of lockdown, there are reports of some providers finding themselves unable to access adequate food supplies as a result of supermarket restrictions. Care England has expressed concern that social care employees are not being recognised as key workers by some schools, shops and supermarkets, despite clarification by the government of their status.\nHuge risks are being taken by care workers in the absence of adequate protection. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has assured parliament that all care settings should have personal protective equipment by the end of this week. That simply must happen. But it still seems unclear whether social care providers will be guaranteed the hand sanitiser, aprons and gloves they need, as well as masks.\nThese issues are symptomatic of a flawed system that has too often treated the social care sector as a second-class auxiliary health service, to be left to the vagaries of market forces and cash-strapped local authorities. Cross-party talks can wait. But this mindset must change immediately.\nGiven the clear evidence of Covid-19\u2019s lethal impact on the elderly, it is fair to say that, along with hospitals, care homes are the most vulnerable institutions in Britain. There are over 11,000 in Britain. Most are small and run by independent providers. The rest are operated by the big care groups and local authorities. The valiant, poorly paid staff who work in them face a potential perfect storm in the coming weeks.\nAppalling remuneration for a stressful job \u2013 one that requires considerable social and technical skills \u2013 has contributed to a recruitment crisis in the sector. That has now been compounded by staff absences, due to a lack of any Covid-19 testing equipment. As in our hospitals, this has led to nurses and other workers self-isolating when that might not have been necessary.\nPublic Health England on Wednesday suggested that mass testing for key workers could soon be possible. That, clearly, would be a gamechanger. It is imperative that care homes are provided with priority access as staff attempt to control perilous closed environments. The evidence is already in from countries such as Spain that transmission in residential homes can be swift and deadly.\nCarers are currently working in the dark as to which care home residents or clients may have contracted coronavirus. The CEO of one charity, which runs 200 care homes, said this week that there have been deaths where the disease was suspected, but that there was no way of confirming the outbreak.\nAs a staffing crisis looms and more carers fall ill, a drive similar to the \u201cNHS needs you\u201d campaign, launched by the government last week, may soon be needed to persuade former carers to return to work. To make this a success , the challenges and requirements of the sector need a higher political profile, more public awareness and greater backing.\nInadequately funded, undervalued and still not properly integrated into Britain\u2019s health services, social care has endured a Cinderella status for too long. That scandal cannot be allowed to lead to tragedy during this national crisis. Whether working in care homes or visiting vulnerable people and helping them maintain their independence, social care workers are truly unsung heroes. In an epidemic which seeks out and targets the elderly, they are on the frontline of resistance. There must be a focus on their needs that is commensurate with the responsibilities they carry.",

The club declined to comment but it is understood the affected supporters are those who opt to pay in advance for season tickets as part of nine- or 10-year fixed-price deals which represent considerable savings on other packages. It is also understood Newcastle wrote to fans on these deals this month offering those who buy their tickets with a one-off, up-front, annual payment the option of switching to interest-free monthly direct debits.\nIt is believed the club, mindful of supporter reaction, could now prove sympathetic towards fans who request a payment holiday.\nNUST said: \u201cLast week NUST contacted Newcastle United to express significant concerns regarding season-ticket payments. We did not receive a response. There is no prospect of professional football recommencing any time soon given the global health crisis, let alone the prospect of understanding the implications on timing on fixtures for next season.\n\u201cWe find it incredibly disturbing that the club continues to take payments from supporters during these extremely difficult times.

        "content": "In 18 days a few hundred cases escalated to more fatalities than China\nOn Saturday 7 March, 24 hours before hundreds of thousands of people rallied across Spain to mark International Women\u2019s Day, and 9,000 faithful Vox supporters arrived in Madrid for a far-right jamboree, authorities in the northern region of La Rioja were taking some difficult decisions.\nThat weekend, not quite three weeks ago, Spain had confirmed just 430 coronavirus cases. After 60 of those were traced to a funeral in the neighbouring Basque country, La Rioja\u2019s regional government ordered the quarantining of entire blocks of a neighbourhood in the small town of Haro.\nEighteen days later, Spain has confirmed 47,610 cases, and, with a death toll of 3,434, has logged more fatalities than China.\nHealth workers, who account for about 14% of the country\u2019s coronavirus victims, are complaining about a lack of basic protective equipment; a Madrid ice rink has been converted into a makeshift morgue; and the capital\u2019s flagship conference centre has gone from hosting the Cop25 climate conference to sheltering the sick as it is repurposed into an enormous field hospital.\nFor some of those 18 days, life continued as normal - tables and chairs began to recolonise pavements outside bars and cafes, and parks began to fill with picnickers as winter faded away.\nEven as parts of Haro were being quarantined that Saturday afternoon, Fernando Sim\u00f3n, the head of Spain\u2019s centre for health emergencies, said people had to make up their own minds about the risk from coronavirus if they joined the International Women\u2019s day parades. \u201cIf my son asks me whether he can go, I\u2019d tell him to do what he wants,\u201d he told a press conference.\nAnd so the marches went ahead, as did Vox\u2019s huge meeting in Madrid and countless sporting fixtures. Three Spanish cabinet ministers \u2013 all of whom marched that Sunday \u2013 have contracted the virus, as has Bego\u00f1a G\u00f3mez, wife of the Spanish prime minister. Vox\u2019s leader and its secretary general also tested positive.\nWorry hit Madrid on 11 March when, with 1,646 cases confirmed, regional government ordered all nurseries, schools and universities to close, as well as galleries, including the world-famous Prado.\nSimilar measures soon followed elsewhere and, on the evening of 12 March, the Catalan government ordered about 70,000 people in four municipalities in the Barcelona region to remain in their homes for two weeks after a steep increase in cases in the area.\nAs pressure on the government of the prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, mounted, toilet paper was frantically stockpiled, larders and freezers were filled, and the streets of central Madrid emptied. Then, a week after the Haro lockdown, the inevitable finally happened: S\u00e1nchez ordered an initial two-week lockdown.\nFor many in Spain, both living and dead, the national lockdown came too late. This week, which is becoming grimmer by the day, began with the defence minister revealing that soldiers drafted in to help tackle the outbreak by disinfecting residential homes had found a number of elderly people abandoned and dead in their beds.\nIn a country that takes justified pride in its family bonds, its conviviality and its national health service, these are bleak and sobering days.\nBut if, between the long hours of home-schooling, the phoning of friends, the bingeing on box sets and the fixating on recipes, people are wondering what exactly has happened and why, Spain\u2019s doctors are not among them.\nThe pandemic did not drop out of a clear blue sky, they say \u2013 look at China, at South Korea and, far closer to home, at Italy. Then look back at Spain and remember that it is a country still suffering the effects of the 2008 economic crash and its attendant cuts.\nEach night at 8pm, people gather on their patios and balconies to acknowledge the efforts of the country\u2019s health workers. For a couple of minutes, while the applause bounces around each barrio, the fear is forgotten, elbowed out by gratitude and solidarity.\nBut when the ritual thanks are no longer needed, the clamour for answers will be just as loud and insistent.",

        "content": "When the UK gets through this crisis, it will be the people who should take the credit\nWe were still a long way short of John Bercow\u2019s last prime minister\u2019s questions hurrah. That clocked in at a mind-numbing 70 minutes. But with parliament due to go into early recess that evening and with no guarantee of a date for its return, Speaker Lindsay Hoyle chose to effectively run two separate half-hour PMQs consecutively.\nIn theory it was a good idea, as MPs are going to have almost no opportunities to hold Boris Johnson and the government to account during a national emergency. In practice, it rather fell flat.\nThe only questions on anyone\u2019s mind right now are on the coronavirus, but Boris has precious little by way of any answers. Just the usual evasions followed by his new slogan. \u2018\u2018Stay at home. Protect the NHS. Help save lives.\u2019\u2019\nThat\u2019s the closest the government has to a policy right now. PMQs could have gone on for another couple of hours and no one would have been any the wiser.\nThis was Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s last PMQs and it initially felt as if he was determined to fade himself out with a faint whimper. His voice was croaky \u2013 he didn\u2019t sound well \u2013 and though his questions were all perfectly reasonable, he was struggling to inject them with any passion or feeling. And not even his special advisers got to see him shine. They were all thrown out of the press gallery for taking photos on their phones. Perhaps they thought they had seen it all before anyway.\nBut as he got into his second set of six questions, some of the intensity returned. He made a point of praising not just the frontline NHS staff who were struggling to fight the pandemic with limited resources, but also the cleaners who made so many hospitals and workplaces safe.\nHe also raised key issues about help for the self-employed, the level of testing, construction sites forcing workers to come in and a universal credit system that wasn\u2019t fit for purpose even when it didn\u2019t have an extra 500,000 people trying to log in over the past 10 days.\nBoris did his best to sound statesmanlike and gracious \u2013 even he can see this isn\u2019t a time for petty point-scoring \u2013 but he never sounded wholly convincing. This isn\u2019t what he signed up for when he became prime minister, and faking it to make it is a lot harder than it sounds. Telling the country it will need to make sacrifices is not that convincing when the only sacrifices Boris has ever made have been of other people on the altar of his own career.\nWhat answers Boris did give were worse than useless. He couldn\u2019t explain why testing levels were still way down on what he had promised the week before: all he could offer was the promise of millions of tests soon. When exactly, he didn\u2019t know.\nHe pifflepafflewifflewaffled about the self-employed. Some were very rich, so it would be wrong to help the starving before the system had been properly finessed. It was all very difficult, he said, but an announcement would be coming soon. He was also keen that only those who had to go to work should go to work, though obviously it was up to bosses to decide who needed to go to work. Can\u2019t afford to alienate any possible donors to the Tory party, after all.\nPeak nonsense was reached with several Conservative MPs congratulating Boris for the clarity of his messaging. Just about the only clarity the government has has shown so far has been in its obvious willingness to delay. We live in ma\u00f1ana times.\nThe government had two months to learn from the spread of the coronavirus in China, but chose to celebrate Brexit day, fail to deal with the floods and take 10 days off over half-term instead. Any of the decisions it now says it is working night and day on could have been taken weeks ago. Boris\u2019s offer to wrap an arm of comfort around every worker sounded increasingly hollow.\nNor was there much comfort to be had from the daily Downing Street press conference later in the day. Both chief medical officer Chris Whitty and chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance poured cold water on the promise Boris had made at PMQs that millions of antibody tests could be available as early as next week. Whitty even said it was going to be a close run thing whether the NHS would be able to cope.\nBoris just looked done in. Like a children\u2019s entertainer who had long since used up every failsafe gag and trick, long since lost his audience. His eyes are now barely detectable red dwarf pinpricks, hidden by bags collapsing in on themselves as his face melts into the despair of premature old age. All the questions focused on matters of trust. On tests, prioritising the economy before lives and acting soon enough.\nAny country wants to believe in its leader, but it\u2019s clear that now many people have lost faith in Boris\u2019s judgment calls. Even Whitty and Vallance appeared to have their doubts about him, qualifying their support to the limits of their brief and staying well clear of the politics.\nAt critical times, Boris has been found wanting. The wrong person for such a critical time. The only moment of inspiration was the news that 405,000 people had registered as NHS volunteers in the past 24 hours. The UK will get through this, but when it does, it will have been the people, not the government, who should take the credit. The lions leading the donkeys.",

In an interview with CNBC that day he said that US companies should halt share buybacks to preserve cash because \u201chell is coming\u201d \u2013 although he also said that he was buying some stocks.\n\u201cThe hotel industry and the restaurant industry will go bankrupt first, Boeing is on the brink, Boeing will not survive without a government bailout,\u201d Ackman said.\nHowever, Ackman\u2019s opinions appeared to change rapidly, after the US government started to move towards its $2tn stimulus deal. Pershing Square started to unwind its bets on the market falling on 23 March, only five days after he gave his warnings.\nThe fund used the money earned to buy shares in companies such as the Hilton hotel chain and coffee chain Starbucks, as well as in Warren Buffett\u2019s investment vehicle Berkshire Hathaway.\nIn Wednesday\u2019s web post Ackman said: \u201cWe became increasingly positive on equity and credit markets last week, and began the process of unwinding our hedges and redeploying our capital in companies we love at bargain prices that are built to withstand this crisis, and which we believe will flourish long term.\u201d\nThe profit, if confirmed, would rank as one of the most profitable trades ever disclosed by a hedge fund. During the global financial crisis a decade ago, funds run by John Paulson made a reported $15bn betting against the US housing market, gaining him fees of $3bn.\nIt also represents a turnaround for Pershing, which had lost money in the first two months of the year, according to its monthly reports. At the end of February the firm reported assets under management of $6.6bn.\nAckman made his name as an activist investor, buying stakes in companies and pushing for management to make changes that could profit the firm. He co-founded Gotham Partners in the early 1990s, before starting Pershing in 2004.",

He added: \u201cThe single most important consideration is one of public health, and we are determined to act responsibly through the decisions we make.\u201d\nWimbledon, which sits perilously close to the prime minister\u2019s best-case forecast for a flattening out of coronavirus within 12 weeks, have abandoned plans to leave the decision until late April.\n\u201cWith such uncertainty about, changing big, long-term contracts and setting mutually acceptable new dates is difficult and complicated, as can be seen from what has been happening with the Olympics,\u201d said an insider with long experience of negotiating international TV sporting deals on Wednesday. \u201cFor that reason, I\u2019d say the chances of Wimbledon going ahead in June are slim to zero. You go with it now or you call it off.\u201d\nHe said the same strategic thinking underpinned the decision this week by the Japanese government and the IOC to postpone the Tokyo Olympics. They originally announced they would decide within four weeks; ultimately, the call was forced on them within 24 hours. The new date for the Games, the source said, would be determined by an international sporting calendar that is set in stone \u2013 except, of course, when disrupted by something as unexpected and life-threatening as a global health crisis.\n\u201cIt is a matter of finding a window,\u201d he said, \u201cand there aren\u2019t many of those for big sporting events. American TV, to a large extent, determines when a lot of these events can take place. It is not just about the tennis schedule. There is NFL, college sport, baseball, golf and, to a much lesser extent there, [ice] hockey, soccer and tennis.\u201d\nAgainst this background, and the quickening spread of Covid-19 \u2013 in reaction to which Roger Federer has donated one million Swiss francs to vulnerable families in Switzerland \u2013 there would seem to be dwindling belief within the All England Club that Wimbledon will escape postponement or even cancellation, as has been the case with practically every other sport.\nSources say it is highly unlikely Wimbledon would seek to fill the gap created by the postponement of the Olympic Games. The thinking is that it is safer \u2013 and more convenient \u2013 to stick with the existing arrangements, however perilous in terms of planning, than disturb a system that has been in place for years.\nTime is not on their side given the scale of the operation. It takes up to two months to get the site ready for the championships so, realistically, a decision needs to be made by the end of April or the start of May at the latest. The chances of a return to normality in that timeframe do not look promising. It may be tempting for the AELTC to switch its efforts to its expansion across the road from the main grounds on the newly acquired Wimbledon Park Golf Club.\nEarly visitors to Wimbledon will know how close to their deadline contractors have to go in setting up everything from corporate marquees to the many shops dotted around the grounds, as well as parking provisions and security. Wimbledon is, in effect, a small town that comes to life for a fortnight once a year.\nSo, while officially the AELTC is still monitoring the situation, there is acknowledgment the sporting landscape remains too volatile \u2013 in the UK and globally \u2013 for an event as big as Wimbledon to commit to definitely going ahead.\nThe difficulties in moving Wimbledon deeper into the tennis schedule became obvious nearly two weeks ago when the French Tennis Federation (FFT) decided unilaterally to reposition its championships away from the crisis high-point of the spreading virus in May to the supposedly safer waters of September. The FFT would seem to have been vindicated in judging it had no chance of Roland Garros opening its doors to the public on 24 May.\nThe French move created outrage among the game\u2019s stakeholders, especially the United States Tennis Association, whose championships finish a week before the proposed new dates of the French Open, and the Laver Cup, whose tournament in Boston clashes directly with the changed schedule at Roland Garros.\nIt then became obvious a week ago \u2013 when the ATP and the WTA, who run the rest of the men\u2019s and women\u2019s game, extended suspension of all tournaments from late April to 7 June \u2013 that time was running out for the second and third grand slams of the season.\nWhile some inside the AELTC see the sense in making a call in regards to Wimbledon as early as possible, others are minded to follow the government\u2019s lead. Among other considerations, this seeks to protect its insurance claims given it can argue the decision has been taken out of its hands.\nNonetheless, if, as Boris Johnson says, it will take at least three months for coronavirus to noticeably start fading, the odds on Wimbledon going ahead in June are surely indeed \u201cslim to zero\u201d.",

The government later took a more cautious line, saying that the tests would not be available so quickly.\nThe UK government has bought 3.5m tests \u2013 which reveal whether someone has had the virus and is therefore thought to have some immunity \u2013 and is ordering millions more, it has said.\nAt the prime minister\u2019s daily press conference on Wednesday, the government\u2019s medical and scientific advisers said they needed to be certain the tests worked before they could be made available.\n\u201cThe key thing for us to do is evaluate \u2013 are these tests accurate enough to be used by the general public?\u201d said Chris Whitty, chief medical officer. \u201cIf they are incredibly accurate, we will work out the quickest way to release them. If they are not accurate, we will not release any of them.\u201d\nThe tests would, he said, \u201ccompletely transform what we can do\u201d \u2013 but were not as important as the antigen tests which are used to diagnose Covid-19 in sick hospital patients.\nBoris Johnson said they would make the antibody tests available when they could. \u201cWe will do it as soon as possible,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are massively ramping up our testing programme.\u201d\nThe home test, which looks like a pregnancy test, involves pricking a finger to produce a drop of blood, which is then analysed by the device.\n\u201cSeveral million tests have been purchased for use. These are brand new products. We have to be clear they work as they are claimed to do,\u201d Peacock said. \u201cOnce they have been tested this week and the bulk of tests arrive, they will be distributed into the community.\u201d\nAmazon has agreed to carry out distribution and the tests are also set to go on sale in chemist shops.\nSymptoms are defined by the NHS as either:\nNHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should\u00a0stay at home for at least 7 days.\nIf you live with other people,\u00a0they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.\nAfter 14 days, anyone you live with who does not have symptoms can return to their normal routine. But, if anyone in your home gets symptoms, they should stay at home for 7 days from the day their symptoms start.\u00a0Even if it means they're at home for longer than 14 days.\nIf you live with someone who is 70 or over, has a long-term condition, is pregnant or has a weakened immune system, try to find somewhere else for them to stay for 14 days.\nIf you have to stay at home together, try to keep away from each other as much as possible.\nAfter 7 days, if you no longer have a high temperature you can return to your normal routine.\nIf you still have a high temperature, stay at home until your temperature returns to normal.\nIf you still have a cough after 7 days, but your temperature is normal, you do not need to continue staying at home. A cough can last for several weeks after the infection has gone.\nStaying at home means you should:\nYou can use your garden, if you have one. You can also leave the house to exercise \u2013 but stay at least 2 metres away from other people.\nIf you have symptoms of coronavirus, use the\u00a0NHS 111 coronavirus service\u00a0to find out what to do.\nSource:\u00a0NHS England\u00a0on 23 March 2020\nAsked if they would be available in days rather than weeks or months, Peacock said: \u201cYes, absolutely.\u201d If there was a charge for them, she thought it would be minimal, she added.\nWidespread availability of a fingerprick test that produces results in 10 to 15 minutes would be a game-changer. NHS doctors and nurses with symptoms would know immediately whether they have had Covid-19, enabling them to get back to work sooner.\nNHS workers or anyone else would be able to know if they have had the virus and are therefore immune, which means they could resume their normal lives, no longer having to work from home or keep their distance from other people. It is widely thought that having had Covid-19 makes people immune to the disease. There have been cases of apparent reinfection, though they are rare.\nThe test detects the presence of IgM, an antibody that arises very early on in the infection, and IgG, which is increased in the body\u2019s response to the virus. The results of some of the tests on order can be read by anyone, but others would need to be interpreted by healthcare professionals.\nThe UK is not the only country ordering the antibody tests. \u201cTests are being ordered across Europe and elsewhere and purchased in south-east Asia. This is widespread practice. We are not alone in doing this,\u201d said Peacock.\nAmazon had agreed to deliver the home tests, Peacock told the committee. There was no suggestion from her that the Royal Mail might be given the contract.\nThe antibody home tests are part of a programme of increased testing, she said. The number of nasal swab tests, which are currently being used in hospitals to find out whether very sick patients have Covid-19, will be increased within the next couple of days.\nThe government has promised that these tests, for current viral infection, will reach 25,000. Last week, the numbers tested topped 8,000 but since then have fallen to a low of 5,522, recovering yesterday to 6,491.\nPeacock reiterated that they would get to 25,000 a day. It is understood that a deal has been struck with the pharmaceutical giant Roche to increase the numbers to that level.\nPeacock said there were also plans to be able to test up to 100,000 key workers a day. \u201cThere is urgent work going on,\u201d she said. A test processing centre that has just been opened in Milton Keynes would allow a much bigger laboratory of these standard PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests.\nThe home-based test kits would be the third plank of the testing programme. The fourth was seroprevalence testing \u2013 blood tests to establish how widespread the virus was in the country.\nA Boots spokesperson said: \u201cWe are keen to work with the government to explore opportunities to support Covid-19 testing and to support the NHS in any way we can. However we do not have any type of Covid-19 tests in our stores. Customers should not make a trip to a Boots store or pharmacy for this purpose.\u201d\n This article and its headline were amended several hours after publication after the government\u2019s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, contradicted earlier evidence to a select committee from Prof Sharon Peacock, the director of the national infection service at Public Health England, about when the tests would be introduced.",

        "content": "Rishi Sunak pressured into measures amid fears coronavirus will trigger unemployment crisis\nThe chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is expected to announce that the taxpayer will pay self-employed workers up to 80% of their recent earnings to help contain the economic impact of coronavirus, as 470,000 extra benefits claims sparked warnings of an \u201cunemployment crisis\u201d.\nSunak has been under growing pressure to do more for the UK\u2019s 5 million self-employed after announcing an unprecedented job retention scheme for employees last Friday, that will see thousands paid to stay at home.\nIt comes as Covid-19 claimed the life of a 21-year-old woman from Buckinghamshire, according to her family, and Britain\u2019s deputy ambassador to Hungary, who was 37. It was announced on Wednesday night that the number of confirmed UK cases stood at 9,529 people and the death toll had risen by 41 to 463.\nThe prime minister promised on Wednesday that the government was preparing to \u201cput its arms around every worker.\u201d He said the self-employed would be offered \u201cparity\u201d with employees \u2013 though Whitehall sources cautioned that did not mean the two schemes would be identical.\nDetails of the support package were still being finalised last night, but sources with knowledge of the plan suggested it would echo the promise of covering 80% of recent earnings that Sunak made to employees last week.\nIt could be subject to a lower cap than the \u00a32,500 in monthly pre-tax income available in that scheme, however \u2013 because the self-employed tend to pay less tax. Some groups, including those already claiming universal credit, could be excluded.\nSpeaking at the daily Downing Street press conference, the prime minister said: \u201cI genuinely don\u2019t think there\u2019s been a time in our history in the last century, certainly, when the government of this country has put its arms around so many people to get us through a very tough time. We will get through it, and we will get through it together.\u201d\nSunak significantly increased the generosity of universal credit as part of last week\u2019s package, and made it available to more self-employed workers.\nA sharp surge in claims for universal credit has underlined the severe economic toll the coronavirus is already taking on Britain\u2019s workforce.\nThe work and pensions secretary, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, revealed on Wednesday that 477,000 people had applied for the benefit in the past nine days. That is more than during any entire month of the 2008-09 financial crisis.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know if they\u2019re self-employed or at different stages, and I want to assure people that help, even if it\u2019s not currently the level of help they would like, is there to help them through the safety net of the welfare state,\u201d she said.\nKarl Handscomb, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: \u201cThe unprecedented surge in new universal credit claims shows that the UK is already in the midst of an unemployment crisis. The increase in claims is putting huge pressure on our social security system, and is driven by a huge hit to family incomes.\n\u201cThe government was right to increase the generosity of the benefits system last week. It now needs to ensure the resources are there so that claims are processed quickly, and people receive support as soon as possible.\u201d\nThe Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) is redeploying 10,000 staff to help process the extraordinary upsurge in new applications, making it the department\u2019s main focus in the weeks ahead.\nIts permanent secretary, Peter Schofield, said: \u201cWe made a decision that managing claims and making payments is a number one priority for DWP. Operationally we can deprioritise other things.\u201d\nThe department has so far redeployed 1,500 members of staff to help with the sharp rise in universal credit claims, and is to increase this to 3,900 by the end of the week.\nThe shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, who will return to the backbenches in ten days\u2019 time when a new Labour leader takes over, used what is likely to be one of his final speeches from the frontbench to call for the government to announce details of its scheme for supporting self-employed workers urgently.\n\u201cIf people claim fraudulently while still working, they will rightly be prosecuted. But right now millions of cabbies, childminders, plumbers, electricians, painters and decorators and actors have all lost work or closed down their businesses. As have builders, designated as the self-employed under the construction industry scheme and they have no income. They need a solution, now,\u201d he said.\nMeanwhile businesses continued to demand clarity about who can keep travelling to work, as firms called for workers to come in despite Monday\u2019s plea by the prime minister for the nation to \u201cstay at home\u201d.\nCarolyn Fairbairn, director general of the CBI, tweeted: \u201cIt\u2019s clear that many firms do not know whether to stay open or to close.\u201d She said she would meet the business secretary and request better guidance.\nThe warnings come amid widespread confusion among businesses about how to respond to the lockdown. Halfords, the car parts, bike and servicing group, is reopening some of its stores this week after being designated an essential service. It had closed its shops on Monday night as Johnson addressed the nation.\nMike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct retail chain had intended to remain open but was forced to backtrack after a public outcry.\nFrances O\u2019Grady, the director general of the TUC, said the government needed to crack down on non-essential companies making staff attend work, telling ministers they needed to directly intervene if employers flouted the rules.\n\u201cCompanies like Sports Direct shouldn\u2019t be putting their profits before people\u2019s lives. No one in non-essential services should be forced to go to work. And no one should be sacked for following official instructions and staying home,\u201d she said.\nOff-licences and other shops licensed to sell alcohol are now allowed to stay open, after an 11th-hour change, while several companies are lobbying ministers to be allowed special treatment.\nThe mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, called for tough enforcement action against companies forcing their staff to travel to work in non-essential jobs during the lockdown.\n\u201cThis is wrong. It\u2019s risking the health of workers, their families and wider society. In the absence of a clear government instruction to end non-essential work I am taking legal advice about whether Greater Manchester police or other agencies can take enforcement action against companies which are exposing their employees in this way.\u201d",

        "content": "New York\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, has said officials are seeing very early signs that physical distancing may be starting to slow the spread of coronavirus in his state, but cautioned that the number of cases is still rising significantly and hospitals would soon be overwhelmed.\nThe New York City metro area accounts for 60% of new Covid-19 cases in the US. Despite that, Cuomo said it was encouraging that hospitalizations were projected to double every 4.7 days on Tuesday, compared with Monday, when the number was doubling every 3.4 days, and Sunday, when the figure was every two days.\n\u201cThe arrows are headed in the right direction, and that is always better than the arrows headed in the wrong direction,\u201d Cuomo said at a press conference Wednesday.\nBut the virus still continues to spread quickly, and Cuomo said the \u201csingle greatest challenge\u201d New York faces right now is a severe lack of ventilators, essential equipment for patients with potentially fatal Covid-19 infections. He said New York needs 30,000 ventilators but only has 4,000 in the current system.\nCuomo said the state has purchased 7,000, and the federal government has now provided 4,000 as high-tier officials start to recognize New York\u2019s crisis. Cuomo has said doctors would start trialling the use of one ventilator for two patients.\nNew York City on Wednesday took further steps to decrease the density of people, announcing that some roads would be shut to cars to allow pedestrians to use them, and encouraging social and physical distancing to be observed in playgrounds. Sports that involve \u201cclose contact\u201d such as basketball should also be avoided.\nCuomo warned that if these measures to reduce the density did not work on a voluntary basis, then the city would make the guidelines mandatory.\nThe moves came after Dr Deborah Birx, part of the White House coronavirus taskforce, said on Tuesday that about 56% of all the cases in the US, and 60% of new cases, are in the New York metro area. Mike Pence called on people who have recently left New York for other parts of the country to self-quarantine for 14 days.\nThe vice-president said: \u201cWe have to deal with the New York City metropolitan area as a high-risk area.\u201d\nDonald Trump tweeted on Wednesday that he had a good conversation with Cuomo, who later thanked Trump and his team for their cooperation. The tone was a considerable change from Tuesday, when Cuomo had fiercely criticized the federal government\u2019s response to the pandemic and balked at Trump\u2019s suggestion that restarting the economy superseded public health concerns.\nWhile Trump has said he would like to see parts of the US economy reopening for business by April, and see churches packed by Easter Sunday, on 12 April, New York officials have implemented extreme social distancing measures, having non-essential employees work from home, shuttering schools and only allowing restaurants to provide takeout and delivery.\nStill, more than one in every thousand New York residents has tested positive for the virus. The state confirmed 30,811 cases and 285 deaths as of Wednesday morning; 12% of cases have required hospitalization.\nNew York\u2019s mayor, Bill de Blasio, said: \u201cThe world we knew is gone. And it\u2019s not coming back, not for the next few months. That\u2019s the blunt truth. We\u2019re gonna lose some people.\u201d\nNew York state accounts for roughly 7% of all confirmed coronavirus cases worldwide, and De Blasio said it was likely more than half of all New Yorkers will get Covid-19. New York City alone tallied 17,856 cases and 199 deaths. The large number of cases could be attributed to New York\u2019s large testing numbers \u2013 it is testing more people per capita than South Korea.\nNew York officials are scrambling to equip hospitals with basic necessities to combat the virus. The hospital system has been given a mandate to increase capacity by at least 50%, but even if all hospitals doubled their capacity, the state would still be 34,000 beds short to accommodate projected numbers once the outbreak reaches its peak in the coming weeks.\nThere is also a severe shortage of space in intensive care units, where the most critical patients access ventilators. Right now, New York can support 3,000 ICU beds, but Cuomo said the hospitals will need 40,000 ICU beds \u2013 a more than 1,200% increase.\nThe Jacob Javits Center \u2013 a landmark convention center in midtown Manhattan \u2013 is being repurposed as a temporary hospital for Covid-19, along with four other sites selected by the army corps of engineers. But those new facilities will only inject a few thousand hospital beds into the wider network.\n\u201cThe inescapable conclusion is that the rate of infection is going up,\u201d Cuomo said at a press conference a day earlier, on Tuesday. \u201cIt is spiking. The apex is higher than we thought, and the apex is sooner than we thought. That is a bad combination of facts.\u201d\nScott Weisenberg, an infectious diseases expert at NYU Langone, said hospitals are trying to create additional capacity with more beds and increased staffing. But he cautioned that a return to normalcy in a few weeks\u2019 time would be completely inappropriate, at least in New York.\n\u201cI would just say I would be very cautious about trying to reopen society too soon,\u201d he said. \u201cOr you\u2019ll end up paying for it with a lot more cases and more deaths that could have been prevented.\u201d",

One described it as the \u201cheight of hypocrisy\u201d.\nAs US coronavirus cases and deaths continued to soar, the president said on Tuesday he wanted to reopen \u201clarge sections of the country\u201d by Easter Sunday \u2013 12 April \u2013 when there would be \u201cpacked churches all over our country\u201d.\nHis comments came despite warnings from White House taskforce members Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx, the latter saying she was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about New York and its surrounding area.\nOn Wednesday the number of confirmed US cases rose to 54,453 and 737 deaths, according to figures from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\u201cIt is the height of hypocrisy for Trump to suggest that Easter is a time to defy public health recommendations and \u2018reopen\u2019 America,\u201d said pastor and activist the Rev William J Barber II.\n\u201cJesus challenged oppression and cared for the poor, while Trump ignored the pandemic of poverty and tragically dismissed intelligence about the coronavirus. We need a resurrection of Jesus\u2019s concern for the most vulnerable, not a capitulation to corporate greed that could cost millions of lives.\u201d\nThe Rev Al Sharpton said that if Trump was going to use biblical language, the president \u201cneeds to know the whole Easter story\u201d.\n\u201cYou cannot get to Easter Sunday without first going through the crucifixion on Friday. A crucifixion precedes the resurrection, Mr President, and we have not even got up Calvary\u2019s mountain yet to the crucifixion, we just have the cross on our back,\u201d he told MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe.\nSharpton said New York \u2013 currently on lockdown with more than 30,000 cases across the state \u2013 would undergo a \u201creal crucifixion\u201d at the height of the pandemic, which will then go around the US \u201cbefore we can get to resurrection Sunday\u201d.\nHe added: \u201cA premature resurrection will lead to a disaster and we need to understand that, deal with it head on.\u201d\nThe Rev Laura Everett, a pastor and executive director of Massachusetts Council of Churches, told of her anger with Trump.\n\u201cStill fuming about Trump co-opting Easter for capitalism,\u201d she tweeted.\n\u201cAre his Christian followers going to follow him down this path? Do you not remember how Lent begins, when the devil takes Jesus to the heights of the city and shows him all the glittery things \u2018if you but worship me?\u2019\u201d\nChristianity Today published a critical editorial following Trump\u2019s comments in which it warned that even with good hygiene and physical distancing, congregating during a pandemic \u201cmars our witness\u201d.\nIt said: \u201cRather than looking courageous and faithful, we come off looking callous and even foolish, not unlike the snake handlers who insisted on playing with poison as a proof of true faith.\u201d\nIn the Catholic church, the Archdiocese of Los Angeles tweeted on Tuesday night, after the president\u2019s announcement, that all its churches would remain closed until \u201cat least\u201d 19 April \u2013 a week after Trump\u2019s suggested deadline.\nIn newly updated guidelines, it encouraged priests to continue celebrating mass without a congregation and live-streaming instead.\nThe Archdiocese of New York, which includes St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral in Manhattan, said it would celebrate Holy Week and Easter Sunday via live stream or broadcast.\nBishop Michael Curry, who gave the sermon at the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, has recommended the suspension of in-person public services in the Episcopal church \u2013 including during Holy Week \u2013 and encouraged people to worship online.\nThe president\u2019s Easter deadline goes against the predictions of experts and political figures like New York\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, who has said the battle against the virus will take several months.\n\u201cI hope we can do this by Easter,\u201d Trump told Tuesday\u2019s White House briefing. \u201cI think that would be a great thing for our country.\u201d\nAsked if that was realistic, he said: \u201cWe\u2019re going to look at it. We\u2019ll only do it if it\u2019s good and maybe we do sections of the country, we do large sections of the country.\u201d\nHe said he chose Easter because \u201cI just thought it was a beautiful time, a beautiful timeline, it\u2019s a great day\u201d.\nHe told Fox News: \u201cYou\u2019ll have packed churches all over our country. I think it\u2019ll be a beautiful time.\u201d",

        "content": "Governor cites jump in claims since 13 March, marking an unprecedented surge\nMore than a million Californians have filed for unemployment this month due to the coronavirus crisis, the state\u2019s governor announced.\n\u201cWe just passed the 1 million mark for the number of claims since March 13,\u201d the Gavin Newsom said at a press conference on Wednesday about the unemployment claims.\nThe jump in new unemployment claims is unprecedented. On a typical day, the California department of unemployment sees 2,000 new claims. Last week, on Wednesday, 80,000 new claims were filed in a single day.\nUnemployment departments, which are run by each state, are being overwhelmed with a surge in new claims since the nation\u2019s businesses began closing their doors, sending home or laying off legions of workers across industries.\nAt a Tuesday press conference, Newsom urged patience as unemployed workers filed claims. California\u2019s unemployment department says people can typically receive unemployment benefits \u2013 a portion of typical income \u2013 within a couple of weeks.\nBut information about why someone left work, and whether it was due to the coronavirus, must be verified with employers and doctors. With businesses shut, and doctors overwhelmed, that process could be delayed significantly.\nA $2tn US stimulus package headed toward the finish line could provide additional assistance, adding $600 a week to benefits across the board. And it would cover workers considered independent contract workers, like ride-share drivers, who aren\u2019t covered by traditional unemployment.\nNewsom last week announced an order that asks California residents to stay home unless absolutely necessary, amid growing rates of corona infections. The order says broadly that people should remain at home unless it is absolutely necessary to venture out for supplies or food.\nEssential businesses, including grocery stores and big-box stores like Target, have been allowed to operate, while all businesses considered non-essential were required to close. The rules have been confusing for workers in some industries; while construction workers are allowed to carry on with residential projects, those working on commercial projects are off the clock.\nLast week, Newsom signed an executive order that asked cities and counties to enact eviction bans to keep people from getting displaced. But with the order set to expire in April, housing advocates have been left to wonder how rent will be paid after that. Newsom said he and a team were reviewing the legality of potential solutions.\nNewsom said on Tuesday he had spoken with CEOs from 200 financial institutions who committed to a 90-day waiver on mortgages and foreclosures. The governor said Bank of America was the only large financial institution that didn\u2019t agree to a 90-day waiver. A spokesman said Bank of America will instead offer relief on a case-by-case basis until the crisis is over and has also agreed to pause foreclosures, evictions and repossessions.\nThere have been nearly 3,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus in California, and more than 60 people have died. The governor also said an investigation was under way to determine the cause of death of a young person in Los Angeles, who is believed to be the first minor killed by the coronavirus. Newsom urged caution about hastening to make assumptions about the case.\nThe death \u201cunderscores the enormity of the challenge in front of us and how it can impact anybody\u201d, Newsom said. Half of all positive cases in California fell in the 18-to-49 age range, Newsom said in a news conference on Tuesday evening. \u201cYoung people can and will be impacted by this virus.\u201d\nOn Wednesday, Newsom added that 37 confirmed coronavirus cases were in children under the age of 18.\nWith an eye to New York, the nation\u2019s new coronavirus center and home to about 60% of the US cases, California leaders are scrambling to prepare for a sudden surge on hospitals that could overwhelm healthcare workers and available bed space.\nThe state needed 50,000 hospital beds to prepare for a coming demand, Newsom said on Tuesday, a projection he has adjusted upwards over the past week. Two additional hospitals, eight field hospitals and a navy hospital ship to be docked in Los Angeles will add to the state\u2019s options.\nNewsom said the state had tested 66,800 people, a huge jump from previous days. The governor attributed the huge jump to tests conducted by private labs including Quest Diagnostics whose tests had not previously been reflected in the total. Kaiser Permanente alone is now performing 12,000 tests a day, but there are still delays in getting the results back.\nNewsom implored state residents to keep a safe distance from those who do not live in the same house and to adhere, completely, to the stay-at-home orders to prevent further spread of the virus.\n\u201cHalfway is no way,\u201d said Newsom.",

        "content": "Labour MP Chris Bryant accuses lenders of charging excessive interest rates\nBritish companies, including major banks, have been warned against profiteering from the coronavirus crisis and told to pass on the benefits of historic stimulus measures to their customers.\nThe Labour MP Chris Bryant has accused UK banks of taking advantage of the surge in demand for emergency loans, despite interest rate cuts and major government-backed borrowing schemes for struggling businesses.\n\u201cThe base rate at the Bank of England is now 0.1% but \u2026 banks like Barclays are charging anything between 7% and 12%,\u201d he said.\nBryant said lenders should be offering loans with interest rates closer to 1% to 4%, depending on risk, and urged banks to take into account how many of their new loans would end up being government-backed if borrowers failed to pay.\n\u201cThey\u2019re taking minimal risks and charging exorbitant rates. It looks like profiteering to me,\u201d Bryant said.\nLast week, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, announced state-backed loans of at least \u00a3330bn for UK companies including through an extended coronavirus business interruption loan scheme that offers interest-free loans of up to \u00a35m for 12 months.\nIn a joint letter (pdf), Sunak, the Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, and the interim head of the Financial Conduct Authority, Christopher Woolard, told UK banking chiefs to take \u201call action necessary\u201d to make sure those measures were benefiting households and businesses as planned.\n\u201cThe priority for all of us \u2013 banks, building societies, government and the financial authorities \u2013 should now be to take all action necessary to ensure that the benefits of the measures \u2026 are passed through to businesses and consumers,\u201d the letter said.\n\u201cThis will require a willingness to maintain and extend lending despite the uncertain economic conditions. We must ensure that firms whose business models were viable before this crisis remain viable once it is over.\u201d\nBut Stephen Jones, the head of the banking lobby group UK Finance, said that businesses that did not qualify for the government scheme would be offered loans at normal rates.\nHe said that run-of-the-mill business loans were not tied to the Bank\u2019s base rate and instead \u201cdepend on a number of factors including the lender\u2019s funding costs, credit risk charges dependent on loss probability plus operating costs incurred by lenders through the life of the loan\u201d.\nBarclays said: \u201cOur interest rates are in line with industry standards.\u201d\nMeanwhile, the Competition and Markets Authority confirmed on Wednesday that it was extending measures that temporarily loosened competition rules for food retailers to all UK companies.\nIt means the competition watchdog will not crack down on rival companies that try to cooperate in the public interest, including to avoid product shortages during the Covid-19 outbreak.\nHowever, the CMA warned it would crack down on any business that tried to take advantage of consumers during the outbreak. \u201cThe CMA will not tolerate conduct which opportunistically seeks to exploit the crisis,\u201d it said.",

        "content": "Judges say Home Office has addressed dangers in immigration detention centres\nThe high court has rejected calls to free hundreds of immigration detainees who, lawyers and human rights activists say, are at risk from Covid-19 while behind bars.\nThe ruling, following a hearing over Skype on Wednesday, was handed down in response to an urgent legal challenge from Detention Action.\nThe legal action asked for the release of hundreds of detainees who are particularly vulnerable to serious illness or death if they contract the virus because of particular health conditions, and also for the release of those from about 50 countries to which the Home Office is currently unable to remove people because of the pandemic.\nThe two judges \u2013 Dame Victoria Sharp, president of the Queen\u2019s Bench division, and Mr Justice Swift \u2013 came down strongly on the side of the Home Office and highlighted the range of measures already being implemented by the home secretary, Priti Patel.\nThese included the release of more than 300 detainees last week, ongoing assessments of the vulnerability of individual detainees to the virusand a range of \u201csensible\u201d and \u201cpractical\u201d steps the Home Office is taking to make detention centres safer, such as single occupancy rooms and the provision of face masks for detainees who wish to wear them.\n\u201cIt seems likely that the arrangements already in place by the secretary of state will be sufficient to address the risks arising in the majority of cases,\u201d the judges said, adding that \u201cthe present circumstances are exceptional\u201d.\nThe court hearing on Wednesday heard that 736 people are still being detained in the UK, while 350 have been released in recent days. It was also confirmed that detainees in three detention centres have displayed symptoms of Covid-19.\nThe Home Office previously confirmed to the Guardian one case of Covid-19 on Sunday at Yarl\u2019s Wood immigration removal centre in Bedfordshire, which mainly houses women.\nThe court heard that in a second centre - Brook House, near Gatwick airport - one detainee who had displayed symptoms was reportedly serving food to other detainees just before he fell ill.\nChris Buttler, representing Detention Action and also representing a detainee who lawyers say is at greater risk from Covid-19 because he suffers from high blood pressure, told the court that expert evidence suggests the virus \u201cwill run rampant\u201d through detention facilities.\nHe argued that the home secretary was acting unlawfully and falsely imprisoning many detainees because removals are no longer possible to 49 countries and it is difficult to remove people to many others.\nHe said that the Home Office was a \u201cglaring exception\u201d to the government\u2019s moves to suppress Covid-19 and that leaving people in detention would further burden the already overstretched NHS when they get sick.\n\u201cThe home secretary is arguably falsely imprisoning some clients who there is no realistic risk of removing,\u201d Buttler told the court.\nLisa Giovannetti QC, representing the Home Office, told the court: \u201cGovernment accepts all reasonable steps should be taken to shield people in high-risk categories and we have been proceeding on that basis. I can\u2019t claim the system is perfect but it\u2019s a reasonable one.\u201d\nShe said reviews to identify the most vulnerable detainees were under way and this process is due to be completed imminently, adding that numbers in immigration detention have fallen substantially from 1,200 in January to 736 now.\nAs part of Detention Action\u2019s case, the public health expert Prof Richard Coker, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, provided an expert report warning that prisons and detention centres provide ideal incubation conditions for the rapid spread of the coronavirus, and that about 60% of those in detention could be rapidly infected if the virus gets into these locked facilities.\nToufique Hossain of Duncan Lewis Solicitors, who brought the case, said: \u201cThis litigation has brought about the release of hundreds of detainees, preventing many from suffering serious harm.\n\u201cHundreds more remain in detention in terrible conditions. Though we are disappointed with the ruling today, this action has clearly focused the minds at the Home Office on vulnerable individuals they usually wilfully neglect.\u201d\nBella Sankey, Director of Detention Action, said: \u201cWhile the high court declined to grant our interim relief tonight, our litigation has already forced major and rapid concessions from the government: 350 people released from detention in the past week; an undertaking to proactively review the detention of all those held under immigration powers according to updated guidance and with a view to further significant releases; and a very strong presumption against any new detentions for people facing removal to around 50 countries.\n\u201cThe government has also been forced to issue new guidance on hygiene standards in detention and to accept that detention poses high risks to those with Covid-19-relevant underlying health conditions.\n\u201cWe will monitor the implementation of all these guarantees and continue to hold the government to account.\u201d\nA Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cWe welcome the court\u2019s decision. Immigration Enforcement is responding to the unique circumstances of the coronavirus outbreak and following the latest guidance from Public Health England. The safety of detainees and staff is of vital importance.\n\u201cDecisions to detain are made on a case-by-case basis and kept under constant review, but our priority is to maintain the lawful detention of the most high-harm individuals, including foreign national offenders.\u2019\u2019",

        "content": "The WA premier is determined to avoid any coronavirus spread as the Vasco da Gama arrives in Fremantle\nHundreds of people will be quarantined on Rottnest Island in Western Australia when a cruise ship carrying 1,500 people arrives in Fremantle on Friday.\nBut the details of their quarantine \u2013 including how those people will be fed, where they will be housed and what will happen to the island\u2019s permanent residents \u2013 are yet to be finalised.\nThe Western Australian premier, Mark McGowan, said on Wednesday that he would be \u201cexercising the Rottnest option\u201d for Australian citizens and residents aboard the Vasco da Gama, which was due to arrive in Fremantle on Friday.\nIt follows the disastrous management in New South Wales of the Ruby Princess cruise ship, from which at least 133 people have tested positive for Covid-19 and one person has died since it docked and allowed 2,700 passengers to disembark in Sydney on 19 March.\n\u201cWe have seen what has happened in Sydney Harbour,\u201d McGowan told reporters in Perth on Wednesday. \u201cIt was a complete and utter disaster. I will not allow that to happen in WA. There are no circumstances where we will allow passengers or crew to wander the streets in our state.\u201d\nThe only exception, he said, would be a life-threatening emergency.\nThe Vasco da Gama was meant to terminate its cruise in Fremantle and its 950 passengers previously had permission to disembark.\nInitially, McGowan said the 800 Australians onboard the ship would be quarantined on Rottnest Island for 14 days. On Thursday, he said that they will be asked to remain on the ship with the 150 foreign nationals and 550 crew members until direct flights home can be organised.\nMcGowan said this decision was taken to maintain capacity on Rottnest Island, which has fewer than 300 accomodation units.\nNon-Australians on board \u2013 about 150 passengers and 550 crew members \u2013 will also be made to remain on the ship until they can be flown home. About 109 passengers are from New Zealand and 33 from the United Kingdom. McGowan said a plan was being \u201cworked up with the New Zealand government to get those passengers back home as safely as possible\u201d.\nNo passengers have tested positive for Covid-19 and there are no reports of illness on board.\nThe ship\u2019s operator, Cruise and Maritime Voyages Australia, said it was disappointed it was not told that its docking permission had been rescinded before McGowan announced it to the media.\nThe company\u2019s managing director, Dean Brazier, told the ABC the ship had been at sea for 13 days straight and it was disappointing passengers would be asked to quarantine for a further 14 days.\nWestern Australia has taken a hard line against cruise ships. On Tuesday police and border force agencies monitored another cruise ship, the Magnifica, as it refuelled in Fremantle to ensure no one disembarked. That ship is currently anchored off the WA coast, attempting to find a port.\nAnother cruise ship, the Artana, was due to refuel in Fremantle on Tuesday night. One person, who has since left the ship, tested positive to Covid-19 and 25 other people have reported respiratory symptoms.\nThe Artana, with 1,300 people on board, has also been asked to remain at anchor off the coast, McGowan said. Health officials from WA boarded the ship on Wednesday night to assess 25 unwell passengers, seven of which later tested positive to Covid-19. Two more tested negative, but McGowan said they remained unwell and there were concerns they may later test positive.\nThere are no Australians aboard the Artana. Most of it\u2019s 800 guests are German.\nThe WA government announced on Sunday that it would use Rottnest Island, which has a brutal history as a colonial prison for Aboriginal people, for quarantine purposes.\nThe announcement saw the number of permanent residents on the island drop from between 150 to 200 on Sunday, to 75 on Wednesday.\nAll visitors to the island were told to leave this week, and McGowan said the government had \u201cmade arrangements for accommodation, catering and security\u201d of people under quarantine.\nAccording to the Rottnest Island Authority there are 292 rental accommodation units on the island, as well as some dormitory rooms. The island is also usually home to about 100 permanent human residents and 10,000 quokkas.\n\u201cWe are exercising the Rottnest option now for two reasons,\u201d McGowan said. \u201cOne, to protect the safety of the Australian passengers; and two, to protect the West Australian community from any possible infection transmission from this cruise ship.\u201d\nMcGowan said the Vasco da Gama would be required to sit offshore at anchor until transport for passengers could be arranged.",

        "content": "Country of five million has 283 cases of coronavirus but Jacinda Ardern warns that may grow to thousands during month-long restrictions\nThe sound of day one of New Zealand\u2019s nationwide lockdown was birdcall. Wood pigeons, tui and saddleback woke to quiet cities and towns, where their songs became the soundtrack to the shutdown.\nMany Kiwis rose late on Thursday, having no work or school to attend, and nothing to do beyond the prime minister\u2019s instructions to \u201csave lives by staying home\u201d.\nIn Auckland, usually clogged highways were miraculously empty, and the police commissioner Mike Bush said besides a few stragglers needing \u201ceducation\u201d on the rules, Kiwis had been compliant with the new measures, which prohibit anyone from leaving their homes except for essential supplies or a brief respite of exercise, taken locally.\nBillboards on state highways flashed out public health warnings, Kiwi-style: \u201cBe kind, stay calm\u201d.\nIn Wellington, parliament had been abandoned, and the last glimpse of prime minister Jacinda Ardern before lockdown was through an impromptu Facebook live video, recorded from her couch in a tracksuit after putting toddler Neve to bed.\nDown south, hundreds waited in Picton to board the inter-islander ferry, which had 2,500 passengers to move before all domestic travel is stopped on Friday. For many, it is a race against the clock \u2013 if they don\u2019t make it home they\u2019ll be stuck for a month or even more.\nOn the west coast of the South Island, locals are used to isolation, and looking after each other is second nature in a region that is the least populated in the country, and prone to getting cut off due to floods or landslips.\nLewis Holland, owner of the Ngakawau Store in Hector, a village of just a few dozen people at the top of the South Island, said his tiny grocery was more of a community service than a traditional shop, and has been classified an essential service by the government, allowing it to stay open.\n\u201cSome of the elderly people will call us and we\u2019ll make up their order. And when they come around we can just put it in their back seat and you know, sort out the payment later,\u201d Holland told the local paper.\nIn Dunedin, on the south-east coast of the South Island, many took to the town\u2019s parks as the crisp Autumn day rose. One woman started a lonesome round of golf on the empty rugby fields of Unity Park, while an old man sat alone on a park bench, staring at the harbour, and waving to strangers in the distance.\nAs lockdown settled in, the number of cases rose, with director-general of health, Dr Ashley Bloomfield, saying more sick people were to be expected for at least the next ten days. After that, authorities would be able to assess if lockdown measures were working. By then, if Kiwis followed the rules, cases should begin to decline.\nThere are now 283 confirmed and probable cases of the virus, Bloomfield said, and seven people in hospital, though none in intensive care. Despite few flights still operating, hundreds of people continue to arrive into Auckland\u2019s international airport, and anyone without convincing self-isolation plans is being escorted by police to nearby hotels and motels for enforced quarantine. Around half of the new arrivals had not made adequate plans, police commissioner Mike Bush said.\nIn Christchurch, a hub for tourist arrivals, vast parks full of campervans have been set up for tourists to self-isolate if they have made no other arrangements. Campervans are still permitted, but anyone travelling in one must drive it directly to one location, and lockdown there for the coming month \u2013 an unwelcome prospect as the temperature plummets, and the days grow shorter. Kiwis have taken many travellers in, after appeals for help and accomodation on social media.\nIn the hours before the lockdown took effect, a number of couples rushed to the altar, unwilling to brave this strange and unprecedented period as merely betrothed.\nIn Manawat\u016b a couple who were supposed to be married before 120 people on Saturday instead tied the knot with six witnesses on Wednesday night.\n\u201cFor us, we\u2019re Christians, it\u2019s not about the glamour of the day, it\u2019s about the commitment,\u201d groom Scott Nicholls told the Manuwat\u016b Standard.\n\u201cWe\u2019re committed to this for the rest of our lives.\u201d\nPanic-buying continues at pharmacies and supermarkets, with the director-general of health ordering prescription limits after medicines were stockpiled.

        "content": "As the fifth anniversary of the Saudi and Emirati coalition intervention dawns, the prospect of peace is further away than ever\nAisha al-Temmimi, 21, has never adjusted to the dust and heat of the Yemeni desert city of Marib. Her family are from the lush green highlands of Hajjah in the country\u2019s north, but were forced to leave after fighting between the Iran-backed Houthis and government forces reached their village two years ago.\nMarib, already rich in oil and gas reserves, has become something of a boom town since Yemen\u2019s war broke out, a place where those displaced by violence elsewhere in the country have found relative safety. Even Marib\u2019s stability, however, has proven fragile after fierce new battles to the north and west of the city.\n\u201cWe thought we\u2019d be safer here,\u201d al-Temmimi said. \u201cSometimes they fight just for the sake of fighting.\u201d\nAt the beginning of this year, the UN\u2019s special envoy to Yemen, Martin Griffiths, praised the country\u2019s warring parties for largely sticking to a 2018 de-escalation agreement: hopes were high that months of relative quiet could lead to more substantive talks. Just two months later, as the fifth anniversary of the Saudi and Emirati coalition intervention in the war dawns, the prospect of peace is further away than ever.\nYemen\u2019s civil war escalated on 26 March 2015 after the president, Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi, fled to neighbouring Saudi Arabia and a coalition of 20 Arab nations intervened to try to drive the Iran-backed Houthis out of the capital, Sana\u2019a.\nSince then the conflict has morphed into the worst humanitarian crisis in the world, killing an estimated 100,000 people and leaving 80% of the population \u2013 about 24 million people \u2013 dependent on aid to survive.\nBoth sides have been accused of indiscriminate attacks on civilian targets, but according to the Yemen Data Project, at least 30% of more than 20,000 coalition bombing raids are estimated to have hit civilian infrastructure.\nThe coalition, which is supported by the UK, US and other western nations, has also imposed a blockade of Houthi territory that has pushed around half of the total civilian population to the brink of starvation and led to outbreaks of cholera and diphtheria. Yemen is now facing a potentially devastating new crisis in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic.\nThe latest round of violence erupted after Hadi\u2019s forces tried to advance along the highway from Marib to the rebel-held capital, Sana\u2019a, but the attempt backfired spectacularly after the Houthis responded with counterattacks on several fronts, advancing to seize al-Hazm, the capital of al-Jawf province, earlier this month.\nHeavy fighting in al-Jawf, which is north of Marib, has sent at least 1,750 families fleeing, overwhelming local aid agencies already working in displacement camps on the outskirts of Marib city, where around 70,000 people are now in need of daily help.\nA total of 35 civilians, including 19 children, were killed by coalition airstrikes on al-Jawf in a single day in February. In one of the single bloodiest attacks of the war to date, 116 soldiers loyal to exiled President Hadi died in a missile attack on a mosque at a Marib military camp that was blamed on the Houthis.\nThose fighting and suffering in the latest violence are Yemeni, and new alliances currently being formed between local tribes and the Houthis are shifting the balance of power on the ground even more strongly in the rebels\u2019 favour. Yet the derailment of the three-year-old ceasefire in the area and the resulting new setbacks to the peace process appear to reflect the ever-diverging interests of the Saudi and Emirati elements of the coalition.\nAfter the fall of al-Hazm to the Houthis, Mohammed Jumeh, Yemen\u2019s permanent representative to Unesco, tweeted that the loss was the result of a \u201cbetrayal\u201d that \u201creflected the interests and side-battles of political and military leaders from outside the country\u201d.\nThe United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia are already in competition for the upper hand in Yemen\u2019s south, where the UAE supports a separatist movement which says it wants renewed independence for South Yemen.\nThe Saudis, struggling with their limited military capabilities and the financial strain of the conflict, have engaged with the Houthis in backchannel talks facilitated by Oman over the last few months, an apparent recognition of the fact that after five years of war, the rebels are not going anywhere.\nInstead, it is believed the Emiratis, who back Yemen\u2019s new chief of staff, Lt Gen Sagheer bin Aziz, pushed for the offensive, in part to curb the ambitions of Saudi-backed clients such as the Islah party, the Muslim Brotherhood-linked bloc of the Yemeni government, which is strong in Marib.\n\u201cIt is no secret at this point that in Yemen Saudi Arabia only cares about securing its borders and distancing Ansar Allah [the Houthis] from Iran,\u201d said Abdulghani al-Iryani, an analyst at the Sana\u2019a Center thinktank.\n\u201cWhat gets underestimated is how high the level of antagonism is between Riyadh and Abu Dhabi, particularly when it comes to support for Islah. The personal rapport between [Saudi crown prince] Mohammed bin Salman and [ruler of Abu Dhabi] Mohammed bin Zayed is what keeps the relationship together. If it were left to institutional channels the coalition would collapse.\u201d\nWith university classes cancelled thanks to the looming threat of coronavirus, al-Temmimi says she has had plenty of time to think about the recent clashes and what they mean for Yemen\u2019s future.\n\u201cIf the Houthis and the Saudis are talking, you would think we could get back to peace talks,\u201d she said. \u201cInstead, we get more fighting. The rest of the world argues about the war and what ordinary Yemenis want doesn\u2019t seem to matter any more.\u201d",

Seven health workers are among those who have died.\nWhile confirmed case have risen to almost 900, researchers have estimated that there could be tens of thousands of hidden infections across the country, and there is growing concern that medical facilities will be unable to cope in the event of a major outbreak.\nOver the past week, two major hospitals have appealed for supplies, while some healthworkers threatened to go on strike after they were forced to wear raincoats for protection. As of Monday, as many as 42 medical staff were infected with coronavirus in Jakarta.\n\u201cI just pray and have faith so that I can stop worrying, even though sometimes that feeling (of worry) appears again,\u201d Agnes Tri Harjaningrum, a paediatrician who works in state and private hospitals in the capital, told the Guardian. She fears the country could face a crisis similar to that experienced in Italy.\nDonations of protective equipment and testing kits arrived from China on Monday morning, but by Tuesday night shortages remained in some of Jakarta\u2019s hospital wards. Equipment is being prioritised for doctors who are directly handling patients, she said.\nIndonesia, the world\u2019s fourth most populous country, was slow to carry out tests, having reportedly performed only a few hundred earlier this month. While cases were detected throughout February in most countries across south-east Asia, it was not until 2 March that the country of 264 million people confirmed its first infections. A study by Harvard University, which analysed air traffic from Wuhan, the Chinese city where the outbreak began, had raised questions over the country\u2019s previous lack of cases. The health minister responded at the time by describing the analysis as \u201cinsulting\u201d and stating the country was on high alert.\nThe president has since acknowleged the need for mass testing, which is being ramped up in priority areas. So far 2,863 have been tested.\nOn Monday, it was estimated by academics at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine that as few as 2% of Indonesia\u2019s coronavirus infections have been reported. That could mean there are more than 34,000 cases. This is higher than the roughly 27,000 recorded in Iran \u2013 though the researchers also estimate that Iran may be identifying as little as 7.2% of its patients.\nThe researchers emphasise that these are rough estimates based on preliminary analysis and it is not yet peer reviewed.\nThere are some limitiations to the estimates. How a country\u2019s demographics might affect the death toll from Covid-19, for example, has not yet been factored into the study. \u201cSeverity [of covid] is highly correlated with age, which means we need to account for it for it to be more accurate,\u201d said Dr Timothy Russell, the lead author. With a median age of 28, Indonesia\u2019s population is younger than many other affected countries.\nAccording to official figures, the capital Jakarta, home to 9.6 million people, is among the worst hit, with hundreds of cases, while dozens of infections have also appeared in Banten and West Java.\nCases appear to be scattering. In West Papua, the easternmost province of Indonesia, three cases have been confirmed while 35 people have been put under surveillance because they have symptoms including pneumonia and have had contact with a confirmed patient.\nAccess to quality health care is limited in the province, especially in highland areas, and health workers are currently assessing patients online because of equipment shortages.\nAnalysis by Reuters suggests that the country\u2019s health system is significantly less well resourced than that of Italy or South Korea, which have both faced major outbreaks.\nIndonesia has 321,544 hospital beds, according to health ministry data, which is equal to about 12 beds per 10,000 people. South Korea has 115 per 10,000 people, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).\nIn 2017, the WHO found Indonesia had four doctors per 10,000 people. Italy had 10 times more, on a per capita basis. South Korea has six times more doctors.\nIndonesia is converting the athlete\u2019s village built for the 2018 Asian Games into an emergency hospital, which it is hoped will be able to treat 24,000 patients.\nModelling by the Eijkman-Oxford Clinical Research Unit (EOCRU), reported by the Jakarta Post, has suggested that, without tough steps to contain the virus, there could be up to 71,000 infections by the end of April.\nJakarta\u2019s governor has declared a state of emergency, and told businesses and religious groups to take measures to stop the spread of the virus. All tourism and entertainment venues have been closed, and public transport limited.\nBut while various lockdowns have been imposed in Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand, Indonesian president Joko Widodo has rejected calls for such measures. He has instead urged the public to stay at home and promised rapid testing. This is now being rolled out in three provinces, while 100,000 protective gears are also being distributed.\nZubairi Djoerban, head of the Indonesian Doctors Association coronavirus task force told the Guardian earlier this week that supplies will be distributed soon. \u201cPrivate sector will help, businessmen will help.\n\u201cBut in the field, please ... the management must [match the] pandemic, meaning that it must be quickly-quickly-quickly-quickly.\u201d",

We must keep stores for the Covid storm that is coming.\u201d\nMoy said there had been a level of \u201cpush and pull\u201d at the global level over supplies of crucial medical equipment, with reports of ships being diverted and price gouging. \u201cWe have to do whatever we can to secure supplies.\u201d\nThe level of supplies varies substantially between each state, with South Australia said to have greater stockpiles than other states.\nMoy also warned it was important to avoid substandard or counterfeit protective equipment circulating in Australia. He said he had heard that some shipments had been held back by customs officials for this reason.",

The man disembarked in Crete.\nThe Italian-flagged Costa Victoria, at sea for a fortnight, docked in Civitavecchia, a port town on the Tyrrhenian Sea 60 kilometres north-west of Rome on Wednesday (Italian time).\nAustralians Brenda and Dave Rondo say while the ship has docked, they have still not been allowed off.\n\u201cWe have to stay in the cabin, they knock on the door and leave food and they step back. The staff has gone from lovely to now, if you ask nicely for milk for your coffee in the morning, they yell at you and say \u2018no!\u2019\n\u201cWe have heard different things, but not from the Captain, that we may go to Rottnest Island in Western Australia for quarantine, but ... the last we heard we will have to stay in Rome in a motel for two weeks.\u201d\nCosta Victoria passengers may be mandated to follow a similar isolation course to passengers from the Costa Luminosa which docked in Savona in northern Italy earlier this week. The ship also had confirmed Covid-19 cases on board.\nPassengers from neighbouring European countries were allowed to travel home to isolate, but Australians, South Africans and others from more distant nations were forced to remain in Italy to isolate for a fortnight.\nConfirmed cases of Covid-19 were left on the ship in Savona, while other passengers were put on buses and driven to Rome, more than 560km away.\nHowever, some passengers say the hotel rooms, which they will be unable to leave for two weeks, are worse than the ship.\n\u201cIt\u2019s smaller than our cabins, no hanging space and barely room to walk around,\u201d said Ivan Maronian.\nOthers have complained of no pillows, taps not working and only tiny meals being provided. Many have been unable to wash any clothes since the ship entered lockdown weeks ago.\nEven worse is the fear of what might happen if they get sick.\n\u201cIt\u2019s completely terrifying because if he got coronavirus on there I\u2019m really not sure what kind of medical care he would be getting, given the situation,\u201d said Laura Bendlin, whose father was on board.\n\u201cWorst-case scenario, he dies.\u201d\nItaly has now surpassed China for total Covid-19 deaths: nearly 75,000 cases have been confirmed, and more than 7,500 people have died.\nBut cruise ships have posed acute problems for health authorities around the world. The inescapably confined nature of the vessels has seen them become rapid incubators of Covid-19.\nFor several days in February, the ill-fated Diamond Princess which was put into isolation in Yokohama Port, Japan, after isolated cases were detected on board, was the second-largest outbreak site for coronavirus in the world, behind mainland China.\nDuring a two-week enforced quarantine on board, nearly 700 people were infected, and seven died. The quarantine was abandoned and crew and passengers ultimately disembarked (most were placed into a further fortnight\u2019s quarantine in their home countries).\nCurrently, on board the Zaandam \u2013 carrying about 100 Australians and stranded off the west coast of South America \u2013 at least 80, and reportedly up to 140, passengers and crew are sick with flu-like symptoms. A quarter of the crew is reportedly quarantined and passengers are said to be \u201cterrified and stressed\u201d.\nThe ship is being replenished by another ship, Rotterdam, which will bring extra supplies, staff and Covid-19 test kits aboard (there are none at present). The ship intends to sail to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, to disembark by the end of the month.\nEven ships without any Covid-19 cases are being treated with extreme caution by ports around the world.\nThe Norwegian Jewel was turned away from four countries \u2013 including Australia \u2013 before being allowed to dock and passengers disembark in Hawaii, despite being at sea for weeks and having no suspected or confirmed cases.\nStung by the excoriating public reaction to infected Ruby Princess passengers being allowed to disembark unchecked in Sydney - Australian governments have tightened all movements for cruise ship passengers.\nNSW has said no ships will disembark in the state until new protocols are established, while the federal government has taken nearly 300 Australian passengers from the Norwegian Jewel flown back into Sydney from Hawaii overnight, into quarantine in a Sydney motel, guarded by police.\nAround the world, 3,000 Australians are stranded on more than 20 cruise ships because countries have shut their borders because of coronavirus.\nThe Australian government says it is aware of the dire situation faced by many of those onboard: the lack of ports for ships to dock and the rapidly shrinking avenues for repatriation once ashore.\nA Dfat spokesman said the department had raised concerns with Italian authorities about cruise ships disembarking passengers in areas already hard-hit by Covid-19, urging authorities to find safer alternative ports.\nThe foreign minister Marise Payne said her department was working \u201caround the clock\u201d to help Australians home. She said the government was speaking with Qantas and Virgin about launching repatriation missions for stranded Australians, but has conceded it will be impossible to reach all Australians who wish to come home.",

But the more you intervene to deal with the medical emergency, the more you put economies at risk.\u201d\nDuring the financial crisis, Brown persuaded other global leaders of the need to bail out the banks and then hosted a meeting of the G20 in London, which came up with a $1.1tn rescue package.\nDespite Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica first\u201d policy, he said it was still possible to get support for an emergency body with executive powers.\nBrown said his proposed global taskforce would fight the crisis on two fronts. There would need to be a coordinated effort to find a vaccine, and to organise production, purchasing and prevent profiteering.\nMany countries have announced economic packages in the past two weeks but Brown said a taskforce could: make sure the efforts of central banks were coordinated; take steps to prevent the record flight of capital from emerging market economies; and agree a joint approach to the use of government spending to boost growth.\nBrown said there had been resistance in 2008 to using the G20 as a vehicle for tackling the financial crisis, but that it should be clear to world leaders that there was no possibility of a go-it-alone approach working.\n\u201cWe need some sort of working executive,\u201d Brown said. \u201cIf I were doing it again, I would make the G20 a broader organisation because in the current circumstances you need to listen to the countries that are most affected, the countries that are making a difference and countries where there is the potential for a massive number of people to be affected - such as those in Africa.\u201d\nThe World Bank and the International Monetary Fund needed an increase in their financial firepower to cope with the impact of the crisis on low- and middle-income countries, he said.",

        "content": "Exclusive: Protectionist policies and shortage of workers could see problems start within weeks\nProtectionist measures by national governments during the coronavirus crisis could provoke food shortages around the world, the UN\u2019s food body has warned.\nHarvests have been good and the outlook for staple crops is promising, but a shortage of field workers brought on by the virus crisis and a move towards protectionism \u2013 tariffs and export bans \u2013 mean problems could quickly appear in the coming weeks, Maximo Torero, chief economist of the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, told the Guardian.\n\u201cThe worst that can happen is that governments restrict the flow of food,\u201d he said. \u201cAll measures against free trade will be counterproductive. Now is not the time for restrictions or putting in place trade barriers. Now is the time to protect the flow of food around the world.\u201d\nGovernments must resist calls from some quarters to protect their own food supply by restricting exports, he said, as some have begun to do.\nKazakhstan, for instance, according to a report from Bloomberg, has banned exports of wheat flour, of which it is one of the world\u2019s biggest sources, as well as restrictions on buckwheat and vegetables including onions, carrots and potatoes. Vietnam, the world\u2019s third biggest rice exporter, has temporarily suspended rice export contracts. Russia, the world\u2019s biggest wheat exporter, may also threaten to restrict exports, as it has done before, and the position of the US is in doubt given Donald Trump\u2019s eagerness for a trade war in other commodities.\n\u201cTrade barriers will create extreme volatility,\u201d warned Torero. \u201c[They] will make the situation worse. That\u2019s what we observe in food crises.\u201d\nWhile the supply of food is functioning well in most countries at present, problems could start to be seen within weeks and intensify over the following two months as key fruit and vegetables come into season. These types of produce often have short ripening times and are highly perishable, and need skilled pickers to work quickly at the right time.\n\u201cWe need to be careful not to break the food value chain and the logistics or we will be looking at problems with fresh vegetables and fruits soon,\u201d said Torero. \u201cFruit and vegetables are also very labour intensive, if the labour force is threatened because people can\u2019t move then you have a problem.\u201d\nAs governments impose lockdowns in countries across the world, recruiting seasonal workers will become impossible unless measures are taken to ensure vital workers can still move around, while preventing the virus from spreading.\n\u201cCoronavirus is affecting the labour force and the logistical problems are becoming very important,\u201d said Torero. \u201cWe need to have policies in place so the labour force can keep doing their job. Protect people too, but we need the labour force. Major countries have yet to implement these sorts of policies to ensure that food can keep moving.\u201d\nCountries such as the UK, with a sinking currency and high level of imports, are also likely to see food price rises unless the government takes action or retailers absorb some of the costs, he said.\nThe most important role governments can play is to keep the food supply chain operating, intervene to ensure there are enough workers, and keep the global food markets from panicking, according to Torero.\n\u201cIf traders start to become nervous, conditions will get difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just needs one big trader to make a decision [to disrupt the supply of staple crops] and that will affect everywhere. Governments must properly regulate, that is their biggest function in this situation. It\u2019s very important to keep alive the food value chain: intervene to protect the value chain [including the supply of workers] but not to distort the market.\u201d\nIndividuals can also play an important role, by avoiding panic buying and hoarding of food, and cutting down on food waste. Buying too much fresh farm produce that then goes off before it can be eaten will just exacerbate food supply problems, he said. \u201cIndividuals should only buy what they need to avoid food waste.\u201d\nAnimal welfare is also an issue as border delays caused by the Covid-19 lockdown measures are meaning that livestock journeys are lengthened.\nIn the UK, some farming leaders have called for a \u201cland army\u201d of workers to replace a shortfall of workers that could reach 80,000, according to one estimate, if the 60,000 seasonal workers recruited from abroad in normal years are prevented from coming, and if some British workers fall ill.\nOrganisations representing both wealthy landowners and agricultural workers have urged the government to intervene. The Landworkers\u2019 Alliance, representing more than 1,000 small and medium farmers and landworkers across the UK, wrote to the chancellor of the exchequer asking for a \u00a39.3m package of support to pay a \u201cland army\u201d of workers to increase domestic fruit and vegetable production as the Covid-19 crisis bites.\nThe Country Land and Business Association (CLA), representing more than 30,000 UK landowners and rural firms, made a similar call last week, for the government to make it easier for people thrown out of work by the lockdown to find seasonal work on farms. Mark Bridgeman, president of the CLA, said: \u201cWe need urgent government assistance to help source workers and advertise positions. Time is of the essence as many farmers will soon begin, or have already begun, planting or harvesting.\u201d\nThe Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has said its officials and ministers are in regular communication with representatives of the food industry to ensure the food supply chain remains resilient.\nAndre Laperriere, executive director of Global Open Data for Agriculture and Nutrition, which provides data on food and agriculture, said the government must make plans to ensure the food supply chain functioned smoothly.\n\u201cEmpty shelves in supermarkets should not be much of a concern,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not a supply problem \u2013 it is a logistics problem. There is enough supply for all, as long as everyone stays calm and stops hoarding. We may tend to waste food if we hoard more than required, and hoarding would also artificially increase food prices because of the pressure on the supply chain.\u201d\nHe called for borders between the UK and other countries to remain open for imports and exports, and for farm workers to be supplied with protective equipment to enable them to carry on with their jobs safely amid the coronavirus lockdown. \u201cThe food sector comes under the critical infrastructure sector, along with healthcare and emergency services,\u201d he said.",

        "content": "Offences including burglary and violence fall by as much as 20% in some areas\nThe coronavirus crisis has led to a drop in recorded crime, by as much as 20% in some areas.\nOffences such as burglary and violence were down last week compared with the previous seven days, after Boris Johnson made his first request for people to stay home on the Monday.\nThe fall this week could be even larger after the prime minister changed his pleas for social distancing into an order to stay inside.\nIn one force, Durham, rated by inspectors as one of the best in England, the drop in crime was 20%. Officers recorded an average of 130 crimes a day, as opposed to an average of 165 the previous week.\nStephen White, acting police and crime commissioner for Durham, said: \u201cSome people rely on shoplifting to fund their drug habit. That\u2019s harder as the shops are closed.\u201d\nWhile there are some local variations, crime levels are believed to be down across the country, as are calls to police through 999 and 101, as people heed pleas to use online services, which consume less police time.\nChief constable Andy Cooke, lead for the National Police Chiefs Council on crime, said the closure of pubs and clubs, which drive the night-time economy, and the fact that far more people were home for much more of the day were also cutting offences: \u201cThere is less violence from pub fights, less burglaries as everyone is at home.\u201d\nHowever, police believe crime may start to increase as the lockdown and restrictions continue. Cooke said: \u201cWhat you will see are increases in domestic violence, with people cooped up in the same home, and internet crime such as fraud and scams.\u201d\nCooke, who is also chief constable of Merseyside, said 7% of his force were already off because they had the virus or were self-isolating.\nIn Durham 6% of officers are absent, while Greater Manchester police have 10% absent.\nThe Metropolitan police, responsible for the coronavirus hotspot of London, already has an absence rate of 20%.\nHe said he feared a 25-30% absence rate at the outbreak\u2019s peak, with the force prepared to enact crisis measures and respond to 999 emergency calls only.\nCooke developed coronavirus symptoms himself two weeks ago and tested positive last week. \u201cThese are difficult and different times for policing, we are keeping a very close eye on it, we will move staff to different departments if we need to,\u201d he said.\nThe Merseyside force has lost 1,100 officers over the past 10 years as part of the government\u2019s austerity cuts. It is currently training 500 new recruits \u2013 who may be plucked out of the classroom and put on the beat before they officially qualify \u201cas a last resort\u201d, in less demanding roles such as guarding crime scenes, said Cooke.\nThe chief constable said he was worried about prisoners being released early from jail because of fears the virus could sweep through overcrowded prisons: \u201cIf they are coming out without tags, I would be very concerned. Even if they come out on tags, that leaves us - the police - to ensure they are where they should be, so puts an extra workload on the police. My preference would be that they aren\u2019t released early but it\u2019s not my decision.\u201d\nRegarding his own illness, he said it had \u201cknocked me sideways\u201d, having considered himself fit and with no underlying health issues. He insisted he had now largely recovered, barring \u201ca nasty cough\u201d which he had been assured was not infectious.\nThe 56-year-old said: \u201cIt started with a really high temperature, aches and pains. really tight chest, a really dry cough, headaches. That was the first three or four days.\n\u201cAnd then I thought I was getting through it and started to feel better for a day and a bit but it came back in the same way. Not so much the high temperature but the other symptoms were there. It was the first time I\u2019d been off sick for 20-odd years.\u201d\nIt had been impossible to trace everyone he might have infected, he said, because he had met \u201ctoo many people all over the country\u201d.\nCooke attended and spoke at the conference of police chiefs and police and crime commissioners in late February in central London.",

Mainland China and Hong Kong both reported an increase in new coronavirus cases involving travellers arriving from abroad. Health officials in China said it had 67 new cases but none of them were locally transmitted. The easing of travel restrictions has allowed 800 Beijing residents caught up in the Wuhan lockdown to go back home to the capital.\nA new wave of coronavirus cases in Tokyo has prompted the city\u2019s governor to urge residents to stay at home this weekend. Yuriko Koike described the situation as \u201csevere\u201d and asked people \u201cat all costs to refrain from going out this weekend if it\u2019s not urgent. Tokyo reported 41 new Covid-19 cases on Wednesday, the largest daily number in the capital. There are also concerns of a resurgence in Hong Kong where a health expert called for a curfew to handle returning cases. Thailand closed its borders on Wednesday and researchers estimate Indonesia may have thousands more cases than currently recorded as fears grow of an epidemic in the country of 260 million people.\nDonald Trump has accused the media of wanting to keep the US economy shut in order to harm his chances of being reelected in November. Repeating his wish to open up parts of the country by Easter, Trump used his daily press conference to blame reporters for trying to keep the economy weak. A sign of the problems facing the US economy came as California\u2019s governor said the state had received more than a million claims for unemployment this month due to the coronavirus crisis. The Senate passed the $2tr dollar stimulus package on Wednesday night but Trump\u2019s family will not be able to benefit from it, Democrats have insisted. The US now has almost 70,000 cases and more than 1,000 deaths.\nIn England, police will have the power to disperse people suspected of breaching stay-at-home rules. Ministers are expected to give more details on Thursday of how police will be authorised to first encourage people to go back indoors if they suspect them of being out of their home in breach of the ban. If that and the issuing of a fine fails, reasonable force could be used. Meanwhile, police report a huge drop in crime since the outbreak began.\nSpain is living through \u201cone of the darkest periods in its history\u201d as the coronavirus continues to sweep through the country. More people have now died in Spain \u2013 3,647 \u2013 than in China and the writer Giles Tremlett examines how it managed to respond so badly to a crisis that it knew was coming several weeks ago. Factors being blamed include complacency, poorly equipped hospitals and mild winter weather.\nAs G20 leaders prepare for a teleconference meeting on Thursday, the worsening state of the world economy will be very high on their agenda. Ratings agency Moody\u2019s said the G20 economies will experience an \u201cunprecedented shock\u201d in the first half of this year and will contract in 2020 as a whole. Singapore data suggests the city-state\u2019s economy will shrink 2% this quarter, which equates to a 10.6% slump over a full year, in figures that signal the onset of the global recession.\nKiwis began their first day under strict, stay-at-home conditions that will last four weeks, with the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, warning that Covid-19 numbers will rise \u2013 possibly into the thousands \u2013 before they drop. The country has 283 confirmed cases and no deaths from the coronavirus.",

Any accurate diagnosis of a virus like the coronavirus is left to medically untrained seafarers as well as ships masters who simply would not be familiar with the symptoms and diagnosis of coronavirus.\u201d\nGarrett told ABC radio on Thursday this warning was \u201cbasically ignored\u201d.\nThis email was sent on the 29 January, 50 days before the Ruby Princess was allowed to offload sick passengers in Sydney.\nAt least 166 Covid-19 cases have been linked to the ship.\nAs the crisis has progressed, and cruise liners announced a halting of services, many cruise ships have been left with nowhere to go once they offload passengers.\nThere are now dozens of ships sitting off the coast of Australia, including 11 docked in Sydney Harbour or anchored off Sydney and Wollongong, leaving crews stranded indefinitely, with little information available on how many have already been infected.\n\u201cThey are captured on board that ship and their opportunities to come home, even after their contracts have ended are very limited,\u201d said Dean Summers, the national coordinator for the International Transport Workers\u2019 Federation.\n\u201cOur main concerns are ensuring that they are fed, that they have medical treatment and that they are paid,\u201d he said.\nThe majority of cruise ships crew are recruited from developing nations such as the Philippines, Sri Lanka and India.\nAmong the ships are the Ruby Princess, Voyager of the Seas, Ovation of the Seas and Celebrity Solstice, all of which have recorded positive Covid-19 among its passengers.\nThe Martine Union of Australia said the numbers of crews on these vessels was likely in the thousands, and ships are know to be rapid incubators of coronavirus.\nThe union said the Australian government needed to be doing more to ensure crew members were safe.\n\u201cNSW health, border force, biosecurity whichever is the responsible state and federal government agency, go and get on board those ships, go and check the crew members out now, do it today \u2026 make sure they are healthy,\u201d Garret told ABC radio.\n\u201cIf they are unwell let\u2019s get them off and give them the healthcare they need.\u201d\nSummers said the International Transport Workers\u2019 Federation had not yet been contacted by any crew members off the coast of Australia, however, he added it may be difficult for crew members to complain if they are being mistreated.\n\u201cShip owners deliberately choose their seafarers from developing nations because they are low paid.\n\u201cI\u2019ve had crews off a merchant ship, if they complain, to the authorities, it\u2019s quite often the case when that ship comes back around that crew is gone and another nationality has replaced them.\u201d\nOn Thursday the New South Wales premier Gladys Berejiklian announced that no cruise ship passengers would be allowed to disembark in the state until stricter protocols were enacted.\n\u201cLet me be clear that the federal and state governments are working closely together to confirm the new stringent protocols. I can also confirm no one will be allowed to leave any of these cruise ships until we have settled on the agreed new measures,\u201d she said.\nThe Voyager of the Seas, currently off the coast of Wollongong, docked in Sydney on 18 March and seven passengers have so far tested positive for Covid-19. The Ovation of the Seas docked in Sydney on 14 March and has so far been linked to 13 cases. The Spectrum of the Seas, the Sun Princess and the Pacific Explorer remain in Sydney Harbour as of Thursday, with no confirmed cases. In Western Australia, seven passengers on the Artania off the coast of Fremantle have tested positive for the virus, with a total of 25 passengers and crew showing respiratory symptoms. Meanwhile, 800 Australians on the Vasco da Gama cruise ship will be quarantined on Rottnest Island after the government gave it permission to dock in Fremantle on Friday. Also off the coast of WA, the Magnifica cruise ship was allowed to refuel in Fremantle, but was refused permission to dock, after premier Mark McGowan said on Monday that more than 250 passengers on board had upper respiratory illnesses.Around the country, the Golden Princess and Viking Orion remain off the coast of Melbourne, the Queen Elizabeth off Gladstone, the Pacific Dawn is docked in Brisbane, and the Carnival Splendour, Radiance of the Seas, Sea Princess, Ruby Princess, Celebrity Solstice and Carnival Spirit all remain off the coast of NSW.\nThe NSW Port Authority and the Cruise Lines International Association have yet responded to Guardian Australia\u2019s request for comment.\nThe NSW premier\u2019s office did not respond to questions relating to how the government would assist sick crew members.",

He said he wears gloves and a mask at work but it is not enough. \u201cOnly God is enough,\u201d he added.\nA Nepalese labourer building a car park said his blood pressure is checked before each shift. \u201cI use a face mask, which I bought myself. Those who don\u2019t have a mask cover their mouth with a piece of cloth,\u201d he said.\nLast week, the Qatari authorities announced a \u201cban on all forms of gatherings \u2026 including but not limited to the Corniche, public parks, beaches and social gatherings\u201d, but despite an almost total shutdown of gyms, cinemas, shopping malls and banks, the ruling appears not to apply to construction workers and others in the private sector.\nNotices on the government\u2019s social media sites urging people to avoid public spaces and gatherings provoked an angry response, with one user writing: \u201cHow will construction workers maintain social distancing? \u2026 No one cares about our safety \u2026 Do you think we don\u2019t want to live? Do you think we don\u2019t want to see our families?\u201d\nAnother wrote that he was on the site for nine hours a day, adding: \u201cWe are not robots. We are not immune to the virus.\u201d\nMigrant workers in Qatar, and across the Gulf, are not allowed to change jobs without their employer\u2019s permission, a system some rights groups have described as a form of modern slavery. Legislation to end the practice was unveiled in October but has not yet come into force.\nMost migrant workers pay large recruitment fees, some as high as \u00a34,000, to secure jobs in Qatar. Many find their salaries are less than they were promised. Low pay and late pay are commonplace, but workers are reluctant to complain for fear they will lose their jobs.\n\u201cIt is hard for employees in any context to refuse to go to work, but in systems like Qatar, where employers have extreme levels of control over workers, it would be particularly risky,\u201d said James Lynch, a director at Fair/Square Research and Projects and an expert on migrant workers in Qatar. \u201cNew migration to Qatar has been halted as a result of the pandemic, so the impact of losing your job is now even worse than it would be anyway.\u201d\nThe number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in Qatar has now topped 500, with the vast majority migrant workers. The figure is the third highest in the Gulf, after Iran and Saudi Arabia.\nIn a statement, the Qatar government\u2019s communications office said the wellbeing of everyone in Qatar is of paramount concern. Testing for coronavirus is free for all and anyone who tests positive receives high-quality care at no cost, they said.\n\u201cThe government is in close coordination with employers to ensure that their health and safety is maintained. This includes working with companies to raise awareness for workers around preventive actions, including hygiene, sterilisation and cleaning of sites and buses, as well as controlled entry and exit to workplaces,\u201d the statement said.\nThe supreme committee, the body organising the World Cup, has been approached for comment.\nAdditional reporting by Roshan Sedhai",

        "content": "Pandemics have always shaped cities \u2013 and from increased surveillance to \u2018de-densification\u2019 to new community activism, Covid-19 is doing it already\nVictoria Embankment, which runs for a mile and a quarter along the River Thames, is many people\u2019s idea of quintessential London. Some of the earliest postcards sent in Britain depicted its broad promenades and resplendent gardens. The Metropolitan Board of Works, which oversaw its construction, hailed it as an \u201cappropriate, and appropriately civilised, cityscape for a prosperous commercial society\u201d.\nBut the embankment, now hardwired into our urban consciousness, is entirely the product of pandemic. Without a series of devastating global cholera outbreaks in the 19th century \u2013 including one in London in the early 1850s that claimed more than 10,000 lives \u2013 the need for a new, modern sewerage system may never have been identified. Joseph Bazalgette\u2019s remarkable feat of civil engineering, which was designed to carry waste water safely downriver and away from drinking supplies, would never have materialised.\nFrom the Athens plague in 430BC, which drove profound changes in the city\u2019s laws and identity, to the Black Death in the Middle Ages, which transformed the balance of class power in European societies, to the recent spate of Ebola epidemics across sub-Saharan Africa that illuminated the growing interconnectedness of today\u2019s hyper-globalised cities, public health crises rarely fail to leave their mark on a metropolis.\nAs the world continues to fight the rapid spread of coronavirus, confining many people to their homes and radically altering the way we move through, work in and think about our cities, some are wondering which of these adjustments will endure beyond the end of the pandemic, and what life might look like on the other side.\nOne of the most pressing questions that urban planners will face is the apparent tension between densification \u2013 the push towards cities becoming more concentrated, which is seen as essential to improving environmental sustainability \u2013 and disaggregation, the separating out of populations, which is one of the key tools currently being used to hold back infection transmission.\n\u201cAt the moment we are reducing density everywhere we can, and for good reason,\u201d observes Richard Sennett, a professor of urban studies at MIT and senior adviser to the UN on its climate change and cities programme. \u201cBut on the whole density is a good thing: denser cities are more energy efficient. So I think in the long term there is going to be a conflict between the competing demands of public health and the climate.\u201d\nSennett believes that in the future there will be a renewed focus on finding design solutions for individual buildings and wider neighbourhoods that enable people to socialise without being packed \u201csardine-like\u201d into compressed restaurants, bars and clubs \u2013 although, given the incredibly high cost of land in big cities like New York and Hong Kong, success here may depend on significant economic reforms as well.\nIn recent years, although cities in the global south are continuing to grow as a result of inward rural migration, northern cities are trending in the opposite direction, with more affluent residents taking advantage of remote working capabilities and moving to smaller towns and countryside settlements offering cheaper property and a higher quality of life.\nThe \u201cdeclining cost of distance\u201d, as Karen Harris, the managing director of Bain consultancy\u2019s Macro Trends Group, calls it, is likely to accelerate as a result of the coronavirus crisis. More companies are establishing systems that enable staff to work from home, and more workers are getting accustomed to it. \u201cThese are habits that are likely to persist,\u201d Harris says.\nThe implications for big cities are immense. If proximity to one\u2019s job is no longer a significant factor in deciding where to live, for example, then the appeal of the suburbs wanes; we could be heading towards a world in which existing city centres and far-flung \u201cnew villages\u201d rise in prominence, while traditional commuter belts fade away.\nAnother potential impact of coronavirus may be an intensification of digital infrastructure in our cities. South Korea, one of the countries worst-affected by the disease, has also posted some of the lowest mortality rates, an achievement that can be traced in part to a series of technological innovations \u2013 including, controversially, the mapping and publication of infected patients\u2019 movements.\nIn China, authorities have enlisted the help of tech firms such as Alibaba and Tencent to track the spread of Covid-19 and are using \u201cbig data\u201d analysis to anticipate where transmission clusters will emerge next. If one of the government takeaways from coronavirus is that \u201csmart cities\u201d including Songdo or Shenzhen are safer cities from a public health perspective, then we can expect greater efforts to digitally capture and record our behaviour in urban areas \u2013 and fiercer debates over the power such surveillance hands to corporations and states.\nIndeed, the spectre of creeping authoritarianism \u2013 as emergency disaster measures become normalised, or even permanent \u2013 should be at the forefront of our minds, says Sennett. \u201cIf you go back through history and look at the regulations brought in to control cities at times of crisis, from the French revolution to 9/11 in the US, many of them took years or even centuries to unravel,\u201d he says.\nAt a time of heightened ethnonationalism on the global stage, in which rightwing populists have assumed elected office in many countries from Brazil to the US, Hungary and India, one consequence of coronavirus could be an entrenchment of exclusionary political narratives, calling for new borders to be placed around urban communities \u2013 overseen by leaders who have the legal and technological capacity, and the political will, to build them.\nIn the past, after a widespread medical emergency, Jewish communities and other socially stigmatised groups such as those affected by leprosy have borne the brunt of public anger. References to the \u201cChina virus\u201d by Donald Trump suggest such grim scapegoating is likely to be a feature of this pandemic\u2019s aftermath as well.\nOn the ground, however, the story of coronavirus in many global cities has so far been very different. After decades of increasing atomisation, particularly among younger urban residents for whom the impossible cost of housing has made life both precarious and transient, the sudden proliferation of mutual aid groups \u2013 designed to provide community support for the most vulnerable during isolation \u2013 has brought neighbours together across age groups and demographic divides. Social distancing has, ironically, drawn some of us closer than ever before. Whether such groups survive beyond the end of coronavirus to have a meaningful impact on our urban future depends, in part, on what sort of political lessons we learn from the crisis.\nThe vulnerability of many fellow city dwellers \u2013 not just because of a temporary medical emergency but as an ongoing lived reality \u2013 has been thrown into sharp relief, from elderly people lacking sufficient social care to the low-paid and self-employed who have no financial buffer to fall back on, but upon whose work we all rely.\nA stronger sense of society as a collective whole, rather than an agglomeration of fragmented individuals, could lead to a long-term increase in public demands for more interventionist measures to protect citizens \u2013 a development that governments may find harder to resist given their readiness in the midst of coronavirus to override the primacy of markets.\nPrivate hospitals are already facing pressure to open up their beds without extra charge for those in need; in Los Angeles, homeless citizens have seized vacant homes, drawing support from some lawmakers. Will these kinds of sentiments dwindle with the passing of coronavirus, or will political support for urban policies that put community interests ahead of corporate ones \u2013 like a greater imposition of rent controls \u2013 endure?\nWe don\u2019t yet know the answer, but in the new and unpredictable connections swiftly being forged within our cities as a result of the pandemic, there is perhaps some cause for optimism. \u201cYou can\u2019t \u2018unknow\u2019 people,\u201d observes Harris, \u201cand usually that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d Sennett thinks we are potentially seeing a fundamental shift in urban social relations. \u201cCity residents are becoming aware of desires that they didn\u2019t realise they had before,\u201d he says, \u201cwhich is for more human contact, for links to people who are unlike themselves.\u201d Whether that change in the nature of city living proves to be as lasting as Bazalgette\u2019s sewer-pipe embankment remains, for now, to be seen.",

        "content": "With Katy Perry and Led Zeppelin\u2019s recent judgments reversing previous rulings, musicians don\u2019t know which way to tread \nHave you written a song? A song so memorable that everyone who hears it starts humming it? A song so good it feels as though it has been around forever and you simply plucked it from the ether? Then a word of advice: get an expert to listen to it. Because somewhere, someone is going to be sure your song was copied from theirs.\nAn old music industry adage holds that \u201cwhere there\u2019s a hit, there\u2019s a writ\u201d. It was true in 1963, when the Beach Boys released Surfin\u2019 USA, and Chuck Berry duly noted that the song was simply his own 1958 hit Sweet Little Sixteen with new lyrics (Berry\u2019s publisher, Arc Music, was granted the publishing rights, and from 1966 Berry was listed alongside Brian Wilson as a writer of the song). And it\u2019s especially true now after several recent cases.\nMarch alone saw two important judgments about music theft in appeals courts in California. First the ninth circuit court of appeals ruled that Led Zeppelin\u2019s Stairway to Heaven did not crib from Taurus by Spirit. Then a federal court overturned last year\u2019s jury verdict that Katy Perry\u2019s Dark Horse had stolen from the song Joyful Noise by the Christian rapper Flame.\nWhat\u2019s important, though, is not whether anyone was plagiarised, but whether a copyright was infringed. Plagiarism and copyright infringement \u201care related but they are distinctly different\u201d, says Peter Oxendale, who has been a professional forensic musicologist \u2013 someone who offers expert analysis of compositions for legal purposes \u2013 for more than 40 years.\n\u201cCopyright, for example, does not protect \u2018ideas\u2019 but rather the fixed \u2018detailed expression\u2019 of those ideas. Copyright infringement is a legal matter known as a tort,\u201d he says. \u201cPlagiarism, on the other hand, is an ethical matter and occurs when someone uses the ideas or works of someone else in their own work without giving the appropriate credit to the original source.\u201d The cases that come to court are not about plagiarism; they\u2019re about infringement of copyright.\nThe Zeppelin and Perry cases have been hailed as important because they appear to offer songwriters the latitude they seemed to have been denied by a crucial earlier trial. In December 2018 the long-running and highly controversial case involving the song Blurred Lines came to a close, when Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams, two of the song\u2019s writers, were ordered to pay just short of $5m to the estate of Marvin Gaye, for Blurred Lines\u2019 similarity to Gaye\u2019s 1977 song Got To Give It Up.\n\u201cBlurred Lines certainly stirred up the music community,\u201d says Joe Bennett, a forensic musicologist based at Berklee College of Music, in Boston. \u201cThe reason it had so many musicians concerned is that the two songs are demonstrably different in their melodies, lyrics, and underlying chords. It hasn\u2019t set a legal precedent exactly, because every plagiarism case is judged on its individual merits, and every comparison is different, but it certainly has shifted the culture among songwriters, and made many worried about unintentional similarity leading to unfair accusations of copyright infringement.\u201d\nWhat the Blurred Lines case did was to allow something previously unheard of: the notion that the \u201cfeel\u201d of a record could be copyrighted. Given that the musician who didn\u2019t want to replicate the feel of a beloved record, if not its chords and melody, has yet to be born, the verdict sent shudders through the industry.\n\u201cMuch of the feel of a song is created by instrumentation, production techniques and other elements that many people consider to not be part of the \u2018song\u2019 itself,\u201d says Peter Mason, a music law expert at the solicitors Wiggin LLP. \u201cThe difference is starkly demonstrated by comparing Blurred Lines to the Stairway to Heaven case, in which the jury was limited to considering only the notes of the composition, as registered at the US copyright office.\n\u201cTaking away the similarities in \u2018sound\u2019, \u2018feel\u2019 or \u2018playing style\u2019 reduced the similarity between the compositions. Importantly, much of what remained was commonplace and therefore not protected by copyright.\u201d\nNevertheless, says Oxendale, \u201cWe are aware of a number of well-known clients who have been told to never cite the source of their inspiration in public or in print. This, in my view, has resulted in the stifling of creativity to the extent that inspiration is now being confused with appropriation.\n\u201cConversely, we are also seeing a growing number of instructions from clients who wish to pursue claims for infringement of copyright based on the use of nothing more than similar musical or lyrical \u2018ideas\u2019. I believe the Blurred Lines verdict has had a significant impact on the music industry as a whole and this is reflected in the number of cases coming into our office.\u201d\nFor all the high-profile court cases, though, many music copyright infringement claims never see the light of day. One major star \u2013 who must remain nameless \u2013 employed a musicologist for the specific purpose of listening to new releases in order to note any resemblance to their own works. The writer of any offending song received a polite note expressing the desire to avoid any embarrassment, and suggesting the whole matter might be resolved by a payment, without the need to shame the writer by going public or forcing a change to the songwriting credits.\nSince the Blurred Lines case, notes Mason, other songwriters have pre-empted litigation by adding writers who might conceivably have had a claim to writing credits \u2013 famously, Mark Ronson\u2019s worldwide hit Uptown Funk ended up with 11 writers. \u201cThe average number of writers on hit songs has increased dramatically over the last five years or so,\u201d Mason says, \u201cand part of this is due to composers agreeing to add the authors of past songs that are somewhat similar.\u201d\nWhy, though, do all the best-known copyright infringement cases come from the worlds of pop and rock? After all, one rarely hears of classical composers fighting it out in court, or jazz players arguing furiously about whether one has ripped off the other\u2019s saxophone solo.\n\u201cI think there are two reasons,\u201d Bennett says. \u201cFirst, popular song is a constrained art form, with a palette of statistically predictable phrase lengths, song forms, scale and chord choices, lyric tropes and song durations. These norms are largely defined by market forces, through massed listener preferences over time affecting the kind of creative decisions that songwriters are likely to make.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a type of cultural Darwinism, in a sense, but that\u2019s not to diminish the songwriter\u2019s art \u2013 writing a world-class hit is incredibly difficult, and needs everyone in the artist\u2019s production team to excel.\n\u201cSecond, pop is where the money is. A plagiarism lawsuit is a financial matter \u2013 party A is pursuing party B for compensation, so there\u2019s little point in going after someone whose work has not generated significant income.\u201d\nYou might think, of course, that musicians and songwriters are pinching from each other all the time \u2013 we\u2019ve all listened to songs and been reminded of something else. There are some artists, in fact, who seem to have made careers out of sounding like someone else: neither ELO nor Oasis would deny their respective debts to the Beatles.\nSometimes, though, musicians don\u2019t even realise they are borrowing. On a recent edition of the Reply All podcast, Prince\u2019s longtime recording engineer Susan Rogers remembered him sitting at the piano and picking out a melody. He liked it, he noted. But had it already been written?\nSubconscious recollection is called cyrptomnesia, and it has been responsible for some notable copyright infringements: in the 1976 case where George Harrison was sued for the similarity of My Sweet Lord to the Chiffons\u2019 He\u2019s So Fine, the judge described the similarity as an example of unconscious copying. Sam Smith\u2019s Stay With Me ended up getting Tom Petty and Jeff Lynne added to its writing credits, because of its similarity to their song Won\u2019t Back Down, and Petty observed, without rancour: \u201cAll my years of songwriting have shown me these things can happen. Most times you catch it before it gets out the studio door but in this case it got by.\u201d\nAs Bennett puts it: \u201cMost melodic similarity is coincidental, and most accusations of melodic plagiarism are unfounded. In the rare cases when the similarity is so striking that it appears to be evidence of plagiarism, then yes \u2013 it\u2019s usually unintentional. Songwriters have almost zero incentive to copy melodies verbatim, and enormous economic disincentives to do so.\u201d\nThe miracle, perhaps, is not that there are so many accusations of musical copyright infringement, but so few. Consider that thereare just 12 semitones in an octave. Or think about how many songs that derive from the blues use the 1-4-5 chord progression (Twist and Shout; Blitzkrieg Bop; Louie Louie and Wild Thing \u2013 and thousands more). What makes a song special is not its chords, or its top-line melody, or its lyrics, or its feel. It is how it combines all those elements.\n\u201cListeners don\u2019t hear songs as simple linear sequences of pitches \u2013 they hear everything all at once, and it\u2019s that combination of elements, in a recording or at a live show, that produces the powerful emotional response that we find so intoxicating,\u201d Joe Bennett says. \u201cIf the cultural value of a song subsisted only in its melody, the world wouldn\u2019t need performers, lyricists, producers, or artists.\u201d\nAnd, as everyone sitting in their living room gazing at the empty world outside knows, the word really does need all those people, for the sake of its sanity.\n This article was amended on 16 March 2022 to note in the caption of the 1970 photo that one of the musicians pictured is Sandy Denny, formerly of Fairport Convention.

        "content": "A summary of the major developments in the coronavirus outbreak across Australia\nVictoria has recorded its first coronavirus deaths, with authorities confirming three people diagnosed with Covid-19 have died in the past 24 hours. All three of the victims were men aged in their 70s. Meanwhile, a second man has died from Covid-19 in Western Australia.\nThe national death toll now stands at 13 people.\nVictoria\u2019s health minister, Jenny Mikakos, said: \u201cAll died in a Melbourne hospital and, of course, I am urging everyone to respect the privacy of the families during this difficult time.\n\u201cWe all have a role to play in the fight against coronavirus and this means we must all take very seriously the message that we must stay home unless it is absolutely essential to leave your home. You must stay at home at every opportunity.\u201d\nAn additional 15,000 people were thrown out of work due to the coronavirus crisis.\nSolomon Lew\u2019s retail group Premier Investments, which owns the stationery brand Smiggle and clothing chains including Just Jeans, Portmans and Dotti, will close all its stores at 6pm on Thursday, standing down 9,000 people. Premier said stores would remain closed until at least 22 April. It also told its landlords it would not be paying the rent during this period.\nTravel agent Flight Centre will stand down or sack 6,000 people, including 3,800 Australian staff. Flight Centre said that some of the Australian staff put out of a job would be made redundant, but did not provide numbers.\n\u201cIn Australia, where international travel bans and domestic border controls are in place, about 3,800 people in sales and support roles will temporarily stand down in the near-term,\u201d the company told the ASX.\nThe national cabinet decided on Wednesday night to relax the rules around hairdressers and barbers, revoking the rule announced the previous day that appointments must be kept to 30 minutes. But the backflip was subsequently labelled \u201cbonkers\u201d by the boss of the largest hairdressing chain in the country, who said social distancing rules made their work untenable.\nJust Cuts chief executive Denis McFadden said it was physically impossible for stylists to do their job while observing the rule of 4 sq metres per person, which will still be strictly enforced. McFadden said that without hairdressing on the shutdown list, it was difficult for franchise owners to stand down workers and close their doors.\nThe New South Wales health department has ordered nurses and biosecurity staff at Sydney airport to temperature check all incoming passengers, escalating that state\u2019s response to combat the spread of Covid-19 above and beyond commonwealth rules.\nThe directive, approved by health minister Brad Hazzard, was sent on Thursday, causing delays at Sydney airport and prompting concern from the Community and Public Sector Union and others that social distancing is not being observed in the arrival hall.\nThe border between Queensland and NSW was declared \u201cclosed\u201d on Thursday for the first time since the Spanish Flu outbreak of 1919. Police patrolled only the main highway routes to the north, and just a few cars were turned around at those checkpoints.\nPolice said on Thursday morning their \u201cmethodology\u201d for enforcing border closures would change regularly but that they had initially decided not to install roadblocks and checkpoints on streets linking Coolangatta and Tweed Heads.\nGladys Berejiklian said on Thursday she was ready to move ahead of the commonwealth if required and declare over the weekend a lockdown across NSW.\nThe number of NSW coronavirus cases jumped on Thursday to 1219, a rise of 190 on the previous day. Some 16 patients are in intensive care, with 10 requiring ventilators. Two more children in NSW \u2013 girls aged one and two \u2013 were confirmed on Thursday to have Covid-19, taking the number of child cases to four.\nBerejiklian also said the government was \u201clooking very closely\u201d at the impact of Monday\u2019s shutdowns on pubs, cinemas and churches - and if they were not sufficient, further action would be taken.\nLeaders in Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia announced on Thursday that school holidays would be brought forward, in a similar move to what Victoria and the ACT have already done.\nTeachers will still be at schools so parents who have essential jobs, such as healthcare workers and people who stack supermarket shelves, can send their children. But all other students are being asked to stay home. Schools will return after the holidays with distance education.\nThe Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said heath advice that has kept schools open so far had not changed, but the pupil-free directive provides the right balance given community concerns.\nNSW schools remain open but the premier urged parents to keep their children at home if possible.\nThe federal government has begun urgent discussions with the carmaker Ford to help boost ventilator stocks and is investigating whether veterinary equipment and sleep apnoea machines can be converted for use in the Covid-19 pandemic.\nAustralia currently has 2,300 ventilators in intensive care units across the hospital system, has surge capacity for another 5,000 and is seeking to dramatically boost stocks.\nThe coronavirus crisis is placing immense pressure on the global availability of ventilators, which are needed to pump oxygen into the failing lungs of critically ill patients.\nSeven passengers aboard the Artania anchored off Perth have tested positive for coronavirus, and the Western Australian premier, Mark McGowan, is adamant the federal government must manage the sick and help make the cruise ship leave.\nThere are no Australians on the vessel or on the cruise ship Magnifica, which is also anchored off WA and not allowed to dock but does not have any reported cases.\nMcGowan said the Artania must \u201curgently\u201d continue on to its next port in South Africa. He said the seven cases were all European, largely German, and he urged the federal government to consider arranging mercy flights with their home country.\nMeanwhile, the Vasco da Gama, which was scheduled to arrive in Fremantle on Friday, has been told to hold off until Monday while Rottnest Island is prepared as a 14-day quarantine zone for about 200 West Australians.",

        "content": "Victims and relatives of those killed in New Zealand mass shooting had been preparing for a brutal trial, but then the news came\nThose injured or bereaved in the Christchurch attacks on 15 March only found out about the court hearing when their phones started buzzing with calls and messages after it had finished. They felt joy, relief, and utter shock.\n\u201cIt was completely out of the blue,\u201d says Aya Al-Umari, 34, whose brother Hussein Al-Umari, then 35, was killed at Al Noor mosque last year. The gunman had initially pleaded not guilty to the counts of murder, attempted murder, and terrorism, with a lengthy trial due to begin in June. On Thursday, he abruptly changed his plea to guilty.\nAl-Umari scarcely believes the news, which arrived when she had just finished her morning prayers, in which she asked that justice would be served in the case.\n\u201cThis is one of the things I pray for, periodically I don\u2019t but today I did,\u201d she says. Then a message arrived telling her the gunman had pleaded guilty. \u201cI thought \u2013 that was fast. The line of communication must have been open.\u201d\nThe gunman \u2013 who broadcast footage of his attacks live on Facebook, and posted a manifesto seeking an audience for his white supremacist views and killing spree \u2013 admitted to his crimes in front of just 17 people, each sitting considerable distances apart to avoid the risk posed by coronavirus. He had written of his plans to use his trial as a platform for his views, so for many, including Al-Umari, his sudden change of mind was bewildering.\n\u201cIt\u2019s good but I\u2019m conflicted because now I have more questions than I have answers,\u201d she says. \u201cBut in a good way.\u201d\n\u201cNow that he is accepting he is guilty he is saving lots of people\u2019s time,\u201d says Temel Atacocugu, who survived nine bullets from the killer in Al Noor mosque.\nThursday\u2019s hearing at the Christchurch high court was so hastily convened that reporters were told of it only on Wednesday evening and most of the survivors and bereaved families were unaware it was happening. Because of New Zealand\u2019s strict lockdown measures, which came into effect at midnight and prevent people leaving their homes except for essential purposes, just two representatives of the Muslim community were permitted to attend: the imams of the two attacked mosques, both of whom were present during the attacks.\nPrivately, some of those affected asked why they had not been allowed to watch proceedings by video call, and why they had not been given more warning of the hearing or its content. Most heard of the guilty pleas 10 minutes before the media reported them, and some learned the news from reporters.\nBut most were happy the ordeal of the court process was over bar the sentencing, which will take place when the national lockdown is over.\nNoraini Abbas, who survived the attacks at Al Noor where her son, Sayyad Milne, 14, was killed, says the admission of guilt was \u201ca blessing\u201d.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to think anything about him. To me, he killed my son, and to me, he\u2019s already dead,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel that the punishment is really enough that he feels guilty. I don\u2019t care any more.\u201d\nAtacocugu says it is \u201cvery important\u201d the killer receive \u201cthe highest punishment ever seen in New Zealand history\u201d. \u201cIt needs to show people that terrorism is not acceptable in New Zealand.\u201d\nNo one has ever been sentenced to life with no chance of parole in New Zealand before.\nMaysoon Salama, whose son, Atta Elayyan, was killed at Al Noor and whose husband was badly injured, was earlier part of a group petitioning the government to allow the death penalty. They had been told that would not be considered.\n\u201cAccording to Islam the punishment is really that he doesn\u2019t deserve to be alive because he gave himself the permission to take the soul of not only one, but 51,\u201d she says.\nWhen the Guardian visited Christchurch last month, ahead of the one-year anniversary of the attacks on 15 March, conversation frequently turned to the bewilderment, anxiety, and at times defiance survivors and bereaved relatives felt before the trial. At the time, those comments could not be reported because they risked affecting the accused\u2019s right to be treated as innocent until proven guilty.\nThe case had presented a challenge to reporters: suppression orders, and the man\u2019s right to a fair trial, had to be respected \u2013 even though the gunman had broadcasted the attack live on Facebook in a video posted under his name that also showed his face.\nAfter his court appearances, survivors and the bereaved often stopped outside the courthouse to vent their frustrations to journalists, in comments that also could not be reported.\nIn October, Wasseim Alsati \u2013 who was shot along with his four-year-old daughter at Al Noor \u2013 lamented that the gunman was distressing the families by smiling and laughing during his hearings.\n\u201cWhen he is pleading not guilty, he\u2019s saying that there\u2019s nothing bad that he has done,\u201d Alsati said at the time. \u201cAnd by law he\u2019s got the right to do that. But what about the others? What are their rights? Is it our rights to just be patient and see him happy all that time?\u201d\nOn Thursday, the thoughts of victims turned to what they might say at the sentencing, which has been set nominally for 1 May, but could be held later because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Many said they were keen to speak and some already knew what they would say, including Temel Atacocugu.\n\u201cWe are the winners and you are the loser,\u201d he said.",

        "content": "Scott Morrison will also urge G20 leaders to keep borders open for trade of crucial medical supplies during Covid-19 pandemic\n Follow our latest Australia coronavirus blog for live news and updates\nScott Morrison will urge G20 leaders to fund rapid research to develop a coronavirus vaccine and support trials of anti-viral drugs, while keeping borders open to ensure critical medical supplies can be traded during the crisis.\nWith 80 countries seeking assistance from the International Monetary Fund to manage the economic shock triggered by the pandemic, and with G20 finance ministers predicting a global economic downturn, Australia\u2019s prime minister will use a teleconference of world leaders scheduled for late Thursday night to call on rich countries to support the developing world to help lower the death count in countries with poor health systems, and also minimise the risk of failed states.\nMorrison will say Australia intends to assist the Pacific as much as possible during the pandemic.\nThe G20 hookup comes as the Morrison government is working up a third round of safety net measures on the assumption that swathes of the economy will move into a period of suspended animation as lockdowns take effect. Conceptually, the government wants to ensure that businesses emerge on the other side of the pandemic without substantial liabilities on their books that would force them to either declare bankruptcy or sack substantial numbers of workers.\nMorrison will also meet the premiers on Friday at the national cabinet. New South Wales, Victoria and the ACT have signalled they will move to stage 3 lockdowns over the coming days in an effort to contain community transmission, and Friday\u2019s meeting will consider specific trigger points for that decision.\nWith the number of reported coronavirus cases in Australia creeping towards 3,000, governments are keeping a close watch on the number of infections that are locally acquired with no known link to a confirmed case. Official data seen by Guardian Australia indicates there were 115 cases in that category on Thursday, with a further 432 cases under investigation.\nAs of Thursday night, it appeared unlikely that stage 3 lockdowns would be imposed in the most populous states before the weekend, and the Morrison government wants to stretch the time before that happens as long as possible. Data collected by the government through the Citymapper app points to a substantial drop off in movement around cities since the government closed the border, and restrictions on crowds were imposed in mid-March.\nAs well as establishing the trigger points for the next sequence of lockdowns, Friday\u2019s meeting will also consider as yet uncompleted work on financial assistance measures for renters and landlords. The nuts and bolts of that package are being worked up by treasurers, with the states responsible for residential tenancies and the commonwealth dealing with commercial landlords and renters.\nThe states are looking to ensure that residential tenants don\u2019t get evicted over the coming months if they cannot pay their rent and will propose options to ensure there are no rent increases during the crisis.\nThe Morrison government wants the states to offer land tax relief for landlords, but is unlikely to get the states on board. The commonwealth is considering tax relief for landlords prepared to either cut rent or provide rent holidays for their tenants.\nThe treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, is also prevailing on the banks to help carry the load of suspended rental income for the duration of the crisis. The insurance industry has also been in talks with the Morrison government over the rent package.\nIt is believed insurers are concerned they may be on the hook for hundreds of millions of dollars in payments under landlord insurance policies. The insurance covers landlords for a variety of problems, including non-payment of rent. It is believed most policies do not exclude non-payment caused by a pandemic.\n \u201cThe insurance industry is aware of discussions around the impact of Covid-19 on commercial and domestic rents and is talking to government about the issue,\u201d an Insurance Council of Australia spokesman said.\nAlso on the agenda for Friday\u2019s national cabinet meeting is a conversation about reducing the amount of elective dental surgery to free up protective equipment. There will also be another conversation about schools in an effort to land on a national position.\nMorrison held talks with education unions this week and is attempting to broker arrangements where schools around the country move to provide distance learning by term two but campuses remain open for students who need to attend because their parents are essential services workers, or because they are in disadvantaged households.\nWith the economy already profoundly disrupted by the pandemic, business and unions are attempting to recalibrate industrial arrangements. On Thursday, two peak employer groups struck a deal with the Australian Services Union to vary the clerks award in a bid to keep hundreds of thousands in work by improving flexibility.\nThe deal, struck with the Australian Industry Group and Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, allows employees and employers to change the ordinary hours of work to better allow working from home. It also gives more power for employers to direct employees to take annual leave and more options for longer periods of leave at reduced pay to manage the downturn.\nPressure from peak business groups to adopt some form of wage subsidy to keep workers in employment on top of grants of up to $25,000 continued to grow on Thursday.\nThe Council of Small Business Organisations Australia chief executive, Peter Strong, told Guardian Australia it wanted a 60% wage subsidy, which together with existing grants worth 20% of employers\u2019 wages bill would deliver income support equivalent to the 80% adopted in the United Kingdom. The measure, which would cost $21bn for three months assuming 1.7m Australians are displaced from their jobs, was one proposal put to treasury officials at a meeting on Wednesday.\nThe government is examining wage subsidies for the third round of stimulus but is reluctant to adopt income support that gives more assistance to higher income earners than workers on average incomes or minimum wages. It also wants to deliver support through the existing tax and transfer system.\nThe finance minister, Mathias Cormann, said the government had not adopted a wage guarantee because \u201cthe advice in front of us was that that was not the best way in an Australian context\u201d to provide support, because \u201cthe existing jobseeker payment framework\u201d \u2013 unemployment benefits \u2013 would reach households faster.\nThe government is yet to respond to Labor\u2019s call to change the income threshold and taper rates for unemployment benefits so more families are able to access jobseeker payments where one partner is jobless but the other earns more than $48,000.\nOptions are still being developed by the social services minister, Anne Ruston, and the government characterises an agreement between the prime minister and the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, as a commitment only to consider changes with a view to expanding eligibility.",

        "content": "Businesses that revitalized neighborhoods, selling everything from books to artisanal cheese, are under threat as coronavirus keeps customers away\nThe ice-cream shop Island Pops in Brooklyn usually sees its business pick up from a winter lull this time of year, when the days are longer and the spring weather sets in.\nInstead, its doors are closed to walk-in customers at the order of health authorities hoping to stem the spread of coronavirus by keeping people in New York City out of restaurants, bars, gyms and movie theaters.\nAcross the US small businesses selling coffee, cakes, pilates classes, books and artisanal cheese have popped up over the last decade, changing neighborhoods for the better, revitalizing downtowns. Now all that is under threat.\nLoyal customers \u2013 and some big businesses \u2013 are trying to help. Buying gift cards, making donations. But on its current trajectory the scale this unprecedented crisis means many of these businesses just won\u2019t survive.\nCities and states across the US this week issued similar orders to close restaurants to dine-in customers and close businesses which create crowds, leaving small businesses such as Island Pops uncertain how long it can go on.\n\u201cThe government should understand that, one, we aren\u2019t making it,\u201d said Shelly Marshal, Island Pops\u2019 co-owner. \u201cAnd two, if we have to close up, there are five or six people who have to go home without pay. If they can bail the big banks out they can definitely bail small businesses out.\u201d\nSmall businesses are the anchor of the US economy and employed 58.9 million people in 2015. Governments are introducing measures to help ease the burden of forced closures, but business owners are worried that help is coming too little too late as they see an immediate drop in business.\nLike countless other businesses, Island Pops is encouraging customers to buy gift cards to use after the crisis passes to try to stem immediate losses. Otherwise, their only other income stream is delivery and pickup orders.\n\u201cEven that won\u2019t take us through the month for our responsibilities,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cWe have staff, of course we have rent, we have insurance, we have everything that still needs to be paid and we\u2019ve gone through our emergency fund, which is our winter fund.\u201d\nAs of Thursday morning, Marshall said it was unlikely the business could meet the minimum amount of pints it needs to sell each week. It has even become hard to rely on loyal customers, because they too are losing their jobs, or fearful a recession will limit their funds too.\nMarshall said her neighborhood, a gentrifying part of Brooklyn with a lively food and drink scene, has been a \u201cghost town\u201d this week. During one shift, she commiserated with an independent coffee shop owner, who told her at 2pm she was his fifth customer of the day, after opening at 6am.\nPatrick FitzGerald, a lecturer at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton Business School, said while people might think the world is technology-focused, small businesses depend on in-person interactions.\n\u201cThe reality is for 90% of small businesses, it\u2019s face-to-face, one-on-one, transactions,\u201d FitzGerald said. \u201cAnd at the moment, those have all, for the most part have stalled, so the impact is highly dramatic.\u201d\nTechnological advances can help, however, and FitzGerald said for any business which has been toying with using video conferencing, at-home delivery or pre-purchasing: \u201cThe time is now to deploy those.\u201d\nThe federal and local governments are also trying to help. The US Small Business Administration (SBA) said it would provide businesses with up to $2m in low-interest loans to keep them afloat. And New York City is one of several local governments offering loan and grant programs to local businesses.\nFacebook pledged $100m in grants to impacted stores and restaurants, though the company said it would only start taking applications \u201cin the coming weeks\u201d. Other corporations are also offering services to ease the burden on small businesses, but these efforts don\u2019t address the urgent need to replace the cashflow that comes from someone walking in the door.\nSo small business are taking creative steps to sell amid a disease outbreak.\nRetailers big and small are promoting free and discounted shipping offers. Major chains and local grocery stores have instituted special hours for senior shoppers, who are more vulnerable to a severe coronavirus infection. Yoga studios and boxing gyms have moved classes online.\nCapitol Hill bookstore in Washington DC closed its store to walk-in customers, but offered private, one-hour appointments for up to four would-be book buyers at a time.\n\u201cWe have to do everything in our power to continue our operations, and keep people employed and keep our business viable, at the same time we don\u2019t want to do anything to harm our employer or our customers, or the community at-large,\u201d co-owner Kyle Burk told NPR.\nThese moves are being made even as restaurants and nightclubs are forced to sharply cut staff.\nAlso in Washington DC, a \u201cvirtual tip jar\u201d was created to allow people to support service workers at local restaurants, hotels and nightclubs who were either laid off, not being paid temporarily or not receiving tips. Other businesses are turning to crowdfunding websites to raise money for their former staff while still trying to keep their doors open.\nIn New York City, the beloved Frankies Spuntino Group is trying to raise $100,000 for the employees it has had to put out of work. \u201cWe\u2019re all navigating uncharted territory right now, so we cannot tell you how much we appreciate your consideration,\u201d wrote the co-owners, Frank Castronovo and Frank Falcinelli.\nBefore closing indefinitely on Friday, it expanded the pick-up and delivery menu. Its handmade pasta, pesto and marinara sauce were sold to at-home chefs. The restaurant also sold martini and negroni kits \u2013 the byproduct of an emergency law change to help food businesses during the outbreak.\nPreviously, only beer could be sold for take-out in New York, but the state liquor board relaxed its laws to allow businesses with liquor licenses to sell liquor and wine to customers who also purchase food.\nThe Brooklyn cocktail and dessert bar Butter & Scotch had to lay off its entire staff on Monday before closing indefinitely on Thursday. In the few days between, the owner, Keavy Landreth, and the general manager, Stephanie Gallardo, who had been laid off, baked cookies and cakes for to-go orders. They also put together cocktail kits so people could emulate the sweet and boozy experience at home.\n\u201cThe kits were a last-ditch effort to get some more cash on hand to make sure we could pay our employees and selves before closing fully,\u201d Landreth said in an email. \u201cHad I known they were going to be such a hit I would have tried to make more but there was only so much we could do with two people. Hopefully this new alcohol to-go law sticks around and we can get these cocktail kits off the ground again.\u201d\nIsland Pops\u2019 Marshall, who was inspired to start the business with her husband after craving the traditional Caribbean soursop ice-cream while sick with another virus, chikungunya, said small businesses are the \u201clifeblood of the economy\u201d and need all the help they can get.\n\u201cWe employ a significant amount of employees and we create a ton of employment,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cIf they don\u2019t see that, it\u2019s a huge problem in the system.\u201d",

Sheriff Alex Villanueva told FOX 11 the county legal counsel had issued an opinion that under Governor Gavin Newsom\u2019s statewide executive order, gun stores should be classified as essential.",

        "content": "An accurate count is essential to obtain federal funding needed to get people off the streets\nFor the past year and a half, local county census committees and homeless service providers throughout California have been conducting their own outreach for the 2020 census, knowing that only an accurate count of the state\u2019s growing homeless population will guarantee the federal funding needed to get people off the streets and into stability.\nBecause even before the US coronavirus crisis prompted shelter-in-place orders and the suspension of 2020 census field operations nationwide, casting doubt on the operations for the once-in-a-decade count, they were preparing for the federal Census Bureau to significantly undercount the homeless population.\nWhile homelessness has soared, particularly in California, census staffers said plans in place to count the population were insufficient and disorganized. The federal bureau had limited the hours of targeted counting to between midnight and 7am. There was little or varied communication around cultural facilitation led by service providers or homeless representatives who act as a guide for enumerators, to smooth the process. Two weeks from 1 April, census day, when thousands of enumerators were set to flood the streets to conduct the count, some field offices were still not fully staffed.\nIn yet another sign of the disarray, a script sent out to some field offices in February directed enumerators to ask people about their citizenship status, despite a supreme court ruling rejecting the federal government\u2019s reasoning for the question.\n\u201cForget Covid-19,\u201d said a Los Angeles-based regional census manager who asked to only be identified as Maria. \u201cIt was going to be a dramatic undercount already.\u201d\nWith the additional stress and uncertainty of the coronavirus crisis, the homeless community on the move in attempts to stay safe, and local county census workers unable to do their own outreach, a vulnerable population stands to suffer from an even more broken process. So, too, will the municipalities where those people live, and the state in turn, as census population data is used to determine federal resources and political representation.\n\u201cIt feels like the people who need the resources, the representation, the money the most are becoming an afterthought,\u201d Maria said.\n\u201cI know we\u2019re in a crisis,\u201d she continued. \u201cBut this affects everything. There are no do-overs. Whatever the count is, it\u2019s the count for 10 years.\u201d\nThe Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s 2019 homeless assessment tallied more than 151,000 homeless people in California, a 16.4% increase from the year before. California\u2019s unhoused population made up more than a quarter of the nation\u2019s total count of 568,000.\nWith no fixed address and little trust in the government, the homeless population has always been notoriously difficult to track. \u201cIt\u2019s a population that\u2019s very leery of the government,\u201d said Candice Elder, the founder and executive director of the not-for-profit East Oakland Collective.\nCommunity advocates throughout the state knew that now, more than ever, with the population growing, the Census Bureau needed to get an accurate count of California\u2019s unhoused. In the year and half leading up to the count, however, local census committees came to understand that it would be on them to make sure their homeless populations were accurately counted.\n\u201cOur whole strategy in San Francisco has been to not rely on the Census Bureau to count during that time, and relying instead on informing people they could do the census on their own and highlighting our network of census help centers,\u201d said Robert Clinton, San Francisco\u2019s 2020 census project manager.\nWhile the census falls under the umbrella of the federal Census Bureau in Washington, jurisdictions have the option to form their own committees to work with the regional offices \u2013 something the federal bureau has recommended.\nBefore the coronavirus crisis, the federal Census Bureau planned on counting people experiencing homelessness from 30 March to 1 April. From 3 February to 6 March, the bureau was supposed to be working with local advocates to identify shelters, soup kitchens and other service providers, as well as well-known encampments and hotspots where the unhoused frequent.\nOn 30 and 31 March, the enumerators planned to conduct the service-based survey, going to the shelters and soup kitchens to count the population. On Census Day, the plan was to conduct the targeted non-sheltered outdoor location counting, going to the encampments and talking to people on the streets directly.\nCommunication continually broke down between the federal bureau and the San Francisco census committee, Clinton said, whether over verifying service sites, clarifying cultural sensitivity training or just going over how enumerators would count and collect information from each location.\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult because the people who work in San Francisco, the Census Bureau staff on the ground here, they have really good intentions,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cBut it\u2019s clear that this administration is not trying to count everyone in the US.\u201d\nThe federal Census Bureau did not respond to requests for comment.\nIn November, a group of advocates in Alameda county, some serving on the county\u2019s complete count committee, sent a letter to the area manager of the Los Angeles regional office, which oversees California, Hawaii, Alaska, Nevada, Oregon, Washington and Idaho.\n\u201cWe have shared the operational plans provided by the US Census Bureau with the homeless service providers and advocates in our community,\u201d the letter reads. \u201cThey have expressed significant concern. They believe that current operational plans will yield a significant undercount.\u201d\nAt the top of their concerns was the move to run encampment and street enumeration from midnight on 1 April to 7am. \u201cWho wants to be woken up in the middle of the night in their tent, RV or tiny home, by a census enumerator?\u201d said Elder of East Oakland Collective. \u201cJust out of pure respect, don\u2019t do that. People are on high alert at night.\u201d\n\u201cImagine just plain and simple the amount of people you will miss, even with the best enumerators,\u201d longtime census worker Maria said. \u201cHow can you count everyone at 1 o\u2019clock in the morning? It\u2019s going to be a radical undercount.\u201d\nThe citizenship question in the script the bureau sent out to some field offices would only further alienate the homeless population, Elder said. \u201cYou have a lot of undocumented unhoused residents who may not complete the census out of fear of being reported to immigration,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had to reassure people, and tell them that the census is not going to be reported to law enforcement.\u201d\nA 10 February email from the Los Angeles regional office moved to correct the inclusion of the citizenship question \u2013 \u201cSome offices received scripts that ask the citizenship question; this is not part of the decennial census and must be removed/crossed-out from all materials immediately\u201d \u2013 but Maria worried that some enumerators may have already received the scripts before the issue could be fixed.\nOn top of the already existing confusion and uncertainty around the homeless count, comes the coronavirus crisis \u2013 the shelter-in-place orders, and the warnings of social distancing.\nCensus workers at the local and national level are concerned about how the crisis will affect an already flawed operation.\n\u201cTrying to do a fixed point enumeration at a time of mass migration of where people live just seems insane, on top of what was already foundationally going to be a massive, massive challenge,\u201d Maria said.\nShe described the situation as frantic. \u201cThese are not the kind of operations where you can just wing it, and we have no guidance on how we plan on enumerating these people,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThe household stuff is going to be counted no matter what,\u201d Maria continued. \u201cBut even if we delay this two weeks, there\u2019s no way we\u2019re going to be able to get an accurate count of the people who are struggling on a lower rung.\u201d\nLocal census workers who planned to ignore the mismanagement on the federal level and help homeless people fill out the census on their own now find themselves increasingly hampered by safety concerns.\n\u201cI don\u2019t foresee this operation going well,\u201d said Clinton, the San Francisco census project manager. \u201cWe were relying on local providers, and I don\u2019t know if local providers will actually be able to help us out because of coronavirus.\u201d\nAt the height of event cancellations, Casey Farmer, the executive director of the Alameda county complete count committee, was with her staff at the winter shelter in Fremont, California, wrapping saran wrap around their iPads as one of their few defenses against the spread of coronavirus.\nThe shelter was set to close that weekend, and Farmer had asked the federal Census Bureau to send enumerators early, outside the planned days. They refused, so they sent instead. \u201cWe have to overcome these confines that the Census Bureau is upholding,\u201d she said.\nThough she recognizes the complications that the coronavirus crisis will add, Farmer hasn\u2019t given up.\n\u201cEveryone has a constitutional right to be counted,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to fight hard to make sure everyone is.\u201d",

Scott Murray talked us through Chelsea\u2019s 1970 FA Cup final replay win against Leeds on Saturday \u2013 here\u2019s the action from Old Trafford. Or to cut to the chase, it was all about the tasty, er, challenges. Next up, we revisited that Euro 96 semi-final \u2013 here are highlights of it not coming home. And if you really want to wallow in the mythology of that summer, here\u2019s the full ITV documentary looking back on it all.\n2) In a happy alternative universe, England\u2019s cricketers would be taking on Sri Lanka in the second Test this week in Colombo, which was the venue when England won the tightest and most combative series these sides have contested, in 2001, with Graham Thorpe steering England to a nervy four-wicket victory to wrap up the series 2-1. And here\u2019s the last time Moeen Ali looked truly on top of his game for England, skittling Sri Lanka in tandem with Jack Leach to seal a series whitewash in Colombo in 2018. And while we\u2019re on the subject of Sri Lanka, shall we have a bit of Murali?\n3) A young keeper keeps himself busy during self-isolation. And a less accomplished piece of amateur penalty-taking. At the same time, the pros are keeping themselves very busy. Manchester United\u2019s Angel Gomes goes for the bin, Trent Alexander-Arnold hits a garden ornament that looks like a cement mixer, James Milner has entertained the masses and Ben Chilwell is coming up with fun ways of making tea.\n4) This week marks four years since the death of Johan Cruyff. Not only was he a genius on the pitch but also a fine manager. Whether it is talking tactics, dribbling around opponents or banging in the goals, Cruyff was absolutely box office. Ultimately, he was an original artist on the football pitch, too.\n5) For those feeling a touch more energetic during these quiet times, you can always run a marathon on your balcony. There are still plenty of options, including kicking toilet rolls and parkour.\n6) The first virtual Formula One grand prix took place this week, due to the lack of actual racing. Lando Norris was involved, alongside Liam Payne and others of a similar ilk. Norris spent a lot of time on his phone to race support, which might explain why he did not win.\n1) Ian Wright\u2019s mouth-agape classic football shirts warehouse tour.\n2) Zambia\u2019s handball dreams for Tokyo 2020 (now put on hold)\n3) Footgolf at Tottenham.\n4) The history of the mile.\nSpotters\u2019 badge: whobroughtoranges\nGuardian YouTube football channel\nDo subscribe, if you fancy.\nDo subscribe, if you fancy.",

        "content": "Campaign ads continue to focus on the southern border even as pandemic has killed hundreds of Americans\nAs the reality of the coronavirus crisis took hold in the US, Donald Trump\u2019s Facebook campaign remained focused on a different \u201ccrisis\u201d \u2013 the supposed threat of immigrants entering the US through the southern border.\nTrump\u2019s re-election campaign has made no mention of the coronavirus pandemic in its Facebook ads to date, even as the outbreak has killed hundreds of Americans, infected tens of thousands and placed more than a third of the country\u2019s population under \u201cstay-at-home\u201d orders. Trump\u2019s campaign has spent about $1.34m on 18,982 ads that were shown to Facebook users at least 58m times since 1 March, a Guardian analysis of the Facebook political ad archive found.\nThe Trump campaign\u2019s silence on coronavirus on Facebook stands in contrast to Trump\u2019s real-life behavior. The president has been tweeting non-stop about the topic for weeks, and has recently taken to holding daily, marathon press briefings to discuss the pandemic and the administration\u2019s response.\nBuilding a wall on the US-Mexico border was the most common political issue mentioned in those ads, followed by attacks on Democratic party leaders and presidential candidates, as well as the news media.\n\u201cThey want open borders; they want crime,\u201d Trump says of Democrats in a video clip accompanying a typical immigration-themed ad. On 13 March \u2013 the same day that the global death toll passed 5,000 and Trump declared a national emergency \u2013 the campaign launched a tranche of advertisements declaring \u201cThe Do-Nothing Democrats\u2019 open border\u2019s agency is morally reprehensible\u201d and stating, \u201cI must put the safety of Americans above everything else\u201d.\nHowever, the majority ( 75%) of the 58m ad impressions received by Trump campaign ads since 1 March went to ads that made no mention of any political issue, beyond support for Trump. These include include an offer for a \u201c2020 Trump Gold Card Membership\u201d for a $35 campaign donation; contests to win a signed hat or meal with Melania Trump; and various Trump campaign products, such as \u201cOfficial Space Force\u201d merchandise, the \u201cOFFICIAL Trump Pence Keep America Great Dog Collar\u201d, St Patrick\u2019s Day-themed merchandise and plastic straws.\nThe campaign also ran ads designed to appeal to two constituency groups: African Americans and Indian Americans.\nA series of \u201cBlack Voices for Trump\u201d campaign ads began running on 11 March. The ads feature Diante Johnson, the founder and president of the Black Conservative Federation, David J Harris Jr, a black conservative author and podcaster, and Cecelia S Johnson delivering a generic fundraising pitch for Trump. The ads also encourage supporters to sign up for campaign text messages by texting \u2018WOKE\u2019 to the Trump campaign SMS number.\nThe ads appealing to Indian Americans began running in late February to coincide with Trump\u2019s visit to India. They feature photographs of the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, with messages such as:\n\u201cThank you for all your contributions to our culture and traditions that have made to the United States [sic]. Americans are eager to strengthen the ties between our two people. Our economy has never been better, and the United States is eager to build a strong partnership with India.\u201d\n\u201cIndian Americans are titans of business, masters of the arts, and innovate technology like few others. Your contributions have strengthened our culture and economy. I will always fight for YOU!\u201d\nThese advertisements do not ask for donations, but instead link to a dedicated page on Trump\u2019s campaign website entitled Namaste Trump. The campaign investment in both sets of constituency ads was relatively small, and they received less than 1% of the total impressions for all of Trump\u2019s campaign ads in March.\nThough Trump has ignored the coronavirus outbreak in his Facebook campaigning, the Trump campaign did send one SMS message about the pandemic to its supporters on 12 March. The text message included a link to a \u201cCoronavirus update from Team Trump\u201d which read in part: \u201cThe safety, security, and health of the American People is President Trump\u2019s top priority right now. With the help of the White House Task Force, the Trump Administration is leading an aggressive and comprehensive effort to stop the spread of the Coronavirus.\u201d\nThe message also encouraged recipients to visit the website coronavirus.gov, though the hyperlink was broken.",

        "content": "Only a fraction of applicants have been able to start claim online or get through to DWP on phone\nWorkers attempting to apply for universal credit after being laid off during the coronavirus crisis have described how it is almost impossible to complete a claim.\nMore than 500,000 people have applied for the vital payments in the last nine days, the Department for Work and Pensions revealed on Wednesday.\nHowever, benefits experts have warned that only a fraction of them will have succeeded because the service is swamped and it is currently almost impossible to talk to anyone at the DWP.\nFirst-time claimants have described calling the service between 80 and 100 times to no avail. The Guardian has been trying over the last two days, and has been unable to get through. At one stage yesterday there were queues of 145,000 people waiting to log on to the website, where all claims must start.\nAll those making a first application for universal credit would usually attend a meeting at their local job centre. However, since the Covid-19 crisis began, applicants have to call an 0800 number to make a phone appointment, but it is impossible, say applicants.\nClaimants already faced five-week waits for payments to be processed in normal times. The fear is that the system will be swamped unless the rules are changed. Many are also coming up against the problem that those with savings of more than \u00a316,000 are not entitled to universal credit.\nAnna Stevenson, a welfare and benefits expert at the financial charity Turn2Us, said claimants had been contacting the charity to report the problem, fearful that this will hold up the payments they are due.\nShe said the lack of call handlers is particularly affecting those applying for employment and support allowance, those with a disability or health condition, which rely on a phone call.\n\u201cUniversal credit claimants have to make this appointment within 30 days of them completing their applications, and for the claim to be approved, the interview must happen. People have been contacting is to us to ask what is going on as they are finding it impossible to get through,\u201d she said.\nThe DWP said on Thursday claimants could ask for an appointment by going back online and adding a note in their journal.\nOn Wednesday the DWP\u2019s top civil servant, Peter Schofield, told MPs that processing universal credit claims had become the department\u2019s main focus.\nHe said the department had so far redeployed 1,500 members of staff to help with universal credit claims, and the aim was to increase this to 3,900 by the end of the week.\nThe chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is due to give more details of support for the country\u2019s 5 million self-employed people later today, which may halt the rise in claims.\nThe work and pensions secretary, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, said: \u201cThe system is standing up to the challenge, but with a tenfold increase in claims it is inevitable that there are pressures on our services. We are taking urgent action to boost capacity, including moving 10,000 existing staff to work on new claims with 1,000 already in place, and will recruit a further 1,500 staff to aid the effort. I\u2019m hugely grateful to all our staff who are working extremely hard in difficult circumstances to process claims at pace.\u201d",

        "content": "The Saudi Arabian director directed her first film, Wadjda, hiding in the back of a van on the streets of Riyadh. Now her latest, The Perfect Candidate, is opening doors in Hollywood\nHaifaa Al-Mansour\u2019s latest film, The Perfect Candidate, opens with a doctor in her 20s driving to work. In any other film you wouldn\u2019t register the fact that she\u2019s behind the wheel. But this woman, dressed in a black abaya and niqab, is in Saudi Arabia, which until 2018 banned women from driving. Al-Mansour added the scene as a punch-the-air moment for female audiences in Saudi Arabia, an invite to a collective whoop of victory. \u201cI know that in the west this seems like common-sense stuff,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I think they\u2019ve really helped women to see themselves as an independent people.\u201d She fixes me with an earnest look, to see if I get it. \u201cFor younger professional women, it\u2019s huge, because it gives them control over their destiny.\u201d\nAl-Mansour is Saudi Arabia\u2019s first female director. In 2011, she shot her debut, Wadjda, hiding in the back of a van. It would have been impossible for a woman to be seen openly on the street giving orders to men. So, she kept out of sight and used a walkie-talkie (\u201cBut I\u2019m sure you could hear my voice all over Riyadh. \u2018Do that!\u2019 \u2018Pull the camera back!\u2019\u201d) The film was gorgeous, a funny, big-hearted story about a gobby 10-year-old girl who would stop at nothing to get her hands on a bike. Al-Mansour shrugged off the death threats (\u201cOne of them told me they had a coffin ready for me\u201d). Spend five minutes in her company and you are struck by her optimistic energy.\nThe new film is another inspiring story of female resistance, this time about a young female doctor who runs, almost by accident, for office in local elections. This time around, following the easing of restrictions segregating men and women, Al-Mansour could work in public. \u201cI wasn\u2019t in the van this time,\u201d she grins. \u201cI was shouting at all my crew in person!\u201d\nWe meet in London on International Women\u2019s Day, when social distancing is still a novelty. Walking into the cafe, 5ft-nothing in her Converse, she shakes my hand and then, mindful of the breach of etiquette, reaches into her handbag for a bottle of hand sanitiser and squirts me a dollop. The exchange smacks of her mix of warmth and no-nonsense.\nFour years ago, Al-Mansour moved from Bahrain to Los Angeles with her American husband Bradley Neimann, a diplomat, and their son, Adam, 12, and daughter, Hailey, 10. (\u201cThey are very American,\u201d she says of her kids. \u201cThey say \u2018dude\u2019 with an American accent.\u201d) But she missed home and so she wrote The Perfect Candidate, which stars the impossibly beautiful TV actor Mila Al Zahrani as Dr Maryam, a supremely capable young medic working in a rundown hospital (healthcare is a major employer of women). The film catches society in the midst of a transformation, at a moment when women have more freedom, but society is slow to embrace them. When Maryam holds an all-female fundraiser, the response is depressing: \u201cMy husband will kill me if I vote for you.\u201d \u201cI hope you win, but I don\u2019t vote.\u201d I\u2019m not giving anything away to say that Maryam has a tough time of it on the campaign trail \u2013 laughed at, patronised by a TV presenter, criticised as shrill and unfeminine.\nWas Al-Mansour making a more universal point? \u201cYeah, they are crushed. Look at Hillary Clinton. But seeing women in leadership positions is something people need to get used to.\u201d\nAt the start of the film Maryam wears the niqab; as she grows more confident in her identity it comes off. What did Al-Mansour want to say about the veil? \u201cAt the beginning Maryam wants to fit in. And what does society expect of women? To cover up. But at the end she understands what defiance means. It\u2019s about respect. A human being\u2019s identity is in their face. I think face covering is one of the most dangerous things that ever happened to the Muslim culture.\u201d For the first time in our conversation Al-Mansour is deadly serious. \u201cWe need female Muslim scholars who can deconstruct a lot of the literature about a woman\u2019s body and the veil. Like, for example, when I was a kid I was, I was told: \u2018You are like a cake. If you don\u2019t cover it, flies will come.\u2019 So it\u2019s blaming the victim. This is the psychology a lot of Muslim women go through \u2013 they have to cover because they\u2019re responsible for someone\u2019s else\u2019s actions.\u201d\nThe dress code for women has changed in Saudia Arabia, she adds. Women are encouraged not to be completely covered. \u201cBut a lot of women still cling to that because that is taught from the beginning that is what makes them good and chaste and noble.\u201d\nThe film, I think, has demythologising effect, too. It\u2019s a lesson to audiences in the west that behind the abayas and the veils, the women of the Middle East are modern citizens of the world. \u201cSaudi women are sassy and very resourceful,\u201d says Al-Mansour. \u201cYou try to buy a carpet from a Saudi woman; she will take all your money. They are very savvy. \u201d\nAl-Mansour gives the impression of being a natural-born rebel. She grew up in small conservative town, and describes herself as a shy kid, the eighth of 12 children in a liberal house. Her father was a poet. Where does the rebellious streak come from? \u201cMy parents,\u201d she answers quickly. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have money, but I feel really privileged. I was respected. My father and my mother never told me: \u2018Because you are a woman you can\u2019t do this.\u2019\u201d Music filled the house, and as teenager she watched Jackie Chan and Bollywood movies. \u201cWhenever I told people at school I listened to music, they\u2019d be like: \u2018You\u2019re going straight to hell. I don\u2019t want to play with you.\u2019 So, I felt like an outsider.\u201d\nAfter studying literature at the American University in Cairo, she got a marketing job at a Saudi oil company. \u201cIn meetings they would never listen to me. I was invisible.\u201d Al-Mansour began her career in film by making a short films with her siblings. In 2005, she met Neimann at a screening of one of her documentaries at the US embassy in Saudi Arabia where he was working as a cultural attache. When he was posted to Australia, she studied film in Sydney and wrote the script that became Wadjda.\nRight now, Al-Mansour\u2019s plan is to make films in Saudi Arabia and the west. She arrived in Hollywood at the right time, she tells me. \u201cI get a lot of chances. I get a lot of meetings. I have a chance now to build a resum\u00e9 that allows me, hopefully, in a couple of years to direct a really big movie with a big budget.\u201d Would she be up for making a blockbuster? She raises an eyebrow, surprised I would even ask the question. \u201cYes! I think I can make an amazing $100m film. Ten years ago, that would be unheard of, for a film-maker like me who\u2019s not white and who\u2019s not American, who\u2019s not a man.\u201d\n#MeToo and #OscarSoWhite have made real and meaningful differences for women such as Al-Mansour. \u201cWhat happened with Harvey Weinstein was a wake-up call. All the misogyny that we took for granted is not acceptable any more. There is the intention for improvement and it\u2019s up to us women film-makers to take opportunities and run with them and work really hard and show the world what we\u2019ve got.\u201d\n The Perfect Candidate is released in the UK on digital download (Curzon Home Entertainment, BFI Player, Modern Films) on 27 March",

        "content": "Versatile stage, TV and film actor who featured in sci-fi series and became a mainstay of the Royal Shakespeare Company\nAfter a spectacular start to his television career in the 1960s, when he played leading roles in two classics by Dostoevsky, the actor David Collings, who has died aged 79, became a cult favourite of sci-fi fans with weird appearances in UFO (produced by the Thunderbirds team of Gerry and Sylvia Anderson), three Doctor Who sagas and the 1979 supernatural detective series Sapphire and Steel, co-starring Joanna Lumley and David McCallum.\nAlthough he started out on the stage, Collings did not consolidate his reputation there until completing more than a decade of television stardom, after which he was in a string of important roles for the Royal Shakespeare Company.\nAt the Open Air theatre in Regent\u2019s Park he was a genuinely funny Polonius opposite newcomer Damian Lewis\u2019s firebrand Hamlet in 1994, directed by Tim Pigott-Smith; he had first played a tetchy but benignly well-meaning Polonius for an RSC touring production with Philip Franks in 1987.\nCollings was a fine featured, red-haired actor with sensitive blue eyes who was equally good at playing neurotic and sweet-natured characters. On television he also ran a good line in eminent characters from history: Percy Grainger in Ken Russell\u2019s Song of Summer (1968), Sir Anthony Babington in Elizabeth R (1971), John Ruskin in The Love School (1975), William Wilberforce in The Fight Against Slavery (1975) and William Pitt in Prince Regent (1979).\nHe was born in Brighton, East Sussex, to George Collings, a greengrocer, and his wife, Lillian (nee Parsons). At Varndean grammar school he enjoyed acting but had no thoughts of setting out to be a professional actor and, on leaving, started work as a designer in lettering, inheriting that interest from his father, a keen artist. From 1960 he was happily involved in amateur dramatics for the Withdean Players and the Lewes Little theatre, but then was recommended by the actor Freda Dowie to the director David Scase, who had been appointed to run the Liverpool Rep.\nAfter six months in rep, Collings found himself pitched into television through another unsolicited recommendation, this time from the actor John Slater, who thought he might be suitable casting in a 1964 Play of the Week presentation of Crime and Punishment. Thus he found himself playing the impoverished tragic hero, Raskolnikov, murderer of an old pawnbroker, in a three-and-a-half hour existential epic alongside Steven Berkoff, Peter Bowles, Julia Foster and Sylvia Coleridge.\nFive years later, in 1969, he was in another mighty Dostoevsky production, a BBC version in six episodes of The Possessed, as the charismatic rabble-rouser Pyotr Verkhovensky, alongside Rosalie Crutchley, Joan Hickson and Angela Pleasence. In the same year he was the Clerk in a BBC adaptation in seven long episodes of Chaucer\u2019s Canterbury Tales, with Barbara Jefford as the Wife of Bath and Barry Linehan as the Miller.\nHe made a rare feature movie appearance as a lovable Bob Cratchit in the musical Scrooge (1970), with Albert Finney, in the same year as he was captured by aliens and imbued with superhuman powers in UFO. In Doctor Who he was an alien himself, in a rubber mask, with ideas of blowing up the Cybermen with a home-made rocket in 1975; a robot-phobic, Poul, in a 1977 narrative that found him crawling round the floor and sobbing; and in 1983, Peter Davison having succeeded Tom Baker in the title role, he was mistaken for the good doctor before mutating into a mutant with a wild spaghetti hairstyle.\nPausing only to play Legolas in Lord of the Rings on BBC Radio 4 in 1981, and a guest appearance in the final wipe-out episode of Blake\u2019s 7, Collings joined the RSC for the first time as Newman Noggs in the 1985 revival of David Edgar\u2019s Nicholas Nickleby on tour and on Broadway. He also appeared in a star-studded chorus in the fine Don Taylor television script of Sophocles\u2019 Oedipus (1986), with Michael Pennington, Claire Bloom and John Gielgud.\nFor the RSC subsequently, between 1996 and 2001, he played Thomas Cranmer in Henry VIII, Baron de Charlus in Tennessee Williams\u2019s Camino Real, Count Lerma in Schiller\u2019s Don Carlos, Sir Politic Would-Be in Ben Jonson\u2019s Volpone, Cardinal Pandulph in King John and Sancho in Lope de Vega\u2019s Madness in Valencia. You could not devise a more varied roster of roles, but he discharged them all with a bitter charm and watchful, wary eye.\nIn this millennium, he played a neat double of Sir Henry Green and the Duke of Surrey in Kevin Spacey\u2019s Richard II (2005), directed by Trevor Nunn at the Old Vic, and graced a startling revival of Middleton and Rowley\u2019s Jacobean shocker The Changeling (2006) for Declan Donnellan\u2019s Cheek by Jowl company at the Barbican; the cast also included Will Keen, Olivia Williams and an unknown but tremendous Tom Hiddleston.\nA favourite \u201cjob\u201d was appearing with his son, Samuel, in Toby Frow\u2019s 1950s revival of Marlowe\u2019s Edward II at the Royal Exchange, Manchester, in 2011; he was old Mortimer and Matrevis while Sam doubled as the king\u2019s lover, Piers Gaveston, and his poker-wielding murderer, Lightborn.\nCollings was married firstly to Deirdre Bromfield, whom he met at the Lewes Little theatre, in 1962 (they divorced in 1975), and secondly to the actor Karen Archer in 1983, from whom he was separated, although they remained close friends. He is survived by Karen, by their children, Samuel and Eliza, his daughter, Kate, from his first marriage, and his sister, Nola. He was predeceased by Deirdre and two of their children, Matthew and Bethian.\n David Cressy Collings, actor, born 4 June 1940; died 23 March 2020",

        "content": "Wigan won the final but all of rugby won the day in an unforgettable match featuring two legendary Kangaroos\nBack when the earth was young the rugby league season would be played out on an assortment of northern mud heaps in winter before the Challenge Cup final brought a ceremonial climax in early May. The sun always seemed to shine at Wembley, the two finalists generally rose to the challenge of presenting the game in its best light given space and a billiard table surface, and the happy memories would last all summer until it was time to visit places such as Odsal and Wilderspool again.\nThe 1985 final between Hull and Wigan certainly delivered on happy memories. Frank Keating on these very pages described it as the most voluptuous exhibition of running rugby he had ever witnessed. Note: not rugby league. He just said rugby. It was the 50th final staged at Wembley, and a procession on the pitch before kick-off featured players or representatives from each winning side down the years. All the old-timers agreed afterwards that the final was one of the most exciting and memorable contests the sport had produced.\nWigan won, though another five minutes and Hull\u2019s magnificent fightback might have secured victory. The peerless Wigan stand-off Brett Kenny was a deserving Lance Todd trophy winner as man of the match \u2013 though, had the votes been counted at the end of the game rather than 15 minutes before its conclusion, his equally deserving Parramatta and Australia teammate Peter Sterling would have been in with a shout.\nSterling led the Hull comeback, Kenny was the inspiration behind most of the spectacular tries that propelled Wigan towards taking a seemingly commanding 28-12 lead. The pair had made their names in this country three years earlier as half-back partners for the invincible Kangaroo tourists, now they had been eagerly snapped up on short contracts by adventurous English clubs keen to import their dazzling brand of youth and vigour.\nIt could be argued the 1985 final was merely the first to be thus enlivened after the relaxing of an international transfer ban a couple of years earlier, though few occasions in the era of free movement since have managed to be as colourful or pulsating. Nor was the Kenny-Sterling rivalry the only thing to admire.\nOn one Wigan wing was the incredible John Ferguson, a hitherto unknown Indigenous Australian whose prodigious talent was only recognised by international selectors in his homeland after the two typically improbable tries he scored at Wembley. On the other was Henderson Gill, a muscular and elusive runner from Huddersfield who had endured a miserable time in the final defeat by Widnes the previous year.\nFor this was not the Wigan who would sweep all before them a few years later, winning the Challenge Cup eight years on the trot. Far from it, at this point in their history Wigan had not won at Wembley since 1965, when Billy Boston and Brian McTigue were still playing. Hull, with a young Garry Schofield and Lee Crooks in their side, were considered narrow favourites beforehand, although keeping Schofield under wraps until the second half was probably a mistake.\nGill scored arguably the try of the afternoon, hurtling half the length of the left touchline before lighting up the stadium with a radiant grin, though Kenny\u2019s exquisitely controlled glide for his first-half score was just as stunning. The goal-kicking was poor throughout, indeed some Hull supporters still claim the final was lost for want of a specialist kicker, though it is also true that Wigan forced Hull out wide for their tries and were never opened up through the middle as was the case when Shaun Edwards scored.\nWhile neither he nor his teammate Mike Ford would have had any inkling that their futures lay in rugby union, the most decorated player in rugby league history will always have a soft spot for 1985. Of the record 37 medals Edwards amassed, this was the first.",

They are saying it\u2019s the number arriving and the speed with which they are arriving and how ill they are. They talk about wave after wave after wave. The words that are used to me are that it\u2019s a continuous tsunami. As one said to me, it\u2019s much bigger and large numbers with a greater degree of stretch than you can ever have possibly imagined.\n\u201cThe CEOs are concerned that all that extra capacity is now being used up very, very quickly. We\u2019ve got the surge capacity at the ExCel centre but this is filling up very quickly.\u201d\nHe said this was forming a \u201cwicked combination\u201d with the problem of up to 50% staff sickness rates in some trusts, which is \u201can unprecedented absence rate\u201d.\nEarlier, he tweeted that the surge in demand for coronavirus treatment was \u201coff the scale\u201d in London already and it was \u201cevident that a number of hospitals are on a trajectory where their critical care capacity will become full within a few days\u201d.\nHe added: \u201cLondon CEOs saying they urgently want a lot more of everything \u2013 staff, ventilators, critical care capacity, PPE, testing capacity \u2013 but they recognise that their job is to do absolutely the best with what they have got and that\u2019s what they are focused on.\u201d\nOn Tuesday, a study by doctors warned that hospitals in England will run short of critical care beds for Covid-19 patients within the next two weeks if the numbers becoming severely ill reach those experienced in Italy.\nA paper by a team at the University of Cambridge said that five of the seven NHS commissioning regions will have more patients needing critical care than the number of beds normally available in hospital intensive care units (ICUs) within a fortnight.\nBut Prof Neil Ferguson of Imperial College, who is advising the government, struck a more optimistic note on Thursday as he predicted the NHS will manage to get through the crisis without being totally overwhelmed.\n\u201cWe are going to have a very difficult few weeks by we think overall with the capacity being rapidly put in place that whilst the health system will be stressed it won\u2019t break,\u201d he told the same programme.\nJonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, said Labour was concerned that doctors and nurses were short of protective equipment, with some sourcing goggles and masks from DIY stores.\nIn a round of broadcast interviews, Edward Argar, the health minister, defended the government\u2019s ability to protect NHS staff, insisting that \u201cmasses of supplies\u201d were being distributed by the army around the clock.\nHe also said testing for NHS staff was coming on stream in the weeks to come, following criticism that the government has been slow to ramp it up from around 6,000 a day up to a target of 25,000.",

        "content": "Care home bosses angry they are not being given same priority as NHS workers\nCare homes are struggling to buy food and are being prevented from purchasing in bulk by supermarkets which are not giving them the same priority as NHS workers, some have warned.\nThe National Care Association, which represents more than 600 small and medium-sized care homes, said some members have been unable to stock up adequately. One operator told the Guardian the latest order from their wholesaler was delivered on Wednesday with half of the items missing.\n\u201cWe have stories of people being turned away from supermarkets because they are not considered key workers,\u201d said Nadra Ahmed, the executive chairman of the industry body. Providers said choice has been cut back and residents were not getting food they necessarily liked.\nThe issue is part of a list of problems that care homes are facing as they brace for outbreaks of the virus, and increased demand to look after chronically ill people, to free up capacity in the NHS. Leaders are concerned about a lack of personal protective equipment, the need to train staff in \u201cbarrier nursing\u201d, which increases hygiene levels, a lack of testing and staff shortages.\nAhmed said that in a small minority of cases, operators were warning they might not be able to continue to operate because of staff self-isolating and going off sick.\n\u201cPeople are making the choice not to work in this setting,\u201d Ahmed said. \u201cMembers are starting to say they may not be able to continue to operate as a care home, because we don\u2019t have the staff.\u201d\nShe said she was contacted on Wednesday by a provider with two homes who said they were unsure how much longer they were going to be able to continue.\nSmall and medium-sized care homes often rely on supermarket deliveries and have not been granted any priority over members of the public or the right to buy in bulk.\n\u201cIt has been a nightmare,\u201d said Robin Hall, who runs the Home of Comfort nursing home in Hampshire. She said it was no longer possible to buy from their usual supplier, Asda, and that wholesale deliveries were very limited.\n\u201cIn our previous order two-thirds of the items were missing and today half were missing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt has meant some residents have not been able to have the food they like and we can\u2019t offer as much choice.\u201d\n\u201cWe can\u2019t get a Tesco delivery for love nor money,\u201d said Andrea Pattison, owner of the St Ronans Care Home in Southsea. \u201cBefore this becomes a problem, we need to think about how we are going to secure this. If the NHS food supplies are being secured, can\u2019t they do the same for social care?\u201d\nPattison added: \u201c[At one supermarket] I went to speak to customer services, said I was from a care home and asked if they had antibacterial wipes, would they allow me to buy more? They said no.\u201d\nSome managers voice hopes that supply chains for food and protective equipment will improve. The NHS is providing care homes with boxes of 300 face masks from its pandemic stock, but buying plastic aprons and antibacterial gels remains difficult.\nSimon Whalley, the chairman of Birtley House Group, which operates in Surrey, said he was receiving a very large number of job applications from people whose employers have had to shut down, notably with catering, reception or housekeeping skills. He said the lack of testing of staff and patients for the presence of the coronavirus was a key issue.\nSymptoms are defined by the NHS as either:\nNHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should\u00a0stay at home for at least 7 days.\nIf you live with other people,\u00a0they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.\nAfter 14 days, anyone you live with who does not have symptoms can return to their normal routine. But, if anyone in your home gets symptoms, they should stay at home for 7 days from the day their symptoms start.\u00a0Even if it means they're at home for longer than 14 days.\nIf you live with someone who is 70 or over, has a long-term condition, is pregnant or has a weakened immune system, try to find somewhere else for them to stay for 14 days.\nIf you have to stay at home together, try to keep away from each other as much as possible.\nAfter 7 days, if you no longer have a high temperature you can return to your normal routine.\nIf you still have a high temperature, stay at home until your temperature returns to normal.\nIf you still have a cough after 7 days, but your temperature is normal, you do not need to continue staying at home. A cough can last for several weeks after the infection has gone.\nStaying at home means you should:\nYou can use your garden, if you have one. You can also leave the house to exercise \u2013 but stay at least 2 metres away from other people.\nIf you have symptoms of coronavirus, use the\u00a0NHS 111 coronavirus service\u00a0to find out what to do.\nSource:\u00a0NHS England\u00a0on 23 March 2020\n\u201cWe have some 15% of our staff isolating because they or their family have shown some symptoms but these could be unrelated [to coronavirus],\u201d he said. \u201cWe are unable to test residents who may develop symptoms either nor can we test potential new residents.\u201d\nJulie Nicholls, the manager of the Appleby Lodge care home in Cornwall, said she was \u201cfurious\u201d that care home workers were not recognised as frontline workers.\n\u201cCare homes have received no guidance from the government,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve instituted the safest practices we can but we\u2019re not experts in the virus. We should be getting advice from the experts.\u201d\n\u201cCare workers are playing an absolutely vital role in keeping vulnerable people safe, and they will also form a vital role so the NHS can discharge people and get beds open for others,\u201d said Pattison. \u201cThey need to be recognised in the way NHS staff rightly are being.\u201d",

That\u2019s why cinemas were among the first businesses to be hit by the pandemic. And it could be a while before any of us are able to watch anything on the big screen.\nThe Guardian\u2019s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.\u00a0Learn more.\nHollywood is putting on a brave face for the time being. Only one movie, Trolls World Tour, has so far been shifted from theatrical release to streaming platforms, though films such as Disney\u2019s Onward and Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, Universal\u2019s The Invisible Man, Warner Bros\u2019 The Way Back and Lionsgate\u2019s I Still Believe have all made their way to the small screen far more rapidly than would have been expected prior to the outbreak.\nThe president of the US-based National Association of Theater Owners, John Fithian, indicated this week that multiplex owners were keen for Trolls World Tour to be an \u201coutlier\u201d rather than an indicator of the new Hollywood normal. But Warner Bros recently denied reports that superhero movie Wonder Woman 1984 might go straight to streaming platforms. The fact is that studios are unlikely to continue honouring the longstanding theatrical \u201cwindow\u201d , which ensures cinemas get movies for a significant period before they are allowed to debut in the home, when multiplexes are unable to open.\nMovies, unlike live gigs or going to see a DJ spin in a nightclub, can be consumed at home with the minimum of disruption to the experience. It\u2019s not only possible to monetise content streaming, but audiences are already used to paying for movies online. It is therefore inevitable, should the pandemic last for more than a couple of months, that more and more releases will make the leap straight to the small screen.\nMight there be a silver lining here for those of us waiting with bated breath for the next big sci-fi, fantasy or comic-book movie? For a while, it\u2019s been clear that Hollywood has reached such a level of technical excellence that audiences viewing big-budget movies in the cinema are no longer bothered if the film makes no logical sense, has terrible dialogue and features clunky acting. How else to explain the runaway success of Michael Bay\u2019s Transformers films or DC superhero flicks such as Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice?\nLet\u2019s imagine for a moment what Hollywood might look like in a world without cinemas. We would lose moments such as those glorious watery fight scenes in Blade Runner 2049, the outrageous pulsing of Hans Zimmer\u2019s gorgeously bruising score pummelling the eardrums into ecstasy while Roger Deakins\u2019 epic cinematography sets synapses on fire and almost causes our eyes to pop clean out of our skulls with its sheer high-definition intensity. Denis Villeneuve\u2019s film is a perfectly enjoyable watch on the small screen, but at a high-spec cinema it\u2019s a religious experience. Likewise, James Cameron\u2019s Avatar has its detractors, but few can forget the first time they saw it in blistering 3D on the big screen.\nOn the other hand, might the shift to streaming lead to some interesting changes in the way film-makers approach their art? Imagine if the creative team behind The Mandalorian had been in charge of making the latest Star Wars film, Rise of Skywalker, and had been given the time and patience to deliver a fitting finale to the long-running space opera, rather than a botched, overly self-referential rush job with zero new ideas.\nIs it too much to hope for that we might see a gentle transition towards a cinema of ideas over spectacle. It\u2019s been palpable in recent times how well cerebral science fiction works on the small screen, from shows such as Westworld and Black Mirror to straight-to-streaming films such as I Am Mother. While both feature their fair share of action thrills and spills, these are predominantly dialogue-based concoctions that are perfectly enjoyable on a laptop. When similar ideas end up being translated for the multiplex, the result is often far lazier, as if the focus is on making those high-octane set pieces really pop at the expense of storytelling. The best we can hope for is a half-decent Terminator movie every few years.\nPerhaps in years to come, we\u2019ll see this period as a turning point for big-budget cinema, when the closure of multiplexes for long periods encouraged film-makers to try a different route to getting their ideas in front of an audience. When, forced to turn down cinema\u2019s volume, Hollywood finally realised it needed to turn up the imagination.",

Plus: UN warns pandemic could cause global food shortage\nGood morning, I\u2019m Molly Blackall with today\u2019s essential stories.\nThe US Senate voted 96-0 to pass the $2.2tn emergency relief package agreed on Wednesday by the White House and Senate leaders. It came after a last-minute amendment from Republican senators, who argued that the bill would encourage workers to take unemployment payments over a job, which failed. The bill includes funds for hospitals, the unemployed, businesses, and direct payments to American families, and offers a combination of grants and loans.\nMeanwhile, Donald Trump launched his latest tirade against the media, accusing them of wanting to keep the US shut during the coronavirus outbreak in order to reduce his chance of re-election. He lashed out at suggestions that his intention to open the economy by Easter was politically motivated, while public health experts warned of the risks of reopening the economy prematurely.\nChristian leaders joined Democratic frontrunner Joe Biden and a number of state officials in criticising the president\u2019s Easter timeline.\nDeaths in the US exceed 1,000. The number of confirmed cases of coronavirus has risen to 69,197, with 1,046 deaths and 619 recoveries.\nFrontline medical workers in New York are preparing for an upsurge in the number of coronavirus patients, with hospitals attempting to rapidly expand their intensive care units and directing patients with cuts and breaks to private practices. New York authorities are also seeking to open up makeshift hospitals in hotels and dormitories, while governor Andrew Cuomo has called on retired healthcare workers to volunteer.\nIn better news, Cuomo also said that early signs show that social distancing may be working. According to the governor, the number of hospitalisations were projected to double every 4.7 days on Tuesday, instead of the 3.4-day projection given on Monday. About 56% of all the cases in the US, and 60% of new cases, were in the New York metro area, according to Dr Deborah Birx, part of the White House taskforce.\nYour questions answered\nMen are much more likely to test positive and to die from coronavirus, in a trend replicated across the world. We ask the experts why.\nHow long does coronavirus survive on different surfaces? Experts respond to common questions on the spread of the disease\nProtectionist policies by national governments during the coronavirus pandemic could cause food shortages across the world within weeks, the chief economist at the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation told the Guardian. The crisis has caused a shortage of field workers and a shift to protectionist measures including export bans and tariffs, but the economist warned that restricting the flow of food was the \u201cworst that can happen\u201d.\nJapan. Residents in Tokyo have been told to stay at home \u201cat all costs\u201d to avoid an \u201cexplosion\u201d of coronavirus cases. While Tokyo does not yet have the restrictions seen in countries like the UK, the city\u2019s governor, Yuriko Koike, described the situation as \u201csevere\u201d, and a panel of experts said on Thursday that Covid-19 infections could be \u201crampant\u201d across the country.\nWorld Cup. Migrant labourers building infrastructure for the 2022 World Cup are still being sent to work in Qatar despite a ban on all forms of gathering during the coronavirus outbreak. Workers told the Guardian it was \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d, with long shifts and few health checks.\nA federal court rejected permits to build the Dakota access pipeline yesterday, following an environmental review. The ruling marks an enormous victory for the Standing Rock Sioux tribe in North Dakota, which had sued the US government to prevent the pipeline being built on tribal lands, in a project deemed to be environmentally damaging.\nThe man charged with murdering 51 people at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, has made a sudden change to his plea to admit all charges. The defendant had maintained a not-guilty plea throughout, but since his admission his trial has been called off and he has been convicted of all charges, much to the relief and shock of those injured or bereaved. The attacks, which were live-streamed online last year, are considered to be the worst massacre in the country\u2019s modern history, injuring a further 40 people.\nA former FBI agent who disappeared in Iran in 2007 died in Iranian custody, his family have said. The US originally claimed Robert Levinson had visited the country on his own initiative, but it was later revealed he had been sent by CIA analysts who lacked the authority to run operations. The family said they had been told by US officials, but did not know the details of his death, only that Levinson died prior to the coronavirus outbreak.\nGlobal efforts to help reverse damage to the ozone layer appear to be working. The southern jet stream is beginning to return to a normal state after decades of disruption from human activity, a study has shown. According to scientists, the study shows it is possible to heal aspects of the climate if governments act together, and act fast.\nYour place or mine?\nCouples who\u2019ve had to decide whether to move in together or stay apart talk about life in quarantine, with or without their significant other. Meanwhile, Jack Shenker explores the impact of the pandemic on cities and housing, from densification to globalisation, and what this might mean for our urban spaces after the outbreak.\nAmy Poehler: How would Knope cope?\nThe Parks and Recreation star talks about the continuing relevance of the workplace comedy and how her character Leslie Knope would manage during the coronavirus pandemic. Plus, the creation of Galentines Day, and her new project with the writers behind The Simpsons.\nTrump vs other world leaders: social distancing\nPhotographs of world leaders practising social distancing, compared with the most recent photographs of Donald Trump, show a notable difference in their approaches to coronavirus. If you\u2019re taking social distancing more seriously than the president, Jack Schofield takes you through the best tablets for elderly relatives who might be less computer-literate.\nCovid-19\u2019s economic victims\nWhile coronavirus is yet to take a hold on Kansas City, the economic impact of the pandemic has hit residents in its poorest neighbourhoods hard. Many have lost their jobs, and are now running out of food. Chris McGreal meets the economic victims of coronavirus. Plus, small businesses warn they may not survive the pandemic.\nThe purported decision between the economy and public health has troubling intellectual roots, writes Siva Vaidhyanathan, arguing that we shouldn\u2019t buy into the narrative of economy before all else.\nEconomism is a belief system that leads people to believe that everything can be simplified to models and curves, and that it\u2019s possible to count and maximize utility in every circumstance. What economism misses includes complexity, historical contingency, and the profound, uncountable power of human emotion.\nThe US morning briefing is delivered to thousands of inboxes every weekday.

The Egyptian government\u2019s official count at the time period covered by the data was that three people were infected.\nThe day after the story was published, Michaelson was called to a three-and-a-half hour meeting with officials including the chairman of the state information service (SIS), Diaa Rashwan, where she says she and another journalist who had tweeted about the research were accused of misreporting an unreliable study and spreading panic.\nThe Egyptian officials demanded the story be retracted or that the Guardian publish an official apology.\nOn 17 March, Michaelson\u2019s press accreditation was revoked. The Guardian offered the Egyptian authorities the chance to write a letter for publication rebutting its report or the Canadian study, but received no response to the offer.\nThe following day, British diplomatic officials and the SIS passed on the message to Michaelson that she needed to meet Egypt\u2019s visa issuance authority.\nMichaelson, who is also a German citizen, said she was advised by German diplomatic officials in Cairo that she should not attend the meeting under any circumstances. \u201cThey said, \u2018We do not believe it\u2019s safe for you to go to this meeting. You\u2019re at high risk of arrest and you should get on a plane,\u2019\u201d she said.\nFlights out of Egypt were due to be suspended at noon the following day, Thursday, and with so many foreign tourists trying to flee the country as travel bans kicked in around the world, most planes were fully booked.\nMichaelson said she was advised by the British embassy and her own contacts that members of the country\u2019s security apparatus were seeking to immediately remove her from the country. \u201cThe national security agency told British diplomats that there was a plane one evening and they \u2018wanted me on it\u2019,\u201d she said.\nA lawyer who attended the meeting with the visa issuance authority on Michaelson\u2019s behalf was given the same message, she added.\nShe left Egypt on a flight ferrying stranded tourists and foreign nationals to Germany on Friday evening.\nMichaelson\u2019s departure leaves the north African country with no full-time British newspaper correspondents. Bel Trew, a correspondent for the Times, was threatened with a military trial and expelled from Egypt in March 2018.\n\u201cThe Guardian is a global news organisation that strives to report with clarity and integrity at all times,\u201d a spokesperson for the Guardian said. \u201cIn this instance we reported on scientific findings by credible infectious disease experts. We have offered the Egyptian government opportunity to comment and respond to our reporting in the normal way.\n\u201cWe regret that the Egyptian authorities have chosen to revoke accreditation from a reporter working for a trusted, independent media organisation like the Guardian.\u201d\nA spokesperson for the Foreign Office said: \u201cThe UK supports media freedom around the world. We have urged Egypt to guarantee freedom of expression. UK ministers have raised this case with the Egyptian authorities.\u201d\nAsked for comment, an Egyptian official directed the Guardian to a letter sent last week by the SIS to the newspaper\u2019s editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner. It argued the University of Toronto research cited in Michaelson\u2019s story relied on speculation, and that its approach and results had been rejected by the World Health Organization (WHO).\nIn fact, the WHO said it was unable to verify the methodology used in the study, and said its own data was drawn from hospitals, meaning there was often a reporting delay. \u201cIt is possible that there are many other cases with mild symptoms which did not result in hospital visits, and therefore are not detected or reported,\u201d a WHO official told reporters in Cairo.\nEgypt had 366 confirmed cases of the virus by Monday with 19 deaths, according to the country\u2019s health ministry.\nPress freedom in Egypt has severely deteriorated since the military took power in 2013 and the former commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, became president the following year.\nThe Committee to Protect Journalists said in its annual report last year that 26 reporters were detained in the country and that most had been prosecuted in groups on charges of terrorism and reporting false news.\nDomestic media has gradually come to be dominated by the state, which exercises widespread censorship. The office of the country\u2019s last major independent news outlet, Mada Masr, was raided late last year. Access to its website from inside Egypt has been blocked.",

They will then be available on demand for seven days.\nLisa Burger, the executive director and joint chief executive of the National Theatre, said writers, actors and directors had all waived their rights to the productions.\n\u201cEveryone has said yes. Please. Let\u2019s get it out to people,\u201d she said. \u201cIt has taken a bit of negotiation and management but the outpouring from the industry has been fantastic.\u201d\nThe shows will be available to watch on YouTube. They kick off on 2 April with a play regarded as one of the most joyously laugh-out-loud shows of the last decade.\nOne Man, Two Guvnors, directed by Nicholas Hytner, is Bean\u2019s 2011 adaptation of Carlo Goldoni\u2019s 1746 comedy and a brilliant vehicle for Corden\u2019s stage comedy skills. The Guardian\u2019s Michael Billington, giving it five stars, wrote: \u201cThe result, a kind of Carry On Carlo, is one of the funniest productions in the National\u2019s history.\u201d\nThat will be followed by Sally Cookson\u2019s adaptation of Charlotte Bront\u00eb\u2019s Jane Eyre, a production that began at Bristol Old Vic; Bryony Lavery\u2019s adaptation of Treasure Island which was the National\u2019s Christmas show in 2014, and the 2017 Twelfth Night, which starred Tamsin Greig as Malvolio. More titles are still to be announced.\nThe shows will also have accompanying contact, which includes Q&As with casts and creatives and post-show talks.\nThe National is just one of many arts organisations quickly endeavouring to get content out to the public during the coronavirus lockdown.\nThe RSC has teamed up with the BBC for six plays to be broadcast from their archives including the 2016 Hamlet starring Paapa Essiedu; the 2018 Macbeth that starred Christopher Eccleston and Niamh Cusack, and the 2015 Othello, which starred Hugh Quarshie and Lucian Msamati.\nThe Royal Opera House has made available productions that include the Royal Opera\u2019s Cos\u00ec fan tutte and the Royal Ballet\u2019s Peter and the Wolf.\nBurger said storytelling was needed more than ever. \u201cThat combination of entertaining, inspiring, challenging \u2026 it makes us think a bit about what other people might be going through. But also it just brings people together around something which is shared. I hope it stimulates a lot of conversations.\u201d\nAs well as National Theatre at Home, the theatre is making its online resource for schools, universities and libraries, the National Theatre Collection, accessible at home while everything is closed.\nThe National Theatre will be one of many arts organisations and individuals to benefit from Arts Council England\u2019s \u00a3160m emergency package to help them survive the coronavirus crisis. The money is also designed to help them come up with creative responses \u201cto buoy the public\u201d during the lockdown\nBurger said it was a positive move. \u201cOf course it is very much needed because we are all in a very precarious position. It is good that they have got that money and we look forward to understanding how it will be used, how freelancers can be supported and also theatres who don\u2019t receive Arts Council funding.\u201d",

We are hearing of people going hungry.\n\u201cCare workers are terrified. There is pressure from every possible angle. People are scared and are being put in the position of having to decide whether they go to work thinking they may have the virus, otherwise their children will go hungry. They are in an impossible situation.\u201d\nThe charity announced on Thursday it is launching a \u00a31m emergency appeal to support care workers during the coronavirus crisis. It aims to raise enough to give \u00a3500 grants to 2,000 individuals.\nFrom next week, care staff, personal assistants and support workers will be able to apply to the charity for grants if they are unable to work because they are self-isolating.\nA number of care workers have gone into self-isolation for 12 weeks because of underlying health conditions, said Gerlich.\nShe said she hoped the appeal would highlight the role care staff were playing to support vulnerable people during the outbreak.\n\u201cThe NHS keeps getting talked about,\u201d she said, \u201cbut social care is doing the same for longer hours with more risk. Social care workers are sacrificing their health to support people. The least we can do is ensure they are not going into debt.\u201d\nGerlich said some care staff had not had their children accepted in school sessions for key workers\u2019 children, and so were having to find and pay for extra childcare. Others have been refused access to key worker shopping sessions in supermarkets.\nAs well as appealing for donations from the public, the charity is asking companies to contribute and has suggested that chief executives could give a proportion of their salaries for the next three months.\nThe appeal was launched as the GMB union warned the coronavirus crisis could lead to the total collapse of the care system. It said care staff were being left with no protection against the virus, no childcare and poverty sick pay if they become infected.\nKelly Andrews, the union\u2019s care lead, said: \u201cDespite being on the frontline, and utterly vital to stop our society from crumbling, they are on minimum wage, with unpaid breaks and are unable to rely on schools for childcare.\n\u201cAnd to rub salt in the wound, if they become ill they either have to try and support their families on poverty sick pay \u2013 or turn up to work ill which could be a death sentence for residents.\u201d\nThe GMB is calling for all care staff to receive full pay during the outbreak.\nDonations to the appeal can be made via the Care Workers\u2019 Charity\u2019s website or a JustGiving page.",

        "content": "The actor was one of the first celebrities to contract coronavirus. To celebrate his recovery, we round up his finest performances\nYikes. This was one of the Hankster\u2019s two directorial credits and it is a dull and lifeless autumn-years romcom, with Hanks playing opposite Julia Roberts, who is every bit as uneasy as the man himself.\nHanks has a cameo as a dead Elvis Presley impersonator here; ironic, as he got Covid-19 while on location in Australia filming Baz Luhmann\u2019s Elvis biopic, in which he was due to play Presley\u2019s manager, Colonel Tom Parker.\nHanks is the dashing Harvard symbologist Dr Robert Langdon, who deciphers occult signs in Renaissance artworks about Jesus in these clunky adaptations of the bestsellers by Dan Brown (whose books had specified that the hero resembled Harrison Ford).\nA nosy suburbanite obsessed with his neighbours\u2019 supposed dirty dealings? That\u2019s the role here with which Hanks does his best. Maybe it would have worked better if he was the straightahead good guy whose innocent pastimes were misinterpreted.\nA darker role for Hanks; notable, although it doesn\u2019t really play to his strengths. He plays a mob hitman in 1930s Chicago who, with his small son in tow, is going to track down the guys who killed most of his family. A high-minded oddity on his CV.\nClint Eastwood directed Hanks in this true-life hagiopic about the heroic airline pilot Chesley \u201cSully\u201d Sullenberger III who, with staggering coolness under pressure, landed his damaged US Airways Flight 1549 on New York\u2019s Hudson river and got all 155 passengers and crew off unscathed, only later to suffer an investigation from the contemptible pen-pushers and corporate bean-counters. Not a bad role for Hanks, but it doesn\u2019t quite come to life.\nHanks is the cool counterweight to a young Leonardo DiCaprio here; he plays the stolid, even-tempered FBI man on the trail of DiCaprio\u2019s notorious teenage conman in this stranger-than-fiction true story. While DiCaprio fakes being a lawyer or an airline pilot, Hanks is the authentic authority figure, who seems to have a sneaking admiration for DiCaprio\u2019s ingenious illegal hi-jinks.\nPlaying opposite a big adorable dog is something only an adorable actor can do. Hanks plays a cop called Turner, who has to take care of a big, sloppy lovable dog called Hooch who is the only witness to his owner\u2019s murder. There is joint relatability and some inter-species chemistry, it has to be admitted, and this film played an important part in establishing Hanks\u2019s brand identity.\nAgain, it is weird here to see Hanks play someone who is not the good guy. He is playing something of a cynical slimeball in this true-life political drama from the screenwriter Aaron Sorkin and the director Mike Nichols. Hanks is the 80s Reagan-era congressman Wilson who masterminded the covert war against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan. He brings natural charisma and presence, but the part-sentimental-part-cynical vibe feels wrong.\nHanks is not like Meryl Streep: accents are not his thing. But here he is giving us an outrageous Ryussh-yun ick-syent as a wacky innocent from a fictional ex-Soviet state who has to live hobo-ishly in New York\u2019s JFK airport terminal building when a coup back home renders him stateless. Stanley Tucci plays the flustered immigration officer who has to deal with him. As so often in Hanks\u2019s CV, his mojo would work better as the kindly authority figure.\nRobert Zemeckis\u2019s film, with Hanks as the FedEx employee who is marooned on a desert island, is taken very seriously by Hanks fans; the initial \u201ccrash\u201d scene is certainly a corker, and Hanks is also a likable castaway with his tattered trousers and straggly beard, capering with self-congratulatory delight when he makes fire for the first time. But there is something a bit silly about this; with anyone less seductive than Hanks, it would have sunk.\nIn his senior years, Hanks has a new mastery of playing iconic real-life figures who are part of the US\u2019s pop-cultural landscape. Here he is playing Walt Disney; really, no other casting was possible. He is the kindly, persistent movie impresario persuading Emma Thompson\u2019s cantankerous author PL Travers into letting him do a film version of her creation Mary Poppins. As ever, Hanks is a genius at embodying pure likability and his Disney has to be a nice guy (there is no question of mentioning the darker sides to Disney\u2019s personality). In fact, most people will assume that Disney was naturally like Tom Hanks.\nMaybe it is wrong to bracket these together, at least partly because Sleepless in Seattle is appreciably better: lighter of touch, lighter in heart. In SiS, Hanks is still in his big-haired younger-man mode, but by YGM, he is older with smaller hair. But, of course, it is still very much Hanks in each case conducting a poignantly/hilariously long-range relationship with Meg Ryan and jointly becoming the nation\u2019s sweethearts. They work well together, without a doubt.\nHanks is an actor born to work with Steven Spielberg; in many ways, he is the actorly embodiment of what Spielberg is as a director, and he gives a richly entertaining and watchable performance as the renowned Washington Post editor and liberal lion Ben Bradlee, sparring amiably with his boss Kay Graham (Streep) as they chase the Pentagon Papers scoop in 1971, which paved the way for the paper\u2019s Watergate investigation. In this role, Hanks delivers pure Jimmy Stewart decency straight into your veins.\nA great early role for the boyish and unthreateningly cherubic Hanks, who at the time was considered by some pundits insufficiently like a leading man. He is the single guy who falls for the mermaid who saves him from drowning and who comes to Manhattan to get wet and reveal her true nature in his bathtub \u2013 although the film adroitly swims around the potential for smut. Darryl Hannah is terrific in this (and there is a Hollywood sexism story to be told in the list of Hanks\u2019s female leads whose careers have faded while his has motored ever onward). Hanks first sneakily gained cinemagoers\u2019 love in this film, as the boy-next-door who is the man-next-door.\nA key moment in Hanks\u2019s early-90s golden age, winning an Oscar in this courtroom drama for playing a gay man who contracts HIV and sues his employer for wrongful dismissal. In some ways, the film conforms to the \u201cliberal balancing\u201d template by pairing Hanks with Denzel Washington as his personal-injury lawyer who is a soon-to-be-reformed homophobe, and there is a new debate now about straight actors playing gay. But nothing could have signalled empathy and respect more clearly than casting Hanks. It is a Hollywood \u201cissue\u201d movie, yes, with the self-consciousness that this implies; but Hanks brings intelligence and sensitivity.\nYou do not expect to see Tom Hanks in an action movie, but that is what\u2019s happening in this gripping hijack thriller from the director Paul Greengrass, based on a true story. Hanks plays the merchant navy captain in charge of a colossal container ship as it sails round the Horn of Africa, a great big slow-moving easy target for Somali pirates with semi-automatic rifles, motivated by poverty. Hanks gives a great performance as the authority figure under stress; the good guy who, like everyone else, is at the mercy of the vast globalised forces of capital.\nThis fantasy comedy, directed by Penny Marshall and written by Gary Ross and Anne Spielberg (sister of Steven), features Hanks in his \u00fcber-Hanks role, the breakout part that really did put him on the map. It is a role that speaks to everyone who feels in their heart that they are impostors, deeply implausible as adults and basically bewildered (or excited) little kids. Hanks plays Josh Baskin, the boy who resents the rules laid down for kids, wishes to be big and then \u2026 well \u2026 be careful what you wish for. Like no one else, Hanks could persuasively embody an adult with adult presence who is nonetheless someone with a child\u2019s innocence and fun. (Try to imagine Tom Cruise doing it, and you realise how quickly it could be a scary movie.) It is never better demonstrated than in the giant toy piano scene, with Hanks joyously dancing on the keys.\nAnother great Spielberg-Hanks pairing, with Hanks rising to the challenge of a big movie on a big subject. He is the everyman hero Captain Miller in the second world war after D-day who leads a platoon whose purpose is to find Private Ryan (Matt Damon) on the field of battle and order him home on compassionate grounds, because all his brothers have been killed. Importantly, Miller is not a professional soldier, but a teacher in civilian life, someone who feels the burden of leadership keenly, but with great modesty and seriousness: a matter of civic values rather than macho heroism. He also has to try concealing that he has a tremor in his hand. The paradox of Hanks is that he is pure Hollywood star quality mixed with self-effacement and it works very well in a drama where the huge impacts of warfare distract you from the acting.\nOne of the very few Hanks movies in his later period in which he goes toe-to-toe with an actor of equal heavyweight stature \u2013 and the result is a balanced double act, rather than a Hanks leading turn. Mark Rylance plays the Soviet spy Rudolf Abel in early 60s America, whom the US government was about to hand over to the Russians in a spy-swap at the Glienicke bridge linking east and west Berlin, the \u201cbridge of spies\u201d. This hair-raisingly dangerously manoeuvre is planned by Abel\u2019s modest but courageous lawyer James Donovan, played of course by Hanks; a man whose amateur enthusiasm and impulsiveness marks him out as a non-diplomat, but someone who nonetheless gets things done. Hanks\u2019s Donovan is superb: homely, wily and sweet, an inspired straight man to the deadpan humour of Rylance\u2019s spy. \u201cAren\u2019t you worried?\u201d Hanks asks Rylance, who comes back with: \u201cWould it help?\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s no crying in baseball!\u201d Hanks delivers a classic axiom in this Penny Marshall gem, about the foundation of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League during the second world war. He is the grumpy former baseball star who hit the skids due to booze, and is now given his comeback chance by managing what he derisively thinks is an absurd novelty: a female baseball team, featuring Geena Davis, Rosie O\u2019Donnell and Madonna. It\u2019s when he yells at right-fielder Evelyn Gardner (played by Bitty Schram) for screwing up that she begins to cry, and he lets her have it with that iconic line. Perhaps this is the one and only time that Hanks fully inhabits an unsympathetic role, and that is probably only because we know it\u2019s just temporary, and that he is basically a father/brother figure, subordinate to the women and bound to be redeemed by them.\nIf Hanks has a late-period masterpiece, it is his extraordinary work in this film about the real-life US children\u2019s TV presenter Fred Rogers in the late-90s, when he was sliding out of fashion and a little derided by the media establishment. However, he succeeds in profoundly impressing a cynical hardbitten magazine journalist (played by Matthew Rhys) who has come to interview him. This is a genuinely complex, difficult-to-read performance from Hanks, who creates an amazingly detailed, eccentric collection of physical and vocal mannerisms based on the real Rogers, quite different from the aw-shucks routine that people might more readily associate with him. It is especially amazing when he asks Rhys to remain absolutely silent with him over lunch in a restaurant for a solid minute so that they can reflect on the people important to them.\nLook upon the colossal importance of Forrest Gump in Hanks\u2019s career and in 90s Hollywood generally, ye mighty arbiters of taste, and despair! If not despair, exactly, then sadly concede the massive showbusiness firepower that Hanks brought to this folksy parable of \u2026 what exactly? Robert Zemeckis (second only to Marshall and Spielberg as a Hanks director) shot this Zelig-ish, or John Irving-ish story of a young man growing up in the 50s with learning difficulties (as no one then phrased it) and a low IQ, whose essential innocence, niceness and luck cause him to rise to greatness, with a college football career, distinguished service in Vietnam, mastery of table-tennis, a thriving shrimp-fishing business and then brilliance in stock-market investment \u2013 and he becomes a national celebrity for running across the whole country. It is the walk and halting voice that nail it (he was to modify it a little bit, arguably, for his performance in A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood). Forrest Gump was made in Bill Clinton\u2019s 90s, but Gump is pure Reagan: the simple patriot who wins through.\nThe pure essence of Hanks is distilled for his inspired vocal role as Woody in Pixar\u2019s glorious animated Toy Story movies. He voices the pull-string cowboy figure who is the favourite toy of Andy, but in danger of being supplanted in his affections by astronaut Buzz Lightyear (voiced by Tim Allen), just as westerns were supplanted by space-race-inspired sci-fi in America\u2019s heart generally. Hanks\u2019s vocal work in these movies is a total joy, and it is one of the most heartwarming, heartrending pieces of casting in Hanks\u2019s career. It also puts him under pressure as an actor in a way few of his other films have, especially in TS2, when his old toy comrades tell him to forget about being the favourite of fickle kids and instead embrace being the pampered possession of adult collectors, because children will only break your heart. There is greatness in this.\nSomething very, very wrong has happened and the whole world holds its breath. The Nasa moon missions, which the US and every other country had come to take for granted as an untarnished, ongoing success, look like becoming a terrible catastrophe. In 1970, the Apollo 13 spacecraft suffers an onboard explosion on its way to the moon, depriving it of most of its electric power and oxygen. There is every chance its astronauts will die, in real time, on national television. Who can save them and all of us? Who can pluck a pyrrhic victory from this defeat?\nThe answer of course is the solid, dependably heroic Hanks, playing Apollo 13\u2019s modest commander Jim Lovell, on whose memoir this movie is based. It is directed with a sure hand by Ron Howard, creating a wonderfully well-made, suspenseful, exciting, poignant Hollywood classic. Hanks is an actor who has something Nasa-ish in his own professionalism, a guy who has refined and fortified his technique over a long period of time and just gets on with it. Cleverly, it is the calm and unshowy Hanks who negotiates the loss of innocence involved in all this: the Apollo 13 near-miss was the event that showed that the US was not all-powerful and also caused the country to begin losing interest in moon landings.\nImportantly, Hanks leads the operation that brings Apollo 13 and its pilots back, unharmed, and brings our idealism back to Earth as battered but also unharmed. This was a heroic adventure, given an added piquancy by the fact that they didn\u2019t get what they wanted. And Hanks embodies all of this: tough, resourceful, a leader, a pragmatist and a modest hero.",

Its regional director, Hans Kluge, said: \u201cWhile the situation remains very serious, we are starting to see some encouraging signs. Italy, which has the highest number of cases in the region, has just seen a slightly lower rate of increase.\u201d\nSpain has announced \u200ba further 655 coronavirus fatalities, taking the country\u2019s total to more than 4,000. As the increase is below the daily rise recorded on Wednesday it offers support to government claims that the rise in deaths in Spain is stabilising.\nIndia has announced a 1.7tn-rupee ($22.5bn/\u00a318.9bn) economic stimulus plan to help millions of people \u200baffected by a nationwide lockdown. \u201cWe do not want anyone to remain hungry,\u201d said the finance minister. He said the government aims to distribute 5 kilograms of staple foodgrains wheat or rice for each person free of charge, with a kilogram of pulses for every low-income family, helping to feed about 800 million poor people over the next three months.\nThe health ministry confirmed another 157 deaths from the virus in the last 24 hours, taking Iran\u2019s total to 2,234 fatalities. A record 2,389 new cases had been recorded over the same period. Five days ago, the numbers being infected daily was below 900.\nMoscow has announced it will close restaurants, bars, parks, and shops other than grocery stores and pharmacies. It came as Russia posted record growth of confirmed coronavirus cases for the second day in a row. Russia now has 840 cases, a rise \u200bof 182 in 24 hours. The Kremlin has \u200b halted all international air traffic, both for airlines and charter flights, excluding flights repatriating Russian citizens to the country.\nUS deaths from the coronavirus pandemic have topped 1,000. Worldwide, the death toll climbed past 21,000, according to a running count kept by Johns Hopkins University, and the US had 1,046 deaths and nearly 70,000 infections. The US Senate passed a $2.2tn emergency relief package marking the biggest rescue deal of its kind in US history.\nChina reported no new locally transmitted cases for the second day in a row. Mainland China did, however, report an increase in the number of new confirmed coronavirus cases, all of which involved travellers arriving from abroad. Almost one in five coronavirus cases in Singapore are among people who travelled from London.\nThe economic downturn and job losses caused by the pandemic is likely to be worse than the 2008 recession, according to World Trade Organization projections.",

The instruction came after a managed fire in West Yorkshire got out of control and spread into a mile-long fire front.\nWest Yorkshire fire brigade urged all landowners to cease controlled burning after the uncontained moorland fire at Deer Hill reservoir in Marsden tied up firefighters for days.\nThe fire brigade said: \u201cWe are currently trying to focus our resources on supporting the national effort to respond to coronavirus and this is unhelpful to us. We will be making every effort to contact landowners over the forthcoming days and to reiterate this message.\n\u201cIt is not where we want to be focusing our energies at this time.\u201d\nCampaigners say their request was ignored by many landowners, and this week the Moorland Association stepped in to call for landowners to cease burning.\nThe association said: \u201cFollowing the increased risks of wildfire and Covid-19 restrictions we have supported the suspension of heather burning and have advised our members to use cutting instead.\u201d\nLandowners burn moorland to remove old shoots and expose new shoots that are a source of food for grouse, in preparation for the shooting season. They have threatened to take legal action if the government imposes a ban on burning.\nMoorland burning is condemned by environmentalists, and the environment minister, Zac Goldsmith, has promised to put an end to the burning with a new law. He has said legislation is necessary because a voluntary approach has not worked.\nPeat bogs, a threatened moorland habitat, are one of the UK\u2019s biggest carbon stores, yet they are intensively managed by grouse moor estates, who burn the moorland heather to maximise numbers of grouse for shooting.\nGreen campaigners argue the burning harms the environment and wildlife by releasing climate-changing gases into the atmosphere, worsening flooding and degrading a precious habitat.\nThe Peak District national park \u2013 where several moorland fires have got out of control, has also asked people to cease burning.\nSarah Fowler, the park\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cAt a time when our emergency services are already under enormous strain as a result of Covid-19, it is vital that we do not add to this pressure.\n\u201cWith these services already stretched, we cannot expect our fire crews to attend incidents that are putting their teams in close proximity to each other, as well as the risk placed on moorland managers not being able to heed the need for social distancing, and taking fire crews to often remote locations. Our focus must rightly be on supporting the coronavirus response for all our local communities.\u201d\nFowler said it was unacceptable the burning was taking place at a time when many wildlife species were at the beginning of their breeding season. The burning season begins on 1 October and lasts until April.\nCampaigners said a curb on burning should be made permanent. Luke Steele, a spokesman for Ban Bloodsports on Yorkshire\u2019s Moors, said: \u201cIt speaks volumes that it has taken grouse shoot operators sparking a mile-long fire on Meltham Moor during a national emergency to persuade the Moorland Association to call off the burning season.\n  \u201cBurning moorland on sensitive peatland degrades ecosystems releases climate-altering gases into the atmosphere and worsens flooding and wildfire risk.\u201d\n Steele said there had been more than 550 burning incidents recorded on Yorkshire\u2019s moors since October, including fires that had started after the request to cease from the West Yorkshire fire brigade. He said it was time the government ensured the burning season ended for good.\nThe Moorland Association said they decided to ask for burning to be suspended after being contacted by a large number of landowners who had already ceased controlled burning.\nAmanda Anderson, director of the MA said: \u201cControlled burning is an important tool in managing our moorlands when used in the right place at the right time. This is not the right time.\u201d",

Many victims \u2026 do not self-identify, which means that quantifying the number of victims is challenging,\u201d it said.

A week ago the number of confirmed cases in the US was around 9,000, before a rapid increase in both spread and testing.\nThe Federal Reserve earlier this month dropped interest rates practically to zero and when asked if there was a blank check to support the economy, Powell said there was not but there was a tremendous amount the bank could do to get America through the crisis.\n\u201cWe do have the ability to use our emergency lending authorities \u2026 we can continue to make loans and the point of all that is to support the flow of credit into the economy,\u201d Powell said. He said the only backstop to such spending would be the Treasury.\n\u201cInvestors have pulled back which means that capital markets that support [things like] mortgages and car loans just stopped working. We can support that with our emergency powers. Where credit is not flowing we can step in and offer those loans and we will step in,\u201d he said.\nAsked if the economy could handle a months-long shutdown if that\u2019s what the US public health emergency requires, Powell spoke of the unique situation.\n\u201cPeople are being asked to close their businesses and stay home, at a certain point we will get the virus under control and at that point confidence will return,\u201d he said, adding that the rebound at that point could be \u201cvigorous\u201d.\nPowell said the public health crisis must be dealt with first \u201cthen let the economy bounce back\u201d, not \u201crush in to opening the economy\u201d.\n\u201cThe first order of business is to get the spread of the virus under control and then resume economic activity,\u201d he said.\nAsked if an economic recession was inevitable or, indeed, already under way, he said: \u201cWe may well be in a recession,\u201d while emphasizing that the downturn came on the back of an exceptionally, fundamentally strong economy.\n\u201cThe virus is going to dictate the timetable,\u201d he said.\nAsked if the bank could \u201crun out of ammo\u201d to combat the effect of the virus on the economy, Powell said the Fed would not run out of financial ammunition and when the economy began to recover \u201cwe will be there to make sure it\u2019s as strong as possible.\u201d\nBefore the outbreak, Trump had repeatedly criticized Powell personally, and the Federal Reserve, in public, calling the chairman \u201cclueless\u201d and the bank \u201cpathetic\u201d among other attacks.\nPowell said: \u201cWe are totally focused on our mission of serving the American people, we try to do our best to serve them, we do not let anything else get into our thinking, that\u2019s the way it always is at the Fed, it\u2019s deep in our DNA.\u201d\nHis closing message was a plea and a note of encouragement to the public.\n\u201cWe have asked people to step back from economic activity for the public good. The Fed is working hard to support you now,\u201d he said.\nMeanwhile Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and\n Infectious Diseases, warned that it was too soon for the country to\n consider going back to normal.\n \u201cThe US is not unidimensional, so what we\u2019re seeing is two components\n of how you address an outbreak \u2013 containment, in which you try to\n identify each individual person infected, get them out of circulation\n and do contact-tracing.\u201d\n But that, he told New York\u2019s WNYC, was a strategy \u201cwe needed to do\n before it became a massive outbreak\u201d.\n In a city like New York, which is now the center of the outbreak, the strategy now is mitigation.\n But Fauci said of Trump setting Easter, 12 April, as an aspirational goal to get the country back to work, \u201che knows, and we\u2019ve discussed it with him, that he has to be very flexible on that.\n \u201cHe put that out because he wants to give people some hope, but he is\n not absolutely wed to that,\u201d Fauci added.\n In an address on Wednesday, New York\u2019s mayor, Bill de Blasio, warned that more than 4 million New Yorkers \u2013 or 50% of the city\u2019s population \u2013\n will get the coronavirus.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fair bet to say that half of all New Yorkers and maybe more than half will end up contracting this disease,\u201d De Blasio said at a city hall press briefing about the outbreak as the Big Apple\u2019s positive cases approached 18,000 with close to 200 deaths.",

Forced by the coronavirus pandemic to shut up shop, the Museum Catharijneconvent in Utrecht is offering a taste of its latest exhibition on miracles and their depiction in art through a phone line.\nOption one for callers is to hear all about a miracle experienced by a staff member, Simone, who survived the 2004 tsunami in the Indian Ocean. Option three is for callers to record their own description of a miraculous experience, potentially to be showcased in the exhibit.\nBut in these troubling times it may be option two \u2013 the chance to request one\u2019s very own supernatural event \u2013 that will prove the most popular. \u201cDo you want to experience a miracle?\u201d callers are asked.\n\u201cIt was just a bit of a joke before the coronavirus,\u201d said Rosa van der Wielen, a spokeswoman for the museum. \u201cBut it would be very nice now if people put their requests on the website, that would be a very good idea.\u201d\nIt is yet to be seen how many people avail themselves of the option in the weeks and months to come. Some technical problems temporarily put the line out of action on Thursday, but the subject matter of the museum\u2019s exhibition may feel prescient to many.\nThe All Wonders exhibition was due to be opened to the public at the end of this month but its launch has been delayed until June at least in light of measures to try to halt the spread of Covid-19.\nThe lack of firm evidence of the existence of miracles obliged the museum to retain a healthy scepticism. Artworks included in the exhibition include depictions of Lazarus in an etching by Rembrandt and in a lifesize painting by the 17th-century painter Carel Fabritius. Visitors can watch a clip from the music video for Lazarus by David Bowie, a track recorded shortly before his death in 2016.\nBut the museum had wanted to explore all avenues, including \u201cmiracles\u201d whose authenticity had been questioned. The curators explored whether it was possible to include a 1937 painting, The Holy Virgin of Welberg by Wijnand Geraedts, depicting Janske Gorissen, a young woman from the Dutch village of Welberg.\nGorissen claimed to have had visions of Mary and the archangel Gabriel in the 1930s. Her bedroom became a site of pilgrimage to thousands. But due to growing doubts over the story, a Vatican commission in 1951 eventually concluded that no miracle had occurred.\n\u201cUnfortunately, the bishop of Breda has put the painting and all archive documents of this case under lock and key,\u201d one of the curators, Marije De Nood, told De Volkskrant newspaper. \u201cNo one is allowed to see the painting.\u201d\nA second controversial miracle is thoroughly explored, however. In the early 1930s, five young children from Beauraing, a city in Belgium, claimed to have seen the Virgin Mary. They appeared to go into ecstasy when they prayed.\nTo test whether the children were lying, doctors put a burning match on the hand of Gilberte Degeimbre, who at the age of nine was the youngest girl in the group. Gilberte was said not to have sustained any burns, and the bishop of Namur confirmed the supernatural nature of the experience in 1949. Degeimbre died in 2015 at the age of 92. Clothes she wore as a child will be part of the show.",

        "content": "The man behind the much-maligned musical film has shared some of its secrets \u2013 prepare to be baffled\nTom Hooper, the Oscar-winning director of The King\u2019s Speech, has revealed some of the logic behind the creative choices guiding his most recent film, Cats.\nA starry version of Andrew Lloyd Webber\u2019s hit stage musical, Cats primarily met with ridicule, nausea and confusion when it premiered just before Christmas last year. Critics queried the special effects and eroticism, audiences largely stayed away and some of the stars disowned the film.\nHooper\u2019s director\u2019s commentary, recorded for the film\u2019s home entertainment release, sheds light on some of the decisions behind what is regarded as one of the most calamitous missteps in movie history.\nThough Hooper does not directly address the film\u2019s reception on the audio track, some of his insights defend - or defer \u2013 widely reviled choices, including the moment where Rebel Wilson\u2019s tabby cat unzips her own fur \u2013 to reveal a further layer of further beneath.\n\u201cThis gag,\u201d says Hooper, \u201cis kind of my own tongue-in-cheek way of referencing that I\u2019m using digital fur as clothing because Rebel actually unzips her digital fur to reveal it as clothing. But then the joke is that underneath she has more real fur, which of course is not real fur.\u201d\nOther baffling elements are also discussed by Hooper, who credited Wilson with the idea of having the mice her character enslaves and terrorises played by children. He then adds: \u201cWomen playing cockroaches \u2013 whose only unusual trait is that they have an extra pair of arms, in homage to the cockroach number of limbs.\u201d\nWilson appeared on stage at this year\u2019s Oscars alongside her Cats co-star James Corden to present the award for best visual effects. In their introduction, the pair referenced the poor reviews the film \u2013 and its effects in particular \u2013 had attracted.\nThe following day, the pair and the telecast\u2019s producers were criticised by the VFX Society, saying \u201cthe best visual effects in the world will not compensate for a story told badly.\u201d\nIn his commentary, Hooper praises the \u201cgreat acting\u201d of the duo, in particular Corden\u2019s apparent break of the fourth wall in an alley-set scene. \u201cI love the idea that James is sort of stepping out of the film for a moment to acknowledge the kind of natural tension between their claim that they were cats and the kind of hybrid design.\u201d\nHooper credits other actors with grace notes in the movie, including one unscripted look exchanged by Judi Dench\u2019s Old Deuteronomy and Ian McKellen\u2019s Gus the theatre cat, which indicates the pair were once lovers. Dench and McKellen, said Hooper, \u201cdecided their cats had some sort of romantic backstory\u201d.\nHooper, 47, has not yet announced his next project, but his commentary does give some insight into his current activities. \u201cI must admit I\u2019ve actually tried bowing down to a cat and saying \u2018Oh cat\u2019 just in the slight hope that it might unleash the cat to talk to me,\u201d he says. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t yet worked, but I will continue trying.\u201d",

        "content": "Survey shows how pandemic is affecting mental health \u2013 and suggests what can help\nMillions of people in the UK are feeling panicked and unprepared for the coronavirus outbreak, according to a poll showing how the virus is affecting mental health.\nThe survey, carried out before a full lockdown was imposed, found that more than one in five adults in the UK had felt panicked and three in 10 had felt afraid because of coronavirus. More than six in 10 adults (62%) said they had felt anxious or worried.\n\u201cThis poll was carried out before full lockdown was introduced. Even then, there were clear indications that the pandemic was beginning to have a significant impact on the nation\u2019s mental health,\u201d said Dr Antonis Kousoulis, the director of research at the Mental Health Foundation, which commissioned the YouGov poll.\nHe said the concern was that the longer mental health problems persisted, the worse they would become. \u201cAmong the issues we will need to monitor are impacts on levels of trauma, suicidal thoughts and mental health vulnerability.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cThat is why it is incredibly important that we act now. We are not powerless. There are many things we can do, individually and collectively, to tackle and prevent mental health problems, with much help and advice available.\u201d\nThe poll found that nearly one in three people had felt unprepared, one in 10 had felt lonely and nearly one in five (18%) had felt hopeless.\nThe findings will form part of a larger study that will monitor the impact of coronavirus on mental health, a project launched by the Mental Health Foundation in partnership with the Institute of Public Health at the University of Cambridge.\nKousoulis said there was some good news among the findings, with people showing empathy for others and willingness to help. \u201cVolunteering is one of the things that research shows helps improve our mental health and the mental health of others,\u201d he said.\nMental health charities say the coronavirus pandemic is causing increased stress and anxiety, particularly among people with existing mental health problems.\nThe World Health Organization has acknowledged that the crisis is generating stress and has advised people to avoid watching, reading or listening to news that causes feelings of anxiety or distress.\nStephen Buckley, of the mental health charity Mind, said: \u201cWe know that the coronavirus and its impact are causing stress and worry for many people. If you already have a mental health problem, it\u2019s possible that the worries of coronavirus may be affecting how you\u2019re coping.\u201d\nQuarantine or self-isolation is likely to have a negative impact on mental wellbeing. A review of the psychological impact of quarantine, published in the Lancet in February, said: \u201cSeparation from loved ones, the loss of freedom, uncertainty over disease status, and boredom, can on occasion create dramatic effects. Suicide has been reported, substantial anger generated, and lawsuits brought following the imposition of quarantine in previous outbreaks.\n\u201cThe potential benefits of mandatory mass quarantine need to be weighed carefully against the possible psychological costs.\u201d\nThe Mental Health Foundation offers advice on mental health issues relating to the pandemic, which can be found here.\nYouGov polled 2,126 people over the age of 18 on 17 and 18 March.\nIn the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

Nobody will starve. There is a \u00a31bn more food in people\u2019s larders than there was a couple of weeks ago. What are they doing with it? How much do you need to eat? How much do you need to store away?\u201d\nThe businessman urged shoppers to \u201cshow some restraint\u201d and not to waste anything. If they did this there would be enough food on supermarket shelves to satisfy the needs of vulnerable members of society, some of whom are struggling to buy food.\nRecent data showed that the average spend per supermarket trip had risen 16% in the week ending 17 March. In the same period there were an additional 15m food shopping trips \u2013 an increase of 12% \u2013 according to the market analysts Kantar.\nWith all the major grocers\u2019 online delivery slots booked up for weeks in advance, getting food to households that are self-isolating has become a top priority for supermarkets. Grocery bosses are being given access to a government database to help prioritise food deliveries for elderly and vulnerable shoppers who have been ordered to stay at home.\nRose, who has just recovered from coronavirus, channelled his inner chef as he urged people to plan their meals and show some frugality. \u201cIf you buy a chicken, roast the chicken, have the roast chicken dinner, the following day turn it into a stir fry, the following day make it into soup,\u201d he said. \u201cWe live in a very profligate society: we buy too much, we eat too much, we consume too much, and we have to learn new ways.\u201d",

We anticipated this might happen in the very stressful circumstances for many families.\u201d\nCharities and police forces across the country have been warning of a potential rise in cases of domestic violence. In China there was a threefold increase in cases reported to police stations in February compared with the previous year.\nThe justice secretary, Robert Buckland, told the Commons justice committee this week that there may be more cases of domestic abuse, online crime and fraud during the lockdown.\nHughes later said the overall level of domestic abuse cases was as expected, but officers had begun to classify incidents believed to have a connection to the virus.\nShe said families were being asked to stay at home and many had significantly less money as a result of the restrictions.\nHughes said: \u201cThe potential for tension to arise in the home as a result of what we are asking people to cope with, in order to suppress the virus, is going to increase and therefore we would be right to think this might display itself in an increase in the number of domestic incidents we are called to.\n\u201cWe are preparing for that. Some of those most serious incidents will be challenging to deal with, particularly if the victim needs to be moved to a refuge, but the police specialise in these kind of cases and the local partners, local authorities, they\u2019re working together really closely to prepare for that.\u201d\nAvon and Somerset police reported a 20.9% increase in domestic abuse incidents in the last two weeks, from 718 to 868. Police in Cumbria have asked postal workers and delivery drivers to look out for signs of abuse.\nDCI Dan St Quintin, of Cumbria police, said: \u201cIn the coming weeks and months we ask for everyone to look out for each other as much as possible. We would also like to extend this plea to those such as postal workers, delivery drivers, food delivery companies and carers who will still be visiting houses, to keep an eye out for any signs of abuse and to report any concerns to us.\u201d\nQuintin said the Bright Sky app, which can be disguised for people worried about partners checking their phones, provided support and information for victims.\nThe National Centre for Domestic Violence said it fully supported the plea and warned of \u201chuge dangers lurking for victims\u201d..\nIts chief executive, Mark Groves, said: \u201cWhile the whole country grapples with the consequences of Covid-19, there are huge dangers lurking for victims of domestic abuse and violence. We fully support Cumbria police\u2019s plea to key workers to help the police investigate suspicions or concerns surrounding victims or perpetrators.\u201d\nThe Thames Valley chief constable, John Campbell, said his force expected to see a rise in the number of domestic abuse calls He said domestic violence and fraud would become a priority for his force as \u201ccriminals decide to change their behaviours\u2019 to take advantage of coronavirus\u201d.\n\u201cWe are seeing and monitoring very closely the issues around domestic abuse, we anticipate that it might increase and we will deal with that robustly in a way that you would expect us to,\u201d Campbell said.\nShanika Varga, a solicitor at Stowe Family Law, who specialises in domestic abuse cases, said: \u201cBeing stuck in a house together for two weeks or longer means the risk of a situation becoming violent is much higher. Lots of people \u2013 whether they realise it or not \u2013 are in abusive relationships, and abusers will typically manipulate any situation to take advantage of their perceived position of power.\u201d\nVarga urged victims to start thinking of a contingency plan for escaping their abusers. \u201cKnowing your options and making sure people are informed and fully prepared to take action if need be is vital. Don\u2019t forget that help is out there,\u201d she said.",

British homes are using more electricity as people stay in and work from home, but this increase has been more than offset by the steep drop in demand for electricity at factories, construction sites and offices.\nElectricity demand is expected to fall further as major industries continue to close down to help stem the spread of the pandemic, which should help lead to lower overall emissions in 2020 alongside rising renewable energy generation.\nMore than a third (36.9%) of the UK\u2019s electricity was generated by renewable energy sources including wind farms, solar panels and biomass-fuelled power plants in 2019, a record for the sector. The average in the last three months of the year rose to 37.4%, the highest ever recorded for this time of year.\nWind power alone generated almost a fifth of the UK\u2019s electricity over the year as a whole, divided equally between onshore and offshore wind projects, in large part boosted by rising generation from the new Hornsea offshore wind project off the Yorkshire coast, which is the largest offshore wind farm in the world.\nMelanie Onn, RenewableUK\u2019s deputy chief executive, said the records will continue as the UK moves away from fossil fuels to reach net zero emissions as fast as possible.\n\u201cAs well as wind, we\u2019ll use innovative new technologies like renewable hydrogen and marine power, and we\u2019ll scale up battery storage,\u201d she said.\n\u201cLow-cost renewables are central to the government\u2019s energy strategy and our sector will grow rapidly in the years ahead, as our domestic supply chain expands and we continue to seize multibillion pound export opportunities around the world,\u201d Onn added.",

        "content": "The manager, squad and coaching staff have accepted wage deferrals to help others as football takes a back seat\nThe plinth supporting the landmark statue of Billy Bremner outside Elland Road bears a simple, yet evocative, message. \u201cSide before self, every time,\u201d it declares, reminding everyone of the former Leeds United captain\u2019s personal mantra.\nIn a very different way and a very different context, Marcelo Bielsa\u2019s Leeds are now showing they are every bit as big on teamwork as the trophy-hoarding, no-quarter-given Don Revie side Bremner led with such a memorable mixture of finesse and ferocity.\nThe Championship leaders\u2019 reaction to being stuck in a coronavirus emergency-induced holding pattern with the Premier League clearly visible on the horizon has been impressively mature and measured. On Thursday Bielsa, his players, senior coaching staff and club executives accepted a wage deferral in order to protect the jobs and incomes of 272 less well remunerated members of the club\u2019s backroom staff and its army of casual workers. Other teams are now expected to follow suit.\nBremner was aptly described as \u201c10 stone of barbed wire\u201d on the pitch but he would surely have approved of the current Leeds captain Liam Cooper\u2019s role in negotiating an arrangement designed to prevent the loss of homes and livelihoods. In the absence of the customary 35,000 matchday crowds at Elland Road Leeds are, according to their chief executive, Angus Kinnear, losing \u201cmillions of pounds\u201d per month.\nWith a \u00a340m annual wage bill becoming unsustainable, first-teamers have agreed to their wages being temporarily capped \u2013 a reduction to a sum in the region of \u00a36,000 a week was discussed in recent days \u2013 leaving the balance to come when normality is finally restored. While the average Championship salary is around \u00a312,000 per week, Bielsa\u2019s top earners, Patrick Bamford and Kiko Casilla, command around \u00a330,000.\nNever in Leeds\u2019s 16-year top-flight exile has it been more imperative to secure a Premier League return, with its attendant, \u00a3100m broadcast revenue-funded cash infusion. However, given the lives being lost and the economic crash, the club is not about to feel sorry for itself.\nTop of the second tier and seven points clear of the play-off places with nine games to go, the players could be forgiven for feeling like weary travellers left circling their destination in thick cloud. An awful lot of hard work \u2013 mental as well as physical \u2013 has gone into reaching this position but the bigger picture has been grasped.\nAlready Bielsa\u2019s squad have donated sufficient money to prevent the largely matchday-funded Leeds fans\u2019 food bank from folding, while individual players, most notably Cooper and Stuart Dallas, have gone into role-model mode, using social media to promote social distancing. Holbeck Together, a local charity helping the elderly, has received the club\u2019s entire food stocks.\nCooper and company can only hope the Elland Road larders will be refilled and the season eventually concluded with the team still in the top two. No one wants the current campaign to be voided, with promotion and relegation either suspended for a year or Leeds and second-placed West Brom becoming part of a temporarily extended 22-club top tier. Not playing is bad but the uncertainty about what happens next is worse.\nOr at least so it initially seemed. Daniel Chapman, co-editor of the Square Ball fanzine, encapsulates a now almost unimaginably altered mood among the fans.\n\u201cTwo weeks ago the idea of calling off the season had everyone saying \u2018Typical Leeds\u2019,\u201d wrote Chapman in the Yorkshire Evening Post. \u201cThat\u2019s gone. Any defiance the mirror now shows is mostly wide-eyed fear as I think less often of promotion. The death tolls from Italy are of a scale that can be mapped on to blocks of seating at Elland Road. The notion of the virus being \u2018typically Leeds\u2019 seems absurd now that we can appreciate its global impact on our increasingly local lives.\u201d\nIf and when the Championship campaign resumes Leeds must regain the momentum that was serving them so well. Given the likelihood of playing behind closed doors, they will surely have to do this without their adrenaline-supplying supporters and their incessant \u201cMarching on Together\u201d soundtrack. What effect might that have? And how might a layoff involving players training alone at home influence a team whose high-intensity style demands unusually hard, highly intricate daily training-ground drilling.\nBielsa\u2019s squad went into lockdown with personalised exercise plans, sleep monitoring devices and diet sheets complementing deliveries of exercise bikes and other gym equipment to players\u2019 homes. Daily weigh-ins and body fat monitoring are now undertaken electronically, with the results taken on trust.\nAll head coaches are control freaks to varying extents but for a micro-manager as obsessive as the Argentinian to suddenly be forced into taking such a hands-off approach at a time like this must be particularly disorientating. As his squad cycle and run along Yorkshire\u2019s country roads \u2013 especially those surrounding the footballers\u2019 mecca of Linton, near the market town of Wetherby \u2013 what on earth does Bielsa do? How does he fill the time normally occupied by his famous daily dust inspection at the club\u2019s Thorp Arch training ground.\nDespite his family remaining in Argentina, he has opted to stay on at his modest flat in Wetherby. Bielsa now has little option but to indulge his passions for reading, taking long walks through the adjacent fields he has come to love and, above all, playing an active role in WhatsApp groups created by the players, coaches and medical staff. \u201cThis club\u2019s communication has been second to none,\u201d says Cooper. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot from Marcelo on WhatsApp telling us to stay safe.\u201d\nLeeds fans cannot wait to once more see Bielsa drinking coffee in Wetherby, posing for selfies in Morrisons and listening to music on his headphones as he makes the hour-long walk to Thorp Arch. For the moment though, they can rest assured he and his squad really are all about \u201cside before self\u201d.",

        "content": "On the one hand faceless and frightening, on the other a symbol of heroic resistance to deadly viruses, here\u2019s how the hazmat suit became a symbol of our times\nThey tread slowly, gracelessly, at a plodding pace. With their aspirators they could be astronauts, of this earth but detached from it, sucking clean air through umbilical tubes. They comfort and alarm in equal measure, these slow-moving harbingers of sickness and death. Intellectually, you know they are there to help, to protect. But the hazmat suit creates a divide. There is the person who wears it and the person they need protecting from. You never want to be on the wrong side of a hazmat suit, because if you are, you know something\u2019s gone horribly wrong.\nAs the coronavirus pandemic spreads around the world, images of medical personnel in hazmat suits have become commonplace in newspapers and news bulletins. But it Is not just medics who are donning protective wear. A fortnight ago, Naomi Campbell posted a video in which she explained her motivations for flying in a hazmat suit, accessorised with a Burberry cape. Last week, before the nationwide lockdown, activists in hazmat suits protested outside Downing Street about the government\u2019s sluggish response to coronavirus. Personal protective equipment (PPE) in general has been high up the news agenda, as beleaguered NHS staff warn the government that an inadequate supply is putting frontline health workers at risk.\nThe hazmat suit is a familiar trope in pop culture, seen everywhere from the blockbuster HBO drama Chernobyl to the pandemic blockbusters of the 1990s and 2000s currently being revisited on streaming platforms. Some of us may encounter a person wearing a hazmat suit during the coronavirus pandemic for the first time. But where did the hazmat suit come from? And what does this symbol of man\u2019s resistance to disease and destruction represent in these cringing, uncertain times?\nAs the government scrambles to supply hazmat suits to the hospitals that need them, these are busy times for PPE manufacturers. US firm Dupont, a major supplier of PPE, has ramped up production. Dupont\u2019s David Dominish says that by the first week of the outbreak in Wuhan, the company was shipping more than 30 times the normal volume of hazmat suits to China. Weeks later, this had increased to over 100 times. \u201cWhether it\u2019s avian flu, Ebola, Sars or Covid-19, one thing we know is that whenever a terrible outbreak occurs, the demand becomes nearly infinite,\u201d Dominish says.\nAlthough it is loosely understood in popular culture to refer to a plastic outer layer covering the whole body, there is no uniform hazmat suit. \u201cWe have more than 15 different types of fabric, all with different levels of protection,\u201d Dominish says. Two models in particular are proving popular: the Tyvek 800 J, featuring a hooded coverall, overtaped seams and self-adhesive zipper, and the Tyvek 600 Plus, which comes with attached socks and boot flaps. Hazmat suits may also feature built-in respirators and full masks.\nGetting a licence to produce hazmat suits is a costly and laborious undertaking. \u201cIt can cost \u00a363,000 to get the certificate to make one suit,\u201d says Pam Parker of PPS, a British hazmat suit manufacturer. I ask how the company checks for potential tears. \u201cIt can\u2019t have a tear in it,\u201d says Parker vehemently. \u201cThere is no way there can be a tear.\u201d Every suit is handmade; they are inflated to check for damage by machines and manually inspected before being shipped.\nBefore hazmat suits, there were leather oilskins and sweet-smelling pomanders; masks made out of muslin and perfumed rags. As early as the 1600s, paintings show grave-diggers approaching plague corpses with handkerchiefs over their mouths and noses. \u201cThese practices were not necessarily against contagion as we understand it,\u201d says Dr Christos Lynteris of the University of St Andrews. \u201cIllnesses were believed to emanate from the ground in gaseous form.\u201d\nThe now-iconic Venetian beak-doctor costume was one of the earliest attempts by medical personnel to protect themselves during the bubonic plagues of the 17th century. Attributed to the French doctor Charles de Lorme, it featured a long leather coat with a beak mask containing garlic and rue. In effect, it was a permanent hazmat suit. Unfortunately, it probably made things worse. \u201cA permanent hazmat suit without removal protocols and disinfectant would be a vector of disease,\u201d Lynteris says, \u201crather than something that would stop it.\u201d\nRussian scientists designed a prototype hazmat suit to deal with a plague outbreak in the Volga in the 1870s. \u201cThe suits were never produced, but beautifully designed,\u201d Lynteris says. \u201cThey were designed to prevent imaginary gases from reaching our nostrils. There is a long history of personal protection, but not from bacteria, as scientists didn\u2019t have the understanding of it we do today.\u201d\nThe origins of the modern hazmat suit lie in the Manchurian plague of 1910, where doctor Wu Lien-teh, says Lynteris, \u201chad the theory that the plague was airborne and spread like the flu. He insisted that all doctors, nurses and burial staff wore a simple gauze mask he designed. It was the first time we had a mask devised for use during an epidemic.\u201d\nAt first, Wu was ridiculed by his peers. But when a celebrated French doctor operated without a mask to prove Wu wrong and died days later, everything changed. He saved untold lives. By the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918, masks were commonplace. Through the 20th century, the chemical and nuclear sector developed the modern hazmat suit, with medical versions coming into widespread use during the Ebola outbreaks of the 1990s.\nThe public has always been fascinated by the sight of medical workers in protective gear. \u201cThe Manchurian plague was covered by the media across the globe,\u201d Lynteris says. \u201cBecause newspapers could print photographs, people saw plague masks for the first time. It was a visually powerful image that worked well in black and white.\u201d\n\n  This cultural obsession never abated. In movies and TV shows, hazmat suits evolved into an evocative signifier of peril and death. Part of the reason that the hazmat suit is so useful to film-makers is because it makes visible what cannot be seen to the naked eye: the threat to life posed by disease. The act of donning a hazmat suit and venturing into a stricken area is a visual representation of extreme heroism in films such as Outbreak, Contagion, and Flu. \u201cThey are a great prop to visualise danger,\u201d Lynteris says.\nThe 1995 pandemic blockbuster Outbreak begins with the reflection of a dying man in the mask of epidemiologist Dustin Hoffman\u2019s hazmat suit and the actors wear little else throughout. \u201cDustin was more miserable than he has ever been in his life, wearing that suit \u2013 they were boiling,\u201d says Outbreak costume designer Erica Edell Phillips. The distinctive blue and yellow suits were modelled on those used in the field. Phillips used airflow packs to prevent the helmets from fogging up and remodelled the helmets so the actors\u2019 faces could be seen. \u201cWe wanted the suits to look real, but to have some style,\u201d she says.Warner Bros later rented out her suits to films and TV shows: \u201cThey became the definitive biohazard suit for decades.\u201d\nThe wearing of hazmat suits is central to the plot of Outbreak, underscoring the danger medical personnel confront for the greater good. A scientist who breaches his hazmat suit dies a bloody death. Another character accidentally sticks herself with a needle through the suit: the hazmat suit is imperfect, the boundary between life and death only a scalpel nick away.\n\u201cThe epidemiologist is an interesting cultural hero,\u201d Lynteris says. \u201cThey are part-detective, trying to find patient zero or the animal the disease came from. But they are also someone who promises to restore society.\u201d The hazmat suit signals a looming catastrophe: in these films, a pandemic is usually accompanied by the collapse of society. (In Contagion, Matt Damon watches as home raiders murder his neighbours; in  Flu, screaming shoppers descend locust-like on a supermarket.) \u201cThe epidemiologist is the rational person who brings society back from catastrophe,\u201d Lynteris says. \u201cThey are Noah, the person who will save humanity and restore social order.\u201d\nThe hazmat suit creates a barrier between humanity and nature. Nature is conceived as hostile, full of threat. The opening scene of I Am Legend shows Times Square overgrown by vegetation following a global pandemic. \u201cThe virus is a revenge of nature,\u201d Lynteris says. \u201cIt decimates humanity, and then nature flourishes.\u201d The hazmat suit represents humanity\u2019s resistance to this existential crisis. Like a knight going into battle in a jangling suit of armour, the epidemiologist dons the hazmat suit to wage war on nature.\nOutside of Hollywood, this militaristic tone permeates our thinking about pandemics. \u201cIn epidemiological language, the opposite of a pandemic is called peacetime,\u201d Lynteris says. Meaning that, right now, we are at war with coronavirus \u2013 and the medical personnel you see wearing hazmat suits are soldiers. But as any soldier knows, in war there are casualties. \u201cIt\u2019s still difficult for me to talk about,\u201d says virologist Dr Joseph Fair of his friend Dr Sheik Umar Khan, his voice thick with emotion.\nIn 2014, they worked side by side in Sierra Leone. A staff of around 17 medics had to cope with hundreds of Ebola patients. \u201cThe walls of the hospital were covered in blood, vomit, and stools,\u201d says Fair. \u201cThere was no one to clean them because all the cleaners had died.\u201d When Khan contracted Ebola, Fair desperately tried to arrange a medevac. Two days later, Fair received word that Khan had died. \u201cI completely broke down,\u201d he says. Khan was buried in Kenema, alongside the people he died trying to save.\nFair believes Khan contracted Ebola when taking off his PPE. \u201cThe protective equipment is solid, but it\u2019s when taking it off that people get infected. You are exhausted, you have worked for 23 hours with no sleep; inside the suits, it\u2019s like wearing a garbage bag in sub-Saharan Africa, so you\u2019re sweating non-stop, dehydrated and hungry. Your first inclination when you walk outside is to get the damn thing off as quickly as possible.\u201d\n\u201cSafely removing a PPE requires meticulous concentration,\u201d says Dr JaHyun Kang of Seoul National University and Harvard\u2019s TH Chan school of public health, who has conducted research showing how medical workers can contaminate themselves during the removal of hazmat suits. \u201cWe need to develop better PPE out of more breathable material, so medical workers don\u2019t get so hot and aren\u2019t in such a rush to get them off,\u201d she says. \u201cWe also need to standardise the PPE protocols and train healthcare personnel so they become confident about how to remove PPE without contamination.\u201d\nResearchers are working on improvements. In 2015, a team at Johns Hopkins University redesigned the hazmat suit to make removal safer. In addition to simplifying the zips and improving the cooling system, they created more transparency around the face. \u201cWe tried to make the face very visible \u2026 [That is] really important for someone on their deathbed,\u201d one of the researchers told Wired. But these suits are not yet in widespread use.\nMaking hazmat suits less alienating can save lives. During the 2014 Ebola outbreak in west Africa, infected people avoided medical personnel because their hazmats were frightening. This is an age-old problem: just as in those Ebola-stricken villages, 17th-century plague victims cowered from doctors in their beak suits, Lynteris says.\nOn a fundamental level, being treated by a medical worker whose face is obscured has a dehumanising effect. The patient realises they are no longer just a person, but a vector of disease. A hazmat suit looming over you \u2013 well, it\u2019s not something you ever want to see. But it is better than the alternative: a lonely room, with no medical intervention at all. Because, although the person in a hazmat suit may seem far away, or even uncaring, they are doing the most humane thing imaginable: putting themselves in harm\u2019s way, to save a stranger\u2019s life.",

        "content": "Coronavirus testing checkpoints and isolation units could become features at grounds around the country this summer as English cricket explores the possibility of staging major matches behind closed doors.\nAs it stands there will be no professional cricket in the UK before 28 May at the earliest, and the England and Wales Cricket Board is drafting possible schedules while it waits for the government to give sporting events the green light. There is no guarantee that crowds will be allowed in to grounds when this comes, however. When announcing the delay last week the ECB revealed it was looking into \u201cstarting the season behind closed doors\u201d and \u201cgiving sports fans the opportunity to watch live broadcast action\u201d.\nSteve Elworthy, the tournament director for last year\u2019s World Cup who has since become the ECB\u2019s director of events, is charged with exploring the logistics of this and has outlined the challenge. \u201cWe\u2019re mapping out what international matches would look like behind closed doors,\u201d Elworthy says.\n\u201cThe advice around mass gatherings [before the current period of lockdown] was 500 people or fewer. That was guided by the potential impact on critical services like paramedics and doctors.\n\u201cYou would likely have to work within that number, which includes teams, match officials, support staff, broadcasters and media, commercial partners, safety and security teams, third-party suppliers, replay screen operators, [the teams that control] the LED boards, ground staff, catering and more.\n\u201cThen you have to think about medical provisions, creating a safe and sterile environment around that venue, so that everyone who comes in is clear. So it\u2019s how you test them at the gate, the isolation units that you have to put in. These are all the considerations we are thinking about.\u201d\nThe ECB\u2019s medical team is devising a protocol for how testing would work, as well as possible isolation booths for temporary use while anyone testing positive for Covid-19 waits to leave the ground. There can be around 1,500 people working on a normal major matchday, but it is believed this headcount can be shrunk to some 350 with no spectators, aided by the reduction in stewards and catering.\nHowever, Elworthy\u2019s events team must also consider transport and accommodation logistics for players, staff and officials in a way that ensures the desired \u201csterile\u201d bubble is not only upon arrival at the stadium. While operational manuals for staging domestic cricket behind closed doors will also be produced, internationals have the added complication of travel for the touring teams. Much hinges on the resumption of flights and the lifting of travel restrictions, such as quarantine periods.\nThere are four sets of visitors scheduled in the men\u2019s game this year \u2013 West Indies, Australia, Pakistan and Ireland \u2013 each with scheduling issues to consider should fixtures need moving, while England\u2019s women are due to host South Africa and India.\n\u201cWe\u2019re now thinking of all these things, the risks posed, and it just gets bigger and wider,\u201d Elworthy says. \u201cBut if that is the situation we are faced with then we will deliver on absolutely every single one of those to make sure it does happen.\u201d\nThe ECB, at the start of a new \u00a31.1bn rights deal and with cash reserves greatly diminished, is clearly desperate to get cricket back on for its broadcast partners and sponsors, but Elworthy insists the decision to stage matches will not be blinded by the economic need.\n\u201cOne thing you have to consider is the national mood. You might be able to deliver a match but would it be the right thing? Operationally we believe we can deliver anything but we have to have an eye on that. You don\u2019t just operate in a bubble, you need peripheral vision.\n\u201c[And] making sure everyone is in a safe environment is front and centre of the discussions. We have had good conversations with the new chief exec of the Professional Cricketers\u2019 Association, Tony Irish, as well as county directors of cricket. Player and official safety and comfort is paramount.\u201d\nA veteran of six global tournaments stretching back to the 2007 World T20 in South Africa, and awarded an MBE in 2018, Elworthy says the current situation is \u201cwithout a shadow of a doubt\u201d the most challenging he has faced, not least because the start date and length of the 2020 season remain unknown.\nHis team was not totally blindsided, at least, with the subject of a global pandemic arising during contingency planning for last year\u2019s men\u2019s World Cup \u2013 \u201cthe issue of bird flu came up, as an example\u201d \u2013 even though terrorism was considered the greatest threat to the tournament at the time.\nUnlike a global event that has a rigid window in the international calendar, a home summer at least provides scope for flexibility (barring a fully cancelled season). There are, however, four domestic competitions to be staged: the County Championship, the T20 Blast, the One-Day Cup and the Hundred.\nOne or more may be forced to lie fallow for a year as the ECB prioritises the money-spinning white-ball formats but the viability of the Hundred\u2019s inaugural season is about more than its ability to generate cash. Intended to inject fresh impetus into the sport, the 100-ball competition may yet be better served by a 12-month delay given the potential crowd restrictions and loss of overseas stars.\nElworthy, who will oversee its delivery, is not blind to the challenges here but is reluctant to be drawn on its immediate future. \u201cNo one has a crystal ball. We know what the Hundred is intended for and the power of what it can deliver. There will be considerations for all competitions and a process to go through but I would be hesitant to write off anything at this stage.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know when we\u2019ll get the green light to get back on and playing. You must make sure you have done all your critical thinking and planning so when you reach that point and know how much season is left, you deliver as much cricket as possible and as coherently as possible.\n\u201cOne thing you can guarantee is that sport is one of the greatest unifiers. We will come out of this and it will be front and centre of pulling the country together. That\u2019s the power of sport and cricket has a huge role to play in that.\u201d",

The British airline Flybe, previously Europe\u2019s largest regional carrier, collapsed at the start of the month as the coronavirus crisis caused a slump in bookings.\nRafael Schvartzman, Iata\u2019s regional vice-president for Europe, said on Thursday that many airlines did not have enough cash to sustain them through more than two months of shutdowns.\nThe industry this week called for governments around the world to intervene with cash support \u2013 including cash injections, loans and tax reliefs \u2013 to stave off a \u201cliquidity crisis\u201d. Alexandre de Juniac, Iata\u2019s chief executive, said that failure to do so could cause airlines to fail \u201cen masse\u201d.\nUS politicians have responded with a bailout for the industry expected to run to as much as $50bn in loans and cash support.\nIn the UK, the government has so far proven unwilling to give special assistance to the airline industry. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has pledged to pay 80% of the salaries of furloughed workers across the UK, but the government was thought to be against providing special support for airlines, some of which had boasted of strong balance sheets.\nBritish Airways owner, International Airlines Group, this month said it had \u00a38.9bn in cash and loan facilities available, while the budget carrier easyJet continued with a \u00a3171m dividend payout despite the crisis.\nEnvironmental campaigners have also argued airlines should not be bailed out unless they have realistic plans to tackle the climate emergency.",

        "content": "Row over sacking of minister leads to coalition partner pulling out\nA domestic power struggle, disputes over how best to tackle coronavirus and a split between US and European foreign policy have all combined to bring down the government in Kosovo, plunging the country into constitutional chaos just when it should be devising a local response to the pandemic.\nThe government of the prime minister, Albin Kurti, lost a no-confidence vote brought by one of its own coalition partners late on Wednesday evening, by 82 votes to 32, with one abstention. It came after a tempestuous 12-hour debate in parliament.\nIn Kosovo, there was disbelief at the timing of the move. In recent days, residents have taken to banging pots and pans on their balconies to express their disgust at the timing of the political upheaval.\n\u201cPeople are very disappointed and angry about what is going on; they feel it\u2019s very selfish from the parties and leaders who decided to tackle the government at this particular moment, when we all need to address the coronavirus issue,\u201d said Agron Bajrami, the editor-in-chief of Koha Ditore, Kosovo\u2019s biggest daily newspaper.\n\u201cFor the whole day the politicians were busy throwing venom at each other while the medical sector has needs which need to be fulfilled,\u201d he said.\nSo far, there have been 71 confirmed cases of coronavirus in Kosovo, with one death.\nThe political crisis is the culmination of a political battle between Kosovo\u2019s president, Hashim Tha\u00e7i, and Kurti, who was finally installed as prime minister in February after months of political wrangling to create a coalition. His party won the most votes in October elections on a leftwing, anti-corruption platform, but does not have the numbers to govern alone.\nKurti has been involved in a tussle with his coalition partner, the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK) and fired the party\u2019s interior minister last week for not being in line with government coronavirus policy and backing a state of emergency that would give Tha\u00e7i more power.\nThe spat has local origins but has been fuelled by deep divisions between European capitals and US foreign policy, with Donald Trump\u2019s administration keen to see a deal done between Kosovo and Serbia. Belgrade refuses to recognise the independence of its former province, which split off from Serbia after a bloody crackdown from Belgrade triggered Nato bombing campaign in 1999.\nThe White House has been pushing for a deal between Belgrade and Pristina to be inked this year, in what would be seen as a triumph of diplomacy for Trump. While Tha\u00e7i has been amenable to US moves, Kurti was more sceptical, worried that a deal would involve making too many concessions to Serbia.\nThe European Union has also been pursuing negotiations towards a deal that would eventually allow accession for both countries, but has been moving on a slower timetable and is more wary of any deal that would involve a territorial exchange.\nThese tensions came to the surface ahead of the no-confidence vote, as European capitals reacted with horror to the vote of no confidence even as the US ambassador was egging it on.\nThe French and German ambassadors sent a terse note to the LDK on Tuesday asking it \u201cto reconsider the no-confidence vote and maintain trusted and stable government to face challenges\u201d. However, hours later, the US ambassador, Philip Kosnett, wrote on Twitter that he was \u201cpleased\u201d the vote would take place.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never had a transatlantic split or the west speaking in different voices,\u201d said Agon Maliqi, a political analyst.\nThe timing is particularly unfortunate. The battle against coronavirus in the country has already been hampered by tussles between the president and prime minister, resulting in confusing mixed messages being transmitted to the population. On Monday evening, Kurti\u2019s government announced a double curfew, giving people just two four-hour windows during which they would be allowed to leave their homes each day.\nTha\u00e7i, however, criticised the rules as unconstitutional and called on people to ignore them. \u201cCitizens are not obliged to respect this decision. Neither the police nor the security authorities should enforce this decision of the government,\u201d he said.\nThe next steps are unclear: Kosovo\u2019s constitution calls for elections within 45 days, which would seem to be impossible during a pandemic. The other option is for the president to invite the leader of the biggest party to govern, which is Kurti.\nIn a message posted on Facebook on Thursday lunchtime, Kurti vowed his government would continue in a caretaker role and slammed Tha\u00e7i and Richard Grenell, the US ambassador to Germany who has been the point man for White House attempts to strike a Kosovo-Serbia deal.\nHe said the vote had proceeded after a \u201csignal\u201d from Grenell, and showed that \u201cthere are over 80 MPs in Kosovo ready to risk the lives of citizens only to back a presidential [land] exchange.\u201d",

Under the scheme, announced on Tuesday, volunteers will offer help to 1.5 million vulnerable people with underlying health conditions who are most at risk from the coronavirus.\n\u201cIt helps you to feel like you can do something positive, because you feel overwhelmed,\u201d Hinchliffe said. \u201cThere\u2019s so many sad stories, so you want to do what you can to relieve the burden on the NHS. I\u2019m willing to do anything that\u2019s required.\u201d\nApplicants have not yet been told if they have been accepted or what they will be doing. Jobs will include delivering medicines from pharmacies, driving patients to GP appointments or hospital, and making regular phone calls to check on people at risk of loneliness.\nJack Hattersley, 22, from Langley Park in Durham, said he saw no reason why he shouldn\u2019t volunteer. \u201cPeople need help \u2013 that\u2019s really the crux of it,\u201d he said. \u201cBoth my parents are key workers \u2013 Mum works at a primary school and Dad is a transport manager for Asda. They\u2019re doing their thing and I don\u2019t see why I shouldn\u2019t.\n\u201cWith all three of us out and about it is only a matter of time before one of us gets it and then we\u2019ll all have to self-isolate. So I have to help as much as possible while I can.\u201d\nHattersley, a student at the University of Kent, was waiting to be verified; it was likely to be up to 72 hours before he heard back. \u201cI signed up as a community response volunteer and NHS transport volunteer. The north-east will most likely be one of the worst-hit areas in the UK. The poorly funded area and lack of transport there means the only way of overcoming the virus is if we all band together,\u201d he said.\nHattersley and his family have been taking precautions at home. \u201cWe have developed a system of taking off clothes, immediately putting them in the wash and having a shower when we get home.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cI don\u2019t have any concerns at all. It\u2019s the lack of equipment that will be the biggest worry to me and other volunteers. My only issue is accidentally passing it on to others.\u201d\nThe scheme will match up volunteers with local healthcare professionals when they need assistance. This sense of community, and the ability to help those nearby, has been a pull for many people.\n\u201cMy parents live about an hour and a half away, and a month before the coronavirus outbreak my dad was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, so he suddenly became one of the most vulnerable in the country,\u201d said Sarah Goodenough, 48, in Suffolk.\n\u201cThey\u2019re not on the doorstep, so I feel so helpless. I\u2019m telling my mum to use the volunteers nearby, so I think I need to be giving back and helping someone in my community.\u201d\nShamyla, who lives in London and has just turned 18, has decided to volunteer with the NHS now that her A-levels have been cancelled. \u201cThe past few months I\u2019ve been coming home and revising, and waking up and revising, and that\u2019s all gone, so we\u2019re left with nothing to do.\u201d she said.\n\u201cI used to volunteer at a hospital in London last year, where I helped out with mealtime support workers and helped in the stockrooms every week. Now I want to get involved with visiting people, going out and getting supplies, or having a chat with people who are in self-isolation to make them feel less lonely.\u201d\nJohn Berry, 60, who has retired from the army\u2019s physical training corps after 35 years of service, said he would like to help in any way possible. \u201cI\u2019ve signed up to be a driver, to deliver food or medical supplies and to help those who are vulnerable,\u201d he said.\nBerry, who lives in the West Midlands, said it was important to help those who were struggling. \u201cI was expecting to hear back but I heard that the government has been inundated with volunteers, which is great news as it shows what we can do as a country when we come together.\u201d\nGuy Champniss, a behavioural scientist, also thought the volunteering scheme could have some psychological benefits for participants. \u201cIt\u2019s a time of particularly drastic measures, and it\u2019s difficult to accept that the vast majority of what we do for a living suddenly falls away and is completely irrelevant,\u201d he said.\n\u201cLots of people are curious to keep learning and changing careers because we want more meaning. It makes you question how much meaning your work has if you\u2019re simply a bystander, which is what most of us have been reduced to.\n\u201cEven just applying and going through, that action has been positive,\u201d he added. \u201cA lot of behavioural science says that first small step is the critical one, so I feel like now I\u2019m facing in the right direction.\u201d",

It predicts that maintaining the restrictions until April would delay a second peak until October, which would relieve pressure on health services in the intervening months.\nThe study serves as a reminder that there is no quick and easy exit strategy from the lockdowns that many countries have imposed.\nThe models the study uses are not directly applicable to other countries, but the overall conclusion probably applies everywhere, the researchers say.\n\u201cPhysical distancing measures are very useful and we need to carefully adjust their lifting to avoid subsequent waves of infection when workers and schoolchildren return to their normal routine,\u201d said Yang Liu, a research fellow at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and co-author of the study. \u201cIf those waves come too quickly, that could overwhelm health systems.\u201d\nThe study is in line with documents published by the UK government\u2019s scientific advisory group for emergencies (Sage), which state that physical distancing measures could need to be in place for at least half a year to be effective and will probably need to be relaxed and tightened periodically to reduce the impact of subsequent waves of infection.\nUsing the latest data on the spread of Covid-19 in Wuhan and the rest of China, the study analysed different scenarios for lifting the intense control measures introduced in Wuhan in mid-January. Schools have been closed ever since and only about 10% of the workforce \u2013 roughly corresponding to healthcare workers, police and other essential government staff \u2013 have been at work.\nThe study found that physical distancing measures were likely to be most effective if a staggered return to work were to start at the beginning of April, potentially reducing the median number of new infections by 24% up to the end of 2020 and delaying a second peak until October.\nKiesha Prem, also of the London School of Hygiene and the lead author, said: \u201cThe unprecedented measures the city of Wuhan has put in place to reduce social contacts in school and the workplace have helped to control the outbreak. However, the city now needs to be really careful to avoid prematurely lifting physical distancing measures, because that could lead to an earlier secondary peak in cases. But if they relax the restrictions gradually, this is likely to both delay and flatten the peak.\u201d\nThe study team used mathematical modelling to simulate the impact of extending or relaxing physical distancing measures in Wuhan.\nTim Colbourn, an epidemiologist from University College London who was not involved in the study, said the findings had crucial implications for policymakers, and country-specific models could help governments to calculate how to ease restrictions over time.\n\u201cGiven many countries with mounting epidemics now potentially face the first phase of lockdown, safe ways out of the situation must be identified,\u201d he said.",

The figure is the highest ever reported, beating the previous record of 695,000 claims filed the week ending 2 October 1982.\nThe release offers the first official glimpse of the severe economic downturn that the US faces as companies shutter businesses and states across the country move to prevent people from gathering in crowds in an attempt to contain the virus.\nUS Treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin has predicted unemployment in the US \u2013 close to record lows only last month \u2013 could reach 20%. The Trump administration is pushing through a $2tn stimulus package that includes payments to taxpayers as well as bailouts for hard-hit industries to mitigate Covid-19\u2019s impact. But the money will not head off a huge surge in unemployment.\nNearly every state cited the impact of Covid-19, the labor department said. Service industries broadly, particularly accommodation and food services, were hard hit although states also cited healthcare and social assistance, arts, entertainment and recreation, transportation and warehousing, and manufacturing industries.\n\u201cThis morning\u2019s jobless claims confirm that the United States is in the thralls of a catastrophic unemployment crisis, the likes of which we haven\u2019t seen since the Great Depression,\u201d said Andrew Stettner, senior fellow at the Century Foundation thinktank. \u201cThis represents the single worst one-day piece of labor market news in America\u2019s history.\u201d\nAcross the US, laid-off workers have overwhelmed state labor departments with claims for unemployment benefits. In New York City, which now accounts for roughly 5% of global Covid-19 cases, there has been a 1,000% increase in claims.\nTaylor Cox, a 29-year-old bartender from Indianapolis, was laid off 12 days ago. \u201cPeople are scared, people don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. The idea of a tipped worker going without tips for eight weeks or more is one of the most frightening things to have to confront,\u201d told the Guardian.\nAhead of the labor department release, the Trump administration pushed to block states from releasing daily figures on the soaring unemployment crisis.\nOhio and South Carolina stopped releasing daily figures after receiving a memo from the department of labor that read: \u201cThe data from these reports is monitored closely by policy makers and financial markets to determine appropriate actions in light of fast-changing economic conditions. As such, the data must remain embargoed until the national claims report is released the following Thursday at 8.30am.\u201d\nAccording to Johns Hopkins University there are now 55,233 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the US and 802 reported deaths, up from 302 last weekend. Despite the rising casualties, president Donald Trump said this week that he would like the country \u201copened up and just raring to go by Easter\u201d.\nTrump is concerned the quarantine measures could prove more harmful than the virus, an opinion that is disputed by economists and health experts. On Wednesday he tweeted: \u201cThe real people want to get back to work ASAP. We will be stronger than ever before!\u201d\nThe LameStream Media is the dominant force in trying to get me to keep our Country closed as long as possible in the hope that it will be detrimental to my election success. The real people want to get back to work ASAP.  We will be stronger than ever before!\nLast week\u2019s sharp rise in unemployment marks the end of an historic period of US jobs growth. US employers have added jobs every month for 101 consecutive months and in March the unemployment rate was 3.5%, a 50-year low.\nEconomists said it was still too early to gauge the depth and length of the pandemic\u2019s impact on the jobs market. The Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis president, James Bullard, has said he expects unemployment to hit 30% in the second quarter, while Morgan Stanley has estimated that unemployment would average 12.8% over that time period.\n\u201cThere is going to be a lot of hardship for a lot of people,\u201d said Gus Faucher, chief economist of the PNC Financial Services Group.

Yet while Swedes, Germans and Bulgarians still walk more or less freely around their cities, Italians, Spaniards and French people can\u2019t leave their homes. Swedish kids are still going to school, while most of their European peers are not. Shops are open in the Netherlands, Denmark and Hungary but closed elsewhere.\nHow can we make sense of these conflicting realities when European citizens are all equally affected by the virus? How do we achieve the same aim: the containment of the disease in a shared continent, supposedly without borders, with such a range of different policies?\nFor the vast majority of European citizens this emergency comes as close to an experience of war as they are likely to have. And as huge numbers of them look to the EU for protection and joint solutions, Brussels looks helpless.\nUrsula von der Leyen, the European commission president, delivered a reprimand to member governments for their failure to pull together on Thursday. Too many, she said, had selfishly \u201clooked out for themselves\u201d, restricting exports of medical supplies to other EU countries and closing borders.\nThe EU itself can\u2019t do much about a pandemic. It can\u2019t close schools, suspend football matches or lock down European cities. It can\u2019t even close borders to curb the spread of the virus. Only its member governments can. And closing borders is what some governments have done \u2013 against WHO advice \u2013 suspending the Schengen passport-free travel zone for the first time.\nWhat the EU can do is to mitigate the socioeconomic impact of the pandemic, by offering its countries flexibility over EU deficit and state aid rules. Indeed, that\u2019s what it has done: in addition to a \u20ac37bn (\u00a333.7bn) investment fund to counter the effects of Covid-19 on the economy across the continent, it has launched a joint procurement operation covering, ventilators, masks and other vital medical equipment needed across the continent. EU leaders are also setting up a new permanent European crisis management centre.\nYet there is more EU governments could do jointly to reassure their 500 million citizens at a time when their common destiny as a community has never looked so real.\nDespite the inherent limits of the union, the 27 EU health ministers could decide \u2013 on a voluntary basis \u2013 to pool their sovereign emergency powers. They could start coordinating \u2013 not necessarily harmonising \u2013 on data collection (currently there are three different sources), testing (there is no single approach nor central database), as well as containment, quarantine and social distancing . The most obvious benefit of such an EU-wide methodological effort would be to render national comparisons suddenly meaningful.\nThe other useful step would be to stop thinking purely in terms of the unitary state and instead think regionally. As the coronavirus outbreak concentrates in regions and infections don\u2019t spread equally within each country\u2019s territory, health containment measures would no longer be designed along jurisdictional lines but regional ones.\nThis would work even when regional boundaries cut across national borders, such as the whole Basque territory, which crosses the Franco-Spanish border. Measures devised at this level would inherently be more tailored to the local circumstances, proportionate to the declared goals, and potentially better at preserving freedoms for the affected populations.\nA regional approach would also have the merit of fostering healthcare cooperation and solidarity across the territory of the union. It is happening already in a small-scale way: hospitals in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Germany, are treating critically ill coronavirus patients from the neighbouring Alsace region in France, which is struggling to cope. And a small number of Covid patients from Bergamo in Italy have been transferred to Leipzig after authorities in Saxony stepped in to help.\nGiven the different timing of the spread of the virus, a cross-border approach to hospital treatment could represent a game-changer. A coordinated EU-wide response would help to close the gap between the politics of the pandemic at national level and the harsh health realities on the ground.\nBut there is more.\nThe lack of a coherent EU-wide response to the pandemic is undermining one of the most extraordinary achievements of EU cooperation: the Schengen area has allowed people to move about freely without passports since the mid-1990s.\nBut border controls have now been brought back by 12 of the 26 countries in the system. Although these controls offer no major health gain \u2014 but rather slow the free movement of key workers and supplies that might be urgently needed in this emergency \u2014 they are inevitable when member states lack any coordinated containment action plan.\nA coordinated EU-wide response would make these border restrictions unnecessary. What is more, containment measures would have more impact if they were the result of shared expert advice, shared perspectives and a much broader public debate than they currently receive in individual states.\nMost of the measures precipitously implemented at national level are exceptionally restrictive of individual and collective freedoms. As emergency powers are deployed daily to govern the coronavirus pandemic across the continent, there\u2019s a real risk that their exercise may be used to erode not only free movement rights, but also civil rights, and ultimately democracy.\nThe EU \u2013 as an ultimate guarantor of the rule of law \u2013 should not only oversee but also prevent these many repressive measures from infringing citizens\u2019 civil liberties, or, as in the case of Hungary, weakening institutions, under the auspices of tackling the corona crisis.\nUltimately, the European handling of Covid-19 has revealed an uncomfortable truth. Given the high level of socio-economic interdependence in Europe, nation-state solutions can do more harm than good, by offering an illusion of security and safety.\nIt does not have to be this way. As each national approach against Covid-19 entails different trade-offs, and those spill over to other countries, there is a moral \u2014 albeit not yet legal \u2014 argument for our national leaders to work together within the European Union to coordinate their public health interventions as a matter of urgency and to do so within the law.\nThis ongoing health emergency is a rare chance to demonstrate that the EU not only matters, but can also protect us, both from the virus and from our respective governments.",

Everything is slower.\u201d\nScott Henderson, who studies esports at Staffordshire University, feels he\u2019s missing out on valuable experience. \u201cA big part of what we were doing this year was running a live event and we obviously can\u2019t go forward with that,\u201d he says.\nAlthough UK university learning has been moving online for a while in light of the coronavirus crisis, this wasn\u2019t the experience most envisaged. For others, though, it was their first choice. We asked online learners and tutors for their tips on how to make it work.\nAlthough you may be competing with others in your household, try to mark out a work space. \u201cEven if this is temporary each time you use it, place some physical objects around you to customise it. Make it comfortable,\u201d says Martin Weller, professor of educational technology at the Open University. Set boundaries with others. If your study space is now the kitchen table, try to get an agreement that it is yours alone for a set time period.\nIt\u2019s hard to be disciplined to work at home, and even harder if the place is cluttered. \u201cIf you have piles of dishes or laundry around you it can be difficult to focus. I like to set a timer for 15 minutes and do a quick blitz of a room. It makes for a calmer environment,\u201d says Kimberley Lowe, who studied Spanish and English at the Open University.\nAlthough you may miss campus and socialising in person, reaching out and connecting with staff and other students can maintain a sense of community. Use the online systems to maintain social contact. Stephane Bignoux, senior lecturer in management at Middlesex University, says although it can feel lonely, posting on discussion boards and reading other student\u2019s posts can help. Set up informal discussions via Skype or FaceTime if you can.\nNot everyone has access to a laptop and reliable wifi. Some students are relying on mobile data to connect to their online lessons and many are missing physical resources such as the library and laboratories. Get in touch with your university if you don\u2019t have access to the right equipment. \u201cWe are telling staff to make content easy to view and interact with on smartphones. It needs to be much more inclusive,\u201d says Neil Morris, dean of digital education at the University of Leeds.\nRecognise that different tasks require different levels of concentration. Watching a video can be easier than reading a complex text and taking notes. Divide your work in to manageable time slots and take proper breaks.\nThe fact that you can put off watching recorded lectures until later can be dangerous. Make sure you devote your full attention to the recording \u2013 don\u2019t squeeze it in while eating or listening to music. Set a routine to use time efficiently, says Jack Yarrow, 28, a final year engineering student at the Open University. \u201cIf you\u2019re tired or not feeling great don\u2019t just sit there \u2013 go tidy up, and when you\u2019re feeling more awake, apply yourself then.\u201d\nAs with other social media platforms, a simple misunderstanding in writing can quickly escalate. \u201cWhat may have been intended as an ironic comment can be misinterpreted,\u201d warns Weller.\nOn discussion forums you may find that some who don\u2019t speak up in class have more to say \u2013 which is a good thing. \u201cMy course generally don\u2019t interact that much in lectures, but the interaction with online teaching has been constant,\u201d says Evans. \u201cIt seems hiding behind the screen brings out confidence in our generation.\u201d",

I am therefore appalled by reports of police officers and other frontline workers being deliberately coughed at by people claiming to have Covid-19.\n\u201cLet me be very clear: this is a crime and needs to stop. The CPS stands behind emergency and essential workers and will not hesitate to prosecute anybody who threatens them as they go about their vital duties.\u201d\nOn Wednesday Darren Rafferty, 45, admitted to three counts of assaulting an emergency worker after claiming to have coronavirus and directing coughs at Metropolitan police officers arresting him for another offence. He will sentenced at Snaresbrook crown court next week.\nAnother man, David Mott, 40, was jailed on Wednesday after threatening to spit at police officers in Blackburn who had asked him what he was doing out with two others following the government\u2019s announcement of stricter physical distancing rules on Monday night.\nAppearing at Blackburn magistrates court, Mott admitted possession of an offensive weapon, possession of a class B drug and threatening behaviour. He was jailed for 26 weeks.\nLeanne Honess-Heather, an RSPCA officer, said she was approached by five boys aged between 16 and 17 as she tried to help a stranded swan at Rush Lyvars fishing lake in Hullon Saturday. She said they abused her after she asked them to step back.\n\u201cThey seemed to take offence to this, which led to two of the group spitting directly into my face, going in my mouth and eyes, as they yelled \u2018have corona bitch\u2019 at me,\u201d she said.\nStricter guidance strengthening the CPS\u2019s approach to assaults on emergency workers was published in January after analysis revealed it had prosecuted almost 20,000 cases in the first year in which attacks on emergency workers were made a specific offence.\nPolice chiefs said on Tuesday that the coronavirus pandemic could \u201cbring out the worst in humanity\u201d after a spate of opportunistic crimes hindered efforts to control the crisis. The theft of oxygen canisters from a hospital in south Manchester, the puncturing of ambulance tyres and the raiding of food banks by thieves were among the \u201cworrying isolated incidents\u201d in recent days raised by the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council (NPCC).\nOn Sunday morning, paramedics who arrived at a vehicle preparation centre in Ramsgate, Kent, found holes had been drilled into the tyres of six ambulances. Later the same day a West Yorkshire police officer claimed on Twitter that she and her colleagues had been faced with crowds \u201cspitting on the floor and coughing at us\u201d, and had been pelted with eggs, as they responded to a serious incident.\nOn Monday three teenagers were arrested after an elderly couple were allegedly coughed at and assaulted in Hertfordshire.

But, again, when they went on the Ryanair website as a new customer, they found the same flight for \u00a352, almost half the price.\nThe Guardian found that Ryanair priced every flight at \u20ac135.99 from Dublin to London Luton over an entire year when the flight change portal was used. However, the same flights were available for as little as \u20ac17.99 when a new booking was made.\nRyanair has so far not responded to requests for comment.\nEarlier this month the Foreign Office banned all but essential international travel from the UK, but airlines have been making it almost impossible to get a refund even after the airline cancelled their flight.\nAll flights on EU carriers within, or into the EU, and all flights leaving from an EU airport, are protected by the EU\u2019s \u201cdenied boarding\u201d rules, which require refunds or rerouting when flights are cancelled.\nThe problem for consumers is that enforcing these rights is proving very difficult. The airlines push those with cancelled bookings to their website or app. Refunds are only being processed by customer services, which is now impossible to contact.\nWhich? described Wizz Air\u2019s stance in charging its passengers to switch flights as the \u201cthe worst example we\u2019ve seen\u201d.",

The decision over whether to keep the warehouse open is down to Sports Direct, not the recruitment agencies.\nAn email sent by a Sports Direct spokesman to the Guardian said: \u201cOur overriding concern is and always has been the welfare of all staff working at Shirebrook \u2013 full time employees and agency staff alike \u2013 with a commitment to guaranteeing hours for them all.\n\u201cWe have strictly followed government/WHO guidelines and are continually advising and supporting our entire workforce so these new rules are enforced.\n\u201cFor clarity, when coronavirus hit we were mid-tender with all of our agencies, having had concerns that some of the agencies were not looking after their staff.\n\u201cWe are not downsizing but looking to work with responsible suppliers. This current, awful situation has only further highlighted how unreputable [sic] these agencies are; in some cases we have struggled to enforce that they adhere to government/WHO regulations. As a result we are currently reviewing our contracts.\u201d\nThe spokesman later attempted to recall the email, stating that it had not been approved by Sports Direct\u2019s legal department and that there was now no review.\nThe response came after the company was asked about allegations made in a series of interviews conducted by the Guardian with Sports Direct\u2019s warehouse workers and local campaigners. They alleged that Covid-19 safety standards have been ignored inside the warehouse, while it is also claimed that certain agency workers were being pressured to go to work instead of self-isolating.\nIt was also sent just a day after Sports Direct bowed to government pressure and closed all its retail stores, having initially attempted to remain open, claiming it was providing an essential service in helping people keep fit. The company has now volunteered to deliver NHS supplies around the country using its fleet of lorries.\nSeveral other retailers \u2013 including Next, Asos and Topshop \u2013 are continuing to run their online operations while the country is in lockdown.\nOn Thursday, the union Usdaw condemned Sports Direct\u2019s rival JD Sports for \u201cputting lives at risk\u201d and called for its Rochdale warehouse to be temporarily closed. Meanwhile, the fashion retailer Moss Bros has announced it is closing its online operation to protect staff.\nLocal Shirebrook campaigners have been growing increasingly concerned that some Sports Direct workers are being pushed into turning up for work and that the two metre distance rule, designed to lessen the chances of passing on Covid-19, was not being adhered to.\nA letter sent by the union Unite to Sports Direct on Tuesday evening, which has been seen by the Guardian, stated: \u201cWe are being contacted by outside agencies [ie local charities] who are raising real concerns as they have been contacted by employees in desperation who are diabetic and feel that they should be self isolating. It is reported that they have been told that they will be fired immediately if they self isolate.\n\u201cIt is [also] reported that many, many people are still working in close proximity to each other at the warehouse and are being told they are key workers and must stay at work. Additionally reports are coming in that there is very little soap available for hand washing.\u201d\nOne of the agencies said it supplied fewer than 100 workers to the site and that it would \u201cnever pressure anyone to go to work\u201d. The other three agencies did not comment.",

Organisers say people are getting increasingly worried about the Foreign Office\u2019s repatriation efforts.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t panicked up to now, but I am now,\u201d said Ellie Harper, 32, who is stuck five hours from Lima. \u201cWe have had no information about when the next flights are coming, we have heard rumours that they could be next week but this shows the longer this goes on the greater the chances of us being hit by coronavirus and being forced into quarantine for three months.\u201d\nThere have also been reports of poor communication.\nOne couple told a WhatsApp group of marooned Britons on Wednesday night: \u201cWe had a call just now from the British embassy saying we should have been on today\u2019s flight but they never emailed us to say that, and they emailed us yesterday to say we weren\u2019t on the flight and they are now saying it\u2019s too late.\u201d\nDisinfection of street in Cusco outside hostel where Brits and Irish are being quarantined. pic.twitter.com/Sel0YAVic5\nAnother couple in Cusco told how they were selected for the first rescue flight but made it clear to the Foreign Office they were 22 hours away from Lima. When they stood outside their hotel at the allocated time for the pick-up bus, none came.\n\u201cThey then went to the airport in Cusco and there were just two queues \u2013 one of Brazilians and one of Americans all holding certificates for travel and their passports and no sign of any British representatives,\u201d Harper said.\nThe Twitter group #uk&irishstuckinperu tweeted to the British ambassador to Peru, Kate Harrisson: \u201cThis could have been avoided if you had taken the correct action.\u201d\nIt is understood there were 171 passengers, including the most vulnerable, on the first plane, which landed in Heathrow on Thursday morning including between 10 and 20 EU citizens.\nGermany appears to be leading the way on repatriation, with British people stranded in India and Thailand remarking how it has desks at the airports and is actively trying to register its stranded citizens.\nChris Linford, 56, from Hayfield in Derbyshire, said citizens of all nationalities were congregating outside the German embassy in Delhi as it seemed to offer the best hope of leaving India.\nThe cafe owner said: \u201cEvery other country has left. They\u2019ve all been repatriated for free: Russia, Canada, Germans, Bulgarians, Italians,\u201d he said. \u201cAll these foreign nationals are meeting at the German embassy. They [the embassy] are organising all the buses to the airport. It\u2019s all been going through the German embassy.\u201d\nAnother British national got a seat on one of seven coaches charted by the German government to take stranded Europeans from Rishikesh to Delhi five hours away. The woman, who did not want to give her name, stood outside the German embassy on Wednesday pleading for help. She said: \u201cThe British still say call the airline but they [the airline] say call the embassy. Our government is an embarrassment.\u201d\nFigures obtained by the Guardian show Germany has put on 70 charter flights so far to return 17,000 of the 50,000 German nationals stranded from Algeria, Argentina, Cape Verde, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Egypt, Ecuador, the Gambia, Ghana, Guatemala, India, Kenya, Morocco, Mexico, New Zealand, Panama, Peru, the Philippines and Tunisia. Charters are being organised for a further 25 countries.\nThe Foreign Office is waiting for permission for three more flights to get about 1,000 people out of Peru. It is understood there are currently about 12,000 EU nationals in the country, which is under one of the world\u2019s strictest lockdowns with no travel permitted.\nThe Foreign Office has also doubled the number of staff at the call centre in M\u00e1laga through which 90% of the calls to embassies are routed. It will be doubling numbers again in the coming days.\nSources say there are rigorous efforts under way to get six elderly Britons out of Kerala in India, and active work to get others home from countries but efforts are being hampered by lockdowns.\nThe German foreign minister, Heiko Maas, has said the main focus must now be to provide quick and unbureaucratic help.\nThe UK has repatriated just over 1,000 citizens.\nThe foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, told MPs on Monday citizens had been repatriated from 26 countries \u201cas far flung as from Wuhan [China] over to Cuba\u201d.\nClaire Waterton, the mother of a Briton stranded in Ecuador, wrote to Raab this week to complain that the Foreign Office\u2019s advice to keep checking airline websites was \u201cmeaningless\u201d.\n\u201cThis week all German tourists in Ecuador were asked to register their exact locations in the country.

        "content": "World Rugby is drawing up an action plan to ensure leading unions do not go to the wall as the financial impact of coronavirus starts to bite. The governing body is examining the books of all tier one nations, pledging to quickly help the most needy and prioritising the Test calendar which generates the bulk of the sport\u2019s revenue.\nThe Rugby Football Union said this week that it expected to lose up to \u00a350m in the next financial year, Australia will be down \u00a345m if the shutdown continues for the rest of 2020, New Zealand would face a shortfall of \u00a360m, Wales\u2019s loss will be far greater than budgeted for and all the unions have imposed, or are considering, pay cuts. They have all opened up their books for inspection so the extent of the downturn may be gauged. Talks with tier two countries will follow.\nA virtual meeting of World Rugby\u2019s executive committee and professional game committee, which includes representatives from all the major unions, was held on Monday. It agreed that the executive should deliver an action plan as soon as possible. The profit from last year\u2019s World Cup is expected to be \u00a3165m, giving the governing body the means to offer financial support, although no union is in immediate danger of collapsing.\nThe first task is to draw up contingency plans for this year\u2019s two Test windows, in the southern hemisphere in July and Europe in November. Wales are scheduled to play Japan on 27 June and during the following three weekends New Zealand, Australia, South Africa and Argentina all host Six Nations sides, while Italy have matches against the United States and Canada and the Springboks have a fixture against Georgia in Port Elizabeth.\n\u201cWe are intensively examining scenario planning for the July internationals,\u201d said the World Rugby chairman, Bill Beaumont. \u201cWe will be working in full partnership with key stakeholders to explore potential appropriate actions.\n\u201cOnly by working in full partnership with our unions, the professional leagues and international players will we be able to deliver a solution that will reduce the impact of this extraordinary challenge.\u201d\nIt is unlikely to be before the end of next month that World Rugby knows how many, if any, of the tours will go ahead as individual governments will decide on whether visiting teams will be allowed in. Two contingency plans are being considered, the first of which would see the tours postponed until August.\nThe second would alter the nature of the November internationals. Under the current schedule, host unions take all the money generated by a Test, unless it is a fourth international. If there are no matches in the south this summer but Europe enjoyed a full programme, it would ordinarily mean a significant revenue imbalance but World Rugby is looking at a way of sharing the proceeds.\nOne option would be for the teams from the southern hemisphere to host a couple of matches and there is a willingness of the various unions, club organisations and players associations to work together. The RFU and the French Rugby Federation allow only World Rugby to speak directly to their professional clubs over player welfare problems, but that has been lifted to ensure Premiership Rugby and Ligue Nationale de Rugby are part of the dialogue.\nWhile Test rugby will be the priority on resumption, the club matches that will recommence first will be those where no cross-border travel is involved which gives French and English clubs a better chance of completing their leagues than the Pro14.\nLast year, the Six Nations failed to unanimously support World Rugby\u2019s proposal for a nations league that would have been worth \u00a36bn over 12 years and provided insulation in the current crisis. The European Unions turned instead to the private equity company CVC with which they remain in talks over a 15% stake for \u00a3300m, money that would now absorb losses rather than be used for investment.",

        "content": "Seven ships remained off UK coast for unusually long time this month\nNine Royal Navy ships were involved in a major operation shadowing seven Russian vessels who had lingered in the Channel for several days this month as the coronavirus crisis was beginning to worsen in the UK.\nThe unusually high level of Russian activity concluded about a week and a half ago and navy officials said they believed it was primarily a response to western exercises in Europe rather than to a perception that the disease was leaving the UK vulnerable.\nBut it was significant because Russian warships normally transit through the Channel on their way from the Baltic to the Mediterranean or vice versa \u2013 whereas on this occasion they remained off the coast, putting British defences to the test.\nThe seven Russian ships \u2013 two frigates, three corvettes and two landing ships \u2013 were initially tracked by HMS Tyne, an offshore patrol craft. But at various times four navy frigates were deployed to shadow the Russians.\nThe naval activity comes shortly after Russian planes were shadowed by RAF jets west of the British Isles on at least two occasions. Typhoons were scrambled earlier in March to intercept two Russian Tu-142 \u201cBear\u201d bombers north of the Shetland Islands and they followed them as they flew south and west into airspace used by transatlantic commercial airliners.\nMilitary sources believe that the Russians were largely reacting to Operation Cold Response, a major multinational military exercise involving 14,000 troops from nine countries that was due to be conducted in Norway in mid-March and was designed to test the response of western forces to extreme sub-zero conditions.\nThe UK had sent 2,000 troops to take part, but Cold Response was cancelled at the last minute on 11 March in response to the coronavirus outbreak to avoid any unnecessary spread of the disease and to ensure soldiers were available in their home countries as the pandemic crisis developed.\nAt least one of the frigates, HMS Sutherland, was also deployed to monitor the Russians on the way back from the aborted exercise.\nA navy statement said: \u201cThe navy has completed a concentrated operation to shadow the Russian warships after unusually high levels of activity in the English Channel and North Sea.\n\u201cType 23 frigates HMS Kent, HMS Sutherland, HMS Argyll and HMS Richmond joined offshore patrol vessels HMS Tyne and HMS Mersey along with RFA Tideforce, RFA Tidespring and HMS Echo for the large-scale operation with support from Nato allies.\u201d",

A set of boundary plans were voted down by opposition MPs in 2013.\nThere has been criticism in the past that MPs have vested interests in the boundaries of their constituency, as any redrawing of the map can place into their patch new council wards that might typically vote for other parties, making the constituency more or less safe for their own party.\nIn her written statement to the Commons, Smith said: \u201cThis change would provide certainty that the recommendations of the independent boundary commissions \u2013 developed through a robust and impartial process that is open to extensive consultation \u2013 would then be implemented without interference.\u201d\nThe government has now changed the rules so that the new map would be implemented automatically by bringing it to parliament through a mechanism called an order in council.\nThe latest boundary review process, the sixth one to take place since the 1940s, recommended in 2011 that the number of MPs should be reduced from 650 to 600, but the process has been beset with delays. Proposals laid out in 2013 that were backed by the Tories were defeated in parliament.\nThe Boundary Commission released new proposals in 2018 recommending scrapping 32 seats in England, six in Scotland, 11 in Wales and one in Northern Ireland.\nThe boundaries would have scrapped Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Islington North seat and made Boris Johnson\u2019s Uxbridge less safe by bringing in typically Labour-voting wards in Ealing.\nA controversial \u201cDevonwall\u201d seat that crossed the counties of Devon and Cornwall was another unpopular proposal in the now-axed 2018 plan.\nSmith said the decision to abandon plans to reduce the number of MPs from 650 to 600 was sensible in light of changed circumstances.\n\u201cSince that policy was established in the coalition agreement, the United Kingdom has now left the European Union,\u201d she said. \u201cThe UK parliament will have a greater workload now we are taking back control and regaining our political and economic independence. It is therefore sensible for the number of parliamentary constituencies to remain at 650.\u201d",

Yet some people have dealt with the restrictions with impressive creativity.\nThe freestyle skier Andri Ragettli normally spends his time flying over slopes in Switzerland, but this week he has turned his flat into an assault course to work on his technique and balance. Ben Zwiehoff, a cross-country mountain bike racer, has also turned his accommodation into a training centre. Elisha Nochomovitz, a restaurant worker who has to stay at home due to the lockdown in France, popped outside to his balcony to complete a marathon. Nochomovitz was meant to be competing at the Barcelona marathon this month, but had to settle for 3,000 laps of his seven-metre balcony instead.\nFootballers have been keeping shape at home too. Manchester United player Angel Gomes has been practising his shooting by lobbing balls into his bin. Trent Alexander-Arnold has also been keeping his eye in. Although, instead of picking out Andy Robertson on the opposite flank at Anfield, he has been pinging balls at his garden furniture. Sergio Ramos has been on his running machine (with his top off, naturally). David Silva incorporated his kids into his workout regime. Bruno Alves has been doing keep-ups with his chest. And Alexis S\u00e1nchez has been walking his dogs and putting pictures of them on the internet; in a time of great upheaval it is comforting to know that some things never change.\nThe footballer responsible for the most creative training regime has not been a professional but a young goalkeeper called Nathan. The youngster, who is isolating in Ireland, has come up with a drill that does not require any other players. He kicks a ball against his garden wall and then rushes across his goalmouth to make a save before the ball can rebound off the wall and into his net. Juan Mata, the Manchester United midfielder, was so impressed by Nathan that he offered to have a training session together once lockdown restrictions are lifted.\nHow are you keeping fit and active during lockdown?

        "content": "Discovery adds to growing evidence that Neanderthals were very similar to modern humans \nNeanderthals made extensive use of coastal environments, munching on fish, crabs and mussels, researchers have found, in the latest study to reveal similarities between modern humans and our big-browed cousins.\nUntil now, many Neanderthal sites had shown only small-scale use of marine resources; for example, scattered shells. But now archaeologists have excavated a cave on the coast of Portugal and discovered a huge, structured deposit of remains, including from mussels and limpets, dating to between 106,000 and 86,000 years ago.\nResearchers say the discovery shows that Neanderthals systematically collected seafood: in some layers the density of shells was as high as 370kg per cubic metre. They say this is exciting because the use of marine resources on such a scale and in such a way had previously been thought to be a trait of anatomically modern humans.\nProf Jo\u00e3o Zilh\u00e3o, of the University of Barcelona, a co-author of the report, said the discovery added to a growing body of research suggesting modern humans and Neanderthals were very similar.\n\u201cI feel myself uncomfortable with the comparison between Neanderthals and Homo sapiens, because the bottom line is Neanderthals were Homo sapiens too,\u201d he said. \u201cNot only was there extensive interbreeding, and such interbreeding was the norm and not the exception, but also in every single aspect of cognition and behaviour for which we have archaeological evidence, Neanderthals pass the sapiens test with outstanding marks.\u201d\nThe findings chime with recent evidence that Neanderthals had \u201csurfers\u2019 ear\u201d and may have dived to collect shells for use as tools. Previous finds in Spain have shown they decorated seashells and were producing rock art 65,000 years ago.\n\u201cForget about this Hollywood-like image of the Neanderthal as this half-naked primitive that roamed the steppe tundra of northern Europe hunting for mammoths and other megafauna with poor and inefficient weapons,\u201d said Zilh\u00e3o. \u201cThe real Neanderthal is the Neanderthal who is in southern Europe.\u201d\nThe discovery appears to throws cold water on the idea that the marine-rich diet of modern humans, high in fatty acids, helped them to outcompete Neanderthals as a result of better cognition.\n\u201cIf [marine foods] were important to modern humans, then they were important for Neanderthals as well \u2013 or perhaps they did not have the importance people have been attributing to them,\u201d said Zilh\u00e3o, noting that in any case few modern humans were living by the coast.\nWriting in the journal Science, researchers reveal how the newly excavated site, which was about 2km or less from the coast when occupied by Neanderthals, contained a plethora of stone tools, roasted plant matter and remains from horses and deer, as well as from eels, sharks, seals, crabs and waterfowl, suggesting a diverse diet.\nZilh\u00e3o said the find also shed some light on Neanderthal fishing practices, noting that they must have had baskets or bags. \u201cYou cannot walk 2,000m with a catch of 10 or 20 kilos of shells in your hands,\u201d he said, adding that the Neanderthal population also probably understood that shellfish collected at the wrong time could be toxic.\nThe team say the dearth of other huge shell deposits in Europe could be down to a lack of preservation: shellfish could not be transported far from the coast, and hence many such deposits in northern Europe would have been destroyed as polar ice caps advanced, while elsewhere they may have been submerged as the sea rose to today\u2019s levels.\nThe stretch of Portuguese coast where the new find was made is perhaps the only location locally where such deposits could have been preserved, they say. South Africa, by contrast, experienced an uplift of the land, meaning many such deposits have been preserved.\nDr Matthew Pope, a Neanderthal researcher at the UCL Institute of Archaeology who was not involved in the study, said its findings were significant.\n\u201cWe have increasingly recognised the sophistication of Neanderthal behaviour, but one thing that continued to mark out the behavioural evolution of modern humans in Africa was the appearance of systematic collection of marine resources, and this marked a difference between the two populations,\u201d he said. \u201cEvidence like this is important in showing Neanderthal populations had the capability for systematic exploitation of marine resources.\u201d",

        "content": "Andrew Cuomo joins New York City mayor Bill de Blasio in condemning response as state reports more than 37,000 cases\nNew York\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, excoriated Congress on Thursday for failing to provide much-needed aid to his state as it battles a soaring number of fatalities and a continuing scramble for medical supplies.\nThe $2tn coronavirus stimulus package that passed the Senate late on Wednesday woefully neglects New York, according to Cuomo, who said it allocated $5bn in aid to the state, earmarked only for Covid-19 expenses. The funds do nothing to address the $10bn-$15bn in lost revenue New York expects to incur because of the crisis, Cuomo said.\n\u201cThis was the time to put politics aside and partisanship aside,\u201d Cuomo said during a press briefing. \u201cThis is the time for governmental leaders to stop making excuses and just do your job. Do your job.\u201d\nHe was not alone.\nNew York City\u2019s mayor, Bill de Blasio, on Wednesday expressed alarm at the fact that the city has only been promised $1bn in aid through the same bill, even though it accounts for almost a third of coronavirus cases nationwide. He blamed the Republican Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, for the financially crippling oversight.\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand how anybody \u2013 any public servant \u2013 could live with themselves if they deprived the cities in the middle of the biggest crisis since the Great Depression \u2013 deprived us, deprived our state \u2013 of the money we need,\u201d De Blasio said.\nThe bill is the latest battleground between New York officials and the federal government; De Blasio and Cuomo have continually challenged the Trump administration and Congress to do more for their constituents. The contest over funding comes as New York sees an increase in confirmed Covid-19 cases and deaths, and as the state stares down a devastating lack of medical resources that could put lives at risk.\nNew York City reported 280 deaths by Wednesday evening, a leap from 199 deaths tallied earlier in the day, as hospitals were overwhelmed by a \u201ccacophony of coughing\u201d from Covid-19 cases. Across the state, Cuomo reported 37,258 confirmed cases and 385 deaths by Thursday, with more likely to come.\n\u201cThis is the really bad news. The number of deaths is increasing. It\u2019s bad news because people are dying, and that\u2019s the worst news you can have,\u201d Cuomo said.\nHe attributed the rise in fatalities to people who have been on ventilators for long periods of time and never recovered, and he said there were patients who have now been on ventilators for 20 to 30 days.\nThese lifesaving machines that patients with the most severe Covid-19 symptoms rely on have been a stressor for New York, and on Thursday, Cuomo explained why. Not only is there a tremendous dearth \u2013 New York hospitals had only 4,000 ventilators in the system at the beginning of the outbreak and will need 30,000 \u2013 but Covid-19 patients need ventilators for 11 to 21 days on average, so turnarounds are slow.\nTo try to manage need, one Manhattan hospital has already started sharing ventilators between two patients who require similar ventilator settings, according to the New York Times.\nStill, Trump dismissed these realities. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you need 40,000 or 30,000 ventilators,\u201d he said in an interview with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity on Thursday night.\nWhile hospitals experience a tidal wave of Covid-19 patients, they have been mandated to increase their capacity. Under normal circumstances the state only supports 53,000 hospital beds and 3,000 intensive care unit beds, and hospitals are scrambling to supply the 140,000 beds and 40,000 ICU beds that they are projected to need once the outbreak reaches its apex.\nAs Cuomo implores hospitals to exponentially increase their capacity, 40,000 healthcare workers have volunteered with the state\u2019s surge healthcare force to address the pandemic, including students and retirees.\nAddressing reports of severe supply shortages already at Elmhurst hospital in Queens, De Blasio said he had already resupplied the hospital with additional ventilators four times in the past 10 days and today sent over 40 additional ventilators. \u201cIf we have it, it will get to you,\u201d he said at a press conference on Thursday.\nBefore the coronavirus outbreak, New York City had 20,000 hospital beds; De Blasio said he hopes to triple the system\u2019s capacity to 60,000 beds by May. De Blasio said New York was showing the nation how to deal with a crisis. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a helluva challenge, these weeks ahead. But there\u2019s nowhere on earth where people meet a challenge like New York City.\u201d\nMeanwhile, New York\u2019s attorney general, Letitia James, addressed yet another health crisis and dangerous byproduct of the virus: persecution targeting Asian Americans. James created a hotline to report hate crimes and discrimination earlier this week after people started to describe aggressive, racist behavior perpetrated against them in the name of the virus.\n\u201cNo one should live in fear for their life because of who they are, what they look like, or where they come from,\u201d James said in a statement.",

        "content": "The US has charged the Venezuelan president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, and 14 members of his inner circle with drug trafficking, \u201cnarco-terrorism\u201d, corruption and money laundering, and offered a $15m reward for information leading to Maduro\u2019s capture and prosecution.\nUnveiling the indictment, the attorney general, William Barr, said the Venezuelan leadership collaborated with a dissident faction of the former Colombian guerrilla group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or Farc, operating on the Colombian-Venezuelan border, which Barr described as an \u201cextremely violent terrorist organization\u201d.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve obtained the support of the Maduro regime, who is allowing them to use Venezuela as a safe haven from which they can continue to conduct their cocaine trafficking and their armed insurgency,\u201d Barr said.\nAlongside Maduro, Venezuela\u2019s vice-president for the economy, Venezuela\u2019s defence minister, and the supreme court\u2019s chief justice are among the list of 15 current and former officials who have been indicted.\nThe state department announced a reward of $15m for \u201cinformation related to\u201d Maduro, and $10m each for information on Diosdado Cabello, the head of the national constituent assembly, and three others: Hugo Carvajal, former head of Venezuela\u2019s military intelligence, Cl\u00edver Alcal\u00e1, a retired army major general, and Tareck Zaidan El Aissami Maddah, the country\u2019s industry minister.\nIn separate indictments, prosecutors in Miami charged the head of the Venezuelan supreme court, Maikel Moreno, with money laundering. And charges dating back to May 2019 were unsealed in Washington against the defence minister, Gen Vladimir Padrino, accused of permitting planes carrying drugs to transit Venezuelan airspace.\nBarr said that Venezuelan leaders and the Farc faction organised an \u201cair bridge\u201d from a Venezuelan airbase transporting cocaine to Central America and a sea route to the Caribbean.\n\u201cWe estimate that somewhere between 200 and 250 metric tons of cocaine are shipped out of Venezuela by these routes,\u201d Barr said. \u201cThose 250 metric tons equate to 30m lethal doses.\nGeoffrey Berman, US attorney for the southern district of New York said the accused called the operation the \u201ccartel of the suns\u201d.\n\u201cThe name they chose reflects the cartel\u2019s identity and operations,\u201d Berman said. \u201cIt is a direct reference to the sun-shaped stars that Venezuelan military officers wear on their uniforms.\u201d\nBarr said the US would \u201cexplore all options\u201d to put the accused Venezuelan leaders in custody. Almost all of them are still in Venezuela. Carvajal, the former intelligence chief, had been living in Spain but disappeared in November after a Spanish court approved a US request for extradition.\nAnother of the accused, Cl\u00edver Alcal\u00e1, broke from the Maduro camp in 2013 and and has admitted to plotting to overthrow Maduro with a mercenary army based in Colombia.\nReached by the Guardian in the Colombian city of Barranquilla where he still lives, Alcal\u00e1 said he had been mistakenly accused.\n\u201cThe Colombian authorities know where I am. They know I\u2019m at home, and have no plans to run away,\u201d he said. \u201cI support the indictments against the Maduro regime but I\u2019m a false positive. I shouldn\u2019t be included.\u201d\nThe charges portray Venezuelan drug smuggling as a major national security issue. The justice department statement on the indictments said: \u201cMaduro and the other defendants expressly intended to flood the United States with cocaine in order to undermine the health and wellbeing of our nation. Maduro very deliberately deployed cocaine as a weapon.\u201d\nBut US data for 2018, which shows 210 tons of cocaine passing through Venezuela, shows that six times as much passed through Guatemala in the same period.\n\u201cThe evidence they point to against Maduro is thin, which suggests this is more about politics than about drugs,\u201d said Geoff Ramsey, director of the Venezuela programme at the Washington Office on Latin America thinktank.\n\u201cVenezuela\u2019s nowhere close to a primary transit country for US-bound cocaine. If the US government wanted to address the flow of cocaine they\u2019d focus on corruption in places like Honduras and Guatemala \u2013 both governments that the administration has coddled in recent years.\u201d\nThe charges torpedoed efforts to break a standoff between Maduro, supported by Russia and China, and the US-backed opposition leader, Juan Guaid\u00f3.\nOn Thursday afternoon, Tarek William Saab, the prosecutor general and a close ally of Maduro, announced an investigation into Guaid\u00f3, Alcal\u00e1 \u2013 the ex-general also indicted by the US \u2013 and a host of alleged co-conspirators.\n\u201cGuaid\u00f3 and his North American advisers planned to bathe Venezuela in blood,\u201d Saab tweeted following the announcement.\nJust a day earlier, Maduro had extended an olive branch to his opponents because of the Covid-19 crisis.\n\u201cI\u2019m ready to meet with all sectors that want to talk about the coronavirus pandemic,\u201d he said in a televised address on Wednesday.\nBut that offer appeared to have been rescinded following the US charges.\n\u201cFrom the US and Colombia they have conspired and given the order to fill Venezuela with violence,\u201d Maduro tweeted on Thursday morning.\n\u201cNo negotiation is possible now,\u201d said one source close to the US administration and the Venezuelan opposition. \u201cThere aren\u2019t going to be elections, how could there be?\u201d\nDavid Smilde, a Venezuela expert at Tulane University, said it would be \u201ctragic\u201d if the indictments stopped the Maduro government receiving international assistance during the coronavirus epidemic.\nHe also added that the charges would make it harder for the US to force Maduro out.\n\u201cThese indictments seriously increase the exit costs for Maduro, Cabello and Moreno. It is hard to imagine Maduro being willing to do anything other than hunker down knowing he has a price on his head,\u201d Smilde said. \u201cThese moves effectively ensure a longterm deadlock between the US and Venezuela, just as we have seen with Cuba.\u201d\nIt is not the first time the US has indicted an incumbent head of state in Latin America. The Panamanian dictator, Manuel Noriega, was charged with drugs offences in 1988, and a year later, US forces invaded Panama to arrest him.\nIn October last year, the Honduran president, Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez, was named as a co-conspirator in a New York court in which convicted his brother Juan Antonio \u201cTony\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez, in a large-scale drug conspiracy case.\nThe president, who is a close ally of the US administration, was not charged.",

        "content": "China shuts its borders to foreign visitors, and Russia closes all bars and restaurants\nThe Spanish government has defended its response to the coronavirus pandemic as the death rate in the country slowed for the first time in a week, insisting its actions have always been firmly rooted in scientific advice.\nSpain recorded 655 deaths from Covid-19 over the past 24 hours, bringing the total to 4,089, the health ministry said on Thursday. The number of confirmed cases stands at 56,188.\nThe numbers offered a glimmer of hope a day after the country recorded one of the world\u2019s highest single-day death tolls of the pandemic to date at 738, and its total figure eclipsed that of China. The number of cases worldwide passed 500,000 on Thursday.\nSpain\u2019s foreign minister, Arancha Gonz\u00e1lez Laya, acknowledged that some things could have been done differently but said the nationwide \u201cstate of alarm\u201d and lockdown imposed on 14 March was beginning to show results.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an unprecedented [crisis] in both depth and breadth,\u201d she told the Guardian. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen pandemics in the past, we\u2019ve seen Ebola, for example, but it was much more localised. We\u2019ve seen Sars, but it was much more localised. The impacts at a global level were much smaller, and Ebola was concentrated in countries that had extremely weak healthcare facilities and systems.\n\u201cBut here we\u2019re talking about a pandemic that is hitting the most prepared countries in the world hardest.\u201d\nGonz\u00e1lez Laya said governments around the world faced questions about their management of the crisis, but Spain had always based its response \u201cnot on panic, not on feelings, but on science\u201d.\nAsked whether it had not been a huge mistake to let hundreds of thousands of people take part in nationwide marches for International Women\u2019s Day on 8 March, she said the shift in the situation had only become clear the following day.\n\u201cIt was on 9 March, a day later, that scientists told us \u2018oh-oh, things are getting worse, so you should now move into a different level of alert\u2019, which we did.\u201d\nGonz\u00e1lez Laya also pointed out that different EU countries had opted for very different responses to the crisis. \u201cThe day we called for the state of alarm, we had 120 dead \u2026 and yet we declared the state of alarm and our neighbours did not.\n\u201cThe UK, the Netherlands and Sweden decided to take an anchor point that was very different from the Spanish one. They decided in favour of so-called herd immunity.\u201d\nEarlier on Thursday the Spanish parliament approved an extension of the country\u2019s near-total lockdown to 11 April, and the head of its health emergency centre, Fernando Sim\u00f3n, said the latest death toll figures should be read with caution. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if this will be a trend, but to a certain point it does give us a bit of hope,\u201d he said.\nGonz\u00e1lez Laya said further lockdown extensions and more drastic measures could not be ruled out. \u201cWe have done what was required at every moment and we will continue down that path,\u201d she said.\nItaly remains the hardest-hit country, with 7,503 deaths. Its infection rate had slowed for four consecutive days before Thursday, when it rose again.\nOther countries are bracing for a rapid growth in cases, and an estimated 1.7 billion people worldwide have been ordered to remain in their homes.\nIn Hong Kong and Japan there are concerns about a possible new wave of coronavirus cases. The governor of Tokyo, Yuriko Koike, has asked residents to stay at home at all costs to avoid an \u201cexplosion\u201d of infections.\nChina, which was hit by the virus first and now seems to be recovering, announced it was closing its borders to foreign nationals from this weekend and restricting foreign airlines to one route, with no more than one weekly flight. Each Chinese airline is permitted one route to any specific country with no more than one flight per week.\nRussia announced on Thursday it would close all restaurants, bars, parks and non-essential shops, as the number of confirmed cases there rose to 840. Three people have died, according to official data.\nPutin has delayed a vote on constitutional amendments that would allow him to remain in the Kremlin until 2036. He announced that next week would be a national holiday and urged Russians to stay at home. The government has also halted all international air traffic, except for flights repatriating Russian citizens, and ordered the military to build 16 medical centres to treat victims of the virus.\nIn Brazil, the former president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva called for Jair Bolsonaro to resign or be impeached, adding his voice to the criticisms of the current president\u2019s response to the pandemic. The virus has claimed at least 59 lives in Brazil and infected more than 2,500 people, but Bolsonaro has repeatedly dismissed the illness as a fantasy and a media \u201chysteria\u201d.\nThe World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.\nThe UN agency\u00a0advises\u00a0people to:\nMany countries are now enforcing or recommending curfews or lockdowns. Check with your local authorities for up-to-date information about the situation in your area.\u00a0\nIn the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should\u00a0stay at home for at least 7 days.\nIf you live with other people,\u00a0they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.\nThe head of the WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said the time to act had been a month or two ago. \u201cWe squandered the first window of opportunity \u2026 this is a second opportunity, which we should not squander,\u201d he said.\nThe World Trade Organization said the economic downturn and job losses resulting from the pandemic could be worse than the 2008 recession. It said its economists expected \u201ca very sharp decline in trade\u201d.\nThe economist Nouriel Roubini has described the financial shock from the virus as the fastest and deepest in history.\nIn the US, where more than 1,000 people have died and there are more than 55,000 confirmed cases, the Senate passed a $2tn (\u00a31.63tn) emergency relief package, the biggest rescue deal of its kind in the country\u2019s history.\nWhile the bulk of the funds will go to corporations, the bill will expand unemployment insurance and provide up to $1,200 in direct relief for adults, a $367bn fund for small businesses and $130bn for hospitals. A record 3.3 million Americans filed claims for unemployment last week, figures announced on Thursday revealed, as the pandemic shut down large swaths of the economy.\nThe US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, was rebuffed by other G7 members when he argued that the pandemic should be referred to as the \u201cWuhan virus\u201d in a joint statement from the group, CNN reported. Donald Trump has frequently called it \u201cthe Chinese virus\u201d.\nNew York has emerged as a virus hotspot with infections doubling every few days, according to the state governor, Andrew Cuomo. The virus has claimed 280 lives across the state.\nIn other developments, Afghanistan reported five new cases in the last 24 hours, bringing the total to 84, including four members of Nato forces and two foreign diplomats.\nThe UK government said Prince Charles did not get preferential treatment by receiving a coronavirus test before many NHS workers.\nIran\u2019s health ministry said the country\u2019s death toll from the virus had increased by 157 in the last 24 hours to 2,234, according to the semi-official Fars news agency.\nA redeveloped urban park in Lisbon has been transformed into a makeshift drive-thru clinic for five-minute swab tests, according to Reuters.

We need the BBC Red Button service more than ever, says Bill Stephenson\nAs the author of Protecting the People \u2013 The Central Office of Information and the Reshaping of Post-War Britain, 1946-2011, I have been struck by the failure of the government to remain in control of the message regarding Covid-19.\nWhile the nature of the pandemic changes rapidly, the need for essential information and advice remains constant. The Central Office of Information (COI) was responsible for coordinating public information campaigns for over 60 years, covering a myriad of national emergencies, health campaigns and civil defence measures against a possible nuclear attack. In the 1980s, to raise public awareness of the threat posed by Aids, the COI disseminated TV, radio, newspaper, poster and leaflet propaganda. The leaflet \u201cAids. Don\u2019t Die of Ignorance\u201d was delivered to 23 million households. Some people thought the campaign demonised Aids still further by adding to existing levels of fear. But the general consensus among historians is that it was successful in saving lives.\nWhat is needed now is a coordinated and sustained public information campaign that reinforces key messages to shape people\u2019s behaviour and prevent the spread of the virus. Such a campaign should use the internet, but crucially should also employ the more traditional means of communication. Rather than being fronted by politicians, \u201ccelebrities\u201d appealing to different age, gender and ethnic groups could be employed. Similar approaches proved effective in past COI campaigns such as \u201cDon\u2019t Drink and Drive\u201d, anti-smoking campaigns, and the \u201cGreen Cross Code\u201d etc. Coronavirus is of a different magnitude, but the propaganda principles remain the same. Advice that I would offer is: simplicity, repetition, and \u2013 for a British audience \u2013 occasional humour. I am sure that any number of advertising agencies could produce an effective campaign in a short period of time.David WelchEmeritus professor of modern history, University of Kent\n After a petition, the BBC agreed to pause the proposed closure of its Red Button text service to April. This service brings together news in an easily accessible way via TV, and is especially important for people without access to the internet in these very difficult times.

Similarly, before the 2018-19 season clubs had to apply to enter the newly professional top tier and semi-professional Championship. This was to ensure they could meet the financial and logistical demands.\nAttempts are being made to limit the financial damage to clubs, with a decision on the fate of the WSL and Championship seasons to follow further consultation.\nThe cancellation of the leagues from tiers three to seven was made in the \u201cbest interests of the game\u201d and with the primary concern \u201cthe safety and welfare of clubs, players, staff, officials, volunteers and supporters during this unprecedented time\u201d, according to an FA statement. It added: \u201cToday\u2019s steps take into account the financial impact during this uncertain period.\u201d\nSome teams will feel hard done by. Sunderland, who failed to meet the criteria for a place in the Championship in 2018, are 11 points clear at the top of the WNL Northern Division, and Crawley Wasps are nine points ahead of second-placed Watford in the Southern Division.",

        "content": "Latest daily figures show region reported more than a third of UK\u2019s fatal infections\nThe West Midlands has seen another sharp rise in the number of coronavirus-related deaths after emerging as a hotspot for transmissions of the virus earlier this week.\nOf the 115 new deaths reported across the UK in the latest update, 40 were recorded in the West Midlands. That took the total number of deaths across the Midlands to 112.\nEighteen people who died were being treated by the Royal Wolverhampton NHS trust, which has recorded the highest death toll from the virus for any trust in the UK for the second time.\nThere have been 17 deaths in Sandwell and West Birmingham hospitals NHS trust, 16 in University Hospitals Birmingham NHS foundation trust and 11 in the Dudley Group NHS foundation trust so far.\nEarlier this week the government said it was investigating the reasons behind a hotspot emerging in the region. Anecdotal evidence suggested people\u2019s religious convictions and fears of social isolation could be leading to a sharp rise in the number of coronavirus transmissions in the area.\nIn an interview with the Guardian, the Birmingham MP Khalid Mahmood said older Muslim and Sikh people in the area were struggling to adhere to government guidelines about physical distancing because of their religious convictions.\nDespite most religious services being cancelled, some older people were allegedly continuing to attend mosques and gurdwaras to pray, Mahmood said. Another theory suggested panic buying in supermarkets, with people queueing next to each other for hours to pay for their goods, could be contributing to the large cluster.\nWhile NHS England reported 107 new deaths across 30 trusts on Thursday, some of those deaths had reportedly occurred as early as 16 March. The youngest of the new patients was 32 and had an underlying health condition.\nThe figures emerged amid continuing confusion over the number of virus-related deaths after NHS England changed how the data was reported and it emerged that people dying at home of suspected cases were not included.\nNHS England said it was shifting the time period for the daily reporting of deaths because hospitals under pressure were struggling to gather the data in time.\nIt revealed that 107 people died from coronavirus in England, taking the UK-wide figure to 115 over a 24-hour period \u2013 the highest daily toll so far.\nNHS England also belatedly revealed that the unexpectedly low figure of 28 deaths on Tuesday covered only a short period, from 9am to 5pm, dashing hopes that the UK\u2019s curve was flattening.\nIn future, there will be a time lag of almost a day in reporting deaths, which will be published at 2pm and reflect mortality figures for the 24-hour period before 5pm the previous day.\nThe figures include age brackets showing the range of people who have died.\nHowever, some prominent cases do not appear to be reflected in the figures, such as that of Kayla Williams, a 36-year-old mother from Peckham, who died just before paramedics arrived and was recorded by them as a possible Covid-19 case.\nChloe Middleton, the 21-year-old from Buckinghamshire whose family said on Wednesday she died after contracting coronavirus, also does not appear to be recorded in the figures.\nAn NHS England source said the likely cause of people missing from the statistics is that the daily figures only include those who tested positive in hospital.\nThe UK is only testing people for coronavirus in hospital, so people dying at home or in care homes with symptoms of the disease will be missing from the overall figures.\nThe number of omissions are likely to be low at the moment but could increase as the pandemic worsens in the coming weeks.\nA Public Health England spokesman said the overall figures published daily represented all those who had tested positive for coronavirus, and there was no systemic testing of those who had died with symptoms but no confirmed diagnosis.\nAdditional reporting by Pamela Duncan and Niamh McIntyre",

        "content": "The president was slow to address the pandemic that is plunging the US into recession but could an economic bounceback come in time to aid his re-election hopes\nOn the day of Donald Trump\u2019s election, economists predicted calamity.\n\u201cWe are very probably looking at a global recession, with no end in sight,\u201d wrote Paul Krugman, a columnist at the New York Times.\nThe US president and his allies have spent the past three years crowing, mocking Krugman as a prophet of doom. What no one could have predicted is that when the doomsday prophecy came true, it would be the result of a lightning bolt not of Trump\u2019s own making.\nThe scale of the economic devastation wrought by the coronavirus pandemic became clear on Thursday when it emerged that 3.3 million people filed for unemployment insurance last week. It was almost five times the previous record, set in 1982, and by some estimates the jobless figure could reach 12m to 15m before the storm has passed.\nSuddenly the political landscape has changed. A presidential election and races in the Senate and House are set to take place with an economy undergoing both the biggest contraction and the worst surge in unemployment ever seen. In Washington, a city of heroic statues and soaring monuments, the most relevant now is the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial, with its bronze figures huddled in a Great Depression breadline.\nIn the race for the White House, there are some key questions. Will Trump be blamed, justifiably or otherwise, for millions losing their jobs? Or will voters embrace his claim to be a \u201cwartime president\u201d and conclude this is no time to change? Can his likely opponent, Joe Biden, capitalise on his own strengths as a voice of competence and experience, to present himself as the moral leader the nation needs?\nFor Trump, this is personal. As a billionaire businessman, he predicated his entire political identity on his ability to steward the economy by slashing regulations, shredding trade deals and reviving manufacturing towns.\nFor three years he bragged \u201cJOBS JOBS JOBS!\u201d and never missed a chance to tout unemployment figures for the population at large \u2013 just last month, the rate was at a 50-year low of 3.5% \u2013 and African Americans and Latinos in particular. The true picture was more complicated and unevenly distributed, but the central message was: you\u2019ve never had it so good.\nTrump\u2019s other vital sign of virility, the stock market, has been smashed too, nearly all the gains of his presidency wiped out. It was this more than anything, perhaps, that belatedly persuaded him the virus could not simply be wished away.\nIt is therefore no surprise the president is itching to get the economy fired up again. His push for an Easter Sunday deadline may be ethically callous and scientifically ignorant but politically shrewd. It meant that as the apocalyptic jobless figures hit, he could present himself as already working to get it fixed.\nAs time wears on and Trump continues to agitate for an economic restart, he may seek to shift the blame to medical experts and state governors for holding America back. The message, doubtless amplified by Fox News, will be: \u201cLook, I tried, but my hands were tied.\u201d\nTrump is about to sign Congress\u2019s $2.2tn aid package designed to prevent complete economic collapse. His treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, did most of the hard work but the president gets to claim the credit. For Democrats, like all opposition parties in wartime, there is a difficult balance in holding Trump accountable while not appearing to undermine national unity. They also have to work with Republicans to keep the money flowing until there is light at end of the tunnel.\nHenry Olsen, a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center thinktank, wrote in the Washington Post: \u201cWe should know by June if this approach works.\n\u201cIf it does, the number of Covid-19 infections will have plummeted, deaths from the virus will have flatlined, and people will be coming back to work in droves. It could be the biggest V-shaped economic recovery in US history \u2013 the political-economy version of the resuscitation of a patient after an induced coma.\u201d\nOlsen added: \u201cIt\u2019s too early to predict what the political fallout from a successful pirouette would be, but it\u2019s hard to see how it doesn\u2019t at least insulate President Trump from much criticism about the virus\u2019s arrival to begin with. Democrats can say he should have done more, but the fact remains that no other western leader did better to anticipate the onset of the coronavirus.\n\u201cTrump\u2019s critics are not going to change their stripes, but the few people who remain open to persuasion are as likely to credit Trump as to blame him.\u201d\nThis is the best-case scenario for the president: presenting himself, however spuriously, as the man who led America through its greatest crisis since the second world war, early missteps long forgotten. Biden, meanwhile, is struggling to break through the cacophony and to master the internet, his thunder stolen by New York\u2019s Democratic governor, Andrew Cuomo.\nBill Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution thinktank in Washington and former policy adviser to Bill Clinton, said: \u201cMost people believe this kind of crisis plays to Biden\u2019s strengths. Against that, with the people involved in his campaign, he\u2019s not been very effective at showing that strength.\n\u201cThey\u2019re not very innovative. They don\u2019t seem to have a strategy to keep him in the conversation. They seem a little flummoxed by the technology of the situation.\u201d\nThe worst-case scenario for Trump looks very different. If the death toll keeps climbing, big and small businesses are ruined and the economy sinks into 1930s-style wreckage, his early denialism will be played endlessly in election attack ads. His mendacious press briefings will be taken as proof that he could not rise to the challenge and Democrats will be more energised than ever to dispatch him.\nSo far, polls suggest Trump is getting a bump like George W Bush after the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks. A Gallup survey published on Tuesday showed 60% of Americans gave him positive reviews for his handling of the coronavirus outbreak, and his overall approval rating matched the highest point in his presidency, at 49%, included rises among independents and even Democrats.\nBut this was taken before he reversed his reversal and went back to downplaying the virus, and before the unemployment figures delivered an almighty gut punch.\nThere is a long way to go. It is hard to believe that Trump\u2019s impeachment trial ended only last month. In those terms, the November election is still a lifetime away.",

Boats sounded their horns across Bristol harbour, while in Oban the high school pipe band added their skirl to the vote of thanks.\nFrom city centres to genteel suburbs and village high streets, the explosion of gratitude for NHS staff, care workers, pharmacists and supermarket staff was heartfelt and heavy with emotion as the country struggles to absorb the enormous, unprecedented changes of the past weeks.\nAcross Britain, monuments, buildings and bridges turned NHS blue, from London\u2019s Shard to Manchester Central, the Tyne bridge and the SSE Hydro arena in Glasgow.\nThe Council House is lit up blue tonight to show #Nottingham's appreciation for what all NHS workers do all the time, and especially at this time - as well as our council social care workers on the frontline every day \ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude4c #ClapForOurCarers pic.twitter.com/saLbeA7kWj\nIn individual isolated households the sound was amplified by television, and radio stations paused their programming. Some hung handmade banners of thanks out of windows and across porches, others posted footage of their streets online, adding to the sense of collective appreciation.\nThe organiser of the viral campaign, Annemarie Plas, a Dutch woman living in south London, said she was \u201cso grateful\u201d to see what originated as an idea between a few friends reach national proportions. Plas was inspired by similar efforts from her friends and family in the Netherlands, as well as watching footage of people coming together to thank their health professionals in Spain and France.\nThe very emotional moment we heard clapping and cheering from our headquarters in Waterloo.Thank you all! \ud83d\udc9a#clapfornhs #clapforourcarers #NHSHeroes pic.twitter.com/4yLNz4kLaO\nAcross the country, coming together was the theme of the thanks. Amy Thompson, from Upper Wraxall, Wiltshire, said: \u201cDuring this time of isolation it is one of the ways we can collectively show our gratitude and respect to all members of our NHS. Whilst we quarantine in the comfort of our homes they risk their lives to save others. It\u2019s really important to us that they know we want to say thank you.\u201d\nMartin Knight, from Cold Ashton, near Bath, added: \u201cAs a family we wanted to show our appreciation for the Herculean effort that our NHS staff are putting in every single day and night.\n\u201cWe were all slightly overwhelmed when we heard the amount of people either coming back to the NHS or volunteering to help out in any way they can, just amazing. It\u2019s these acts of kindness and bravery that inspire each and every one of us.\u201d\nApplauding in Glasgow\u2019s southside was Pam Duncan-Glancey, a disability rights activists and NHS employee. \u201cI\u2019ve used the NHS more than most, and it\u2019s incredibly important at a time like this to show solidarity. I don\u2019t work in frontline care, but I see the impact that this crisis is having on colleagues and not once have I seen anyone complain.\u201d\nDuncan-Glancy\u2019s own father died suddenly and unexpectedly on Wednesday, and the compassion shown to her family by health service professionals is another reason why she is clapping only 24 hours later. \u201cWe lost my dad yesterday, yet despite being busier than ever, the paramedic in attendance still took the time to make my sister and I a cup of tea and the ambulance service and NHS24 [Scotland\u2019s telephone health service] \u2013 the busiest people on the planet right now \u2013 sent us their condolence\u201d.",

The majority were on the frontline in the badly affected northern regions and contracted the illness at the start of the outbreak when protective equipment was lacking.\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if a storm hit us,\u201d said Roberto Stellini, a doctor of infectious diseases at Poliambulanza hospital in Brescia. \u201cThe problem is that when this storm hit us we were unprepared, perhaps ignoring what might have been the consequences. Some of the dead were doctors who died at the beginning of the emergency, when we knew nothing about this storm. I knew some of them. Now we are more prepared and we continue to fight.\u201d\nNegative-pressure isolation rooms, designed to contain airborne contaminants, are needed to treat coronavirus properly, to protect doctors and medical technicians from contracting the virus from their patients. But doctors say just a small proportion of Covid-19 patients in Italy are hospitalised in negative-pressure rooms, meaning the virus can easily spread.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an ongoing struggle\u2019\u2019, said Giovanna, an anaesthetist at a hospital in Milan. \u201cThere is no time to think about tiredness, because when you look at Covid-19 patients and how they are living with the disease, in solitude, you realise your mother, father or grandfather could be in that bed.\u201d\nAnna, a doctor in Lombardy, said the mental torment worried her more than physical fatigue. \u201cWe are working in a context I never imagined as a doctor,\u201d she said. \u201cBut when you see Covid-19 patients, above all when you see how they die, in complete solitude, then you forget about your own fatigue. Each doctor also has a personal situation of their own. For example, I have not seen my children for five weeks.\u201d\nA study conducted by Chinese doctors and published by the Lancet showed that 70% of health workers on the frontline in Hubei, the province where the Chinese outbreak began, suffered from extreme levels of stress, 50% had depressive orders, 44% had anxiety and 34% insomnia.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t yet have a study of this kind for Italy, but we\u2019re collecting data that indicates the situation is practically similar to that of China,\u201d said David Lazzari, the president of Italy\u2019s order of psychologists.\nAmong the latest casualties were two dentists who died in Brescia, in Lombardy, on Wednesday and Daniela Trezzi, a 34-year-old nurse who killed herself in Monza, also in Lombardy, on Tuesday. Trezzi had been in quarantine since 10 March after testing positive for Covid-19.\nIt is not known why Trezzi killed herself, but the National Federation of Nurse Guilds said in a statement that her colleagues thought she had been experiencing heavy stress over fears of having infected others. \u201cThis terrible episode, unfortunately, is not the first one since the Covid-19 emergency began,\u201d they said.\nA 49-year-old nurse from Jesolo, near Venice, killed herself last week. She had assisted Covid-19 patients at Jesolo civil hospital until she came down with a fever. The nurse was tested for coronavirus but did not receive the result before she died.\nThe overall death toll in Italy grew by 662 to 8,165, the civil protection agency said on Thursday, down from 683 on Wednesday and 743 on Tuesday. The number of new infections had fallen nationally in recent days but rose on Thursday to 4,492, from 3,491 the day before.\nIn Lombardy, 4,861 people have died since the virus emerged there on 21 February.\n\u201cOn day three of the outbreak we had 2,300 calls, on Wednesday we had around 800,\u201d said Fabrizio Canevari, an operations manager at Soreu della Pianura, a safety and first aid service that manages calls to emergency numbers covering the Lombardy provinces of Pavia, Lodi, Mantua and Cremona. \u201cThere has been a progressive slowdown in the emergency calls, which shows the quarantine is working. However, in some areas of the region the situation is still serious.\u201d\nPaulo Baldini, a nurse who answers calls to an emergency line in the Pavia area, said he had been struck by the kindness of people who either had symptoms of Covid-19 or were worried about relatives, despite having to sometimes wait for hours before a call was answered.\n\u201cThey say \u2018sorry to bother you\u2019 and \u2018thank you\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cUsually that wouldn\u2019t be the case in an emergency unit, when you hear of staff being mistreated. But there\u2019s a dignity, humanity and capacity to face the problem without shouting. We\u2019re humans and, like all humans, we take the baggage of pain home with us, but this kindness helps us to carry on.\u201d\nIn the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or emailjo@samaritans.org.

These adverts are not naturally shared by people online and have less engagement so the government thinks it could be a way of drowning out poor information and conspiracy theories.\nAnother example of fake information came from one influential YouTube vlogger who told his followers incorrectly that coronavirus tests did not work and advised drinking hot water and taking hot baths to kill the virus.\nA post by a Facebook user in Australia that said China had developed a vaccine and was withholding it from the world was shared 130,000 times in just over 24 hours.\nPhil Hammond, an NHS doctor and broadcaster, who is also backing the scheme, said: \u201cMisinformation is as dangerous as contaminated water. It causes untold harm and is profoundly disempowering.\u201d",

It would be the lowest number since the depths of the financial crisis in 2009, when 999,460 cars were made in the UK.\nAston Martin, Lotus and McLaren announced on Tuesday the suspension of production at their factories as the UK entered coronavirus lockdown, adding to previous shutdowns from larger producers such as Jaguar Land Rover and Nissan. Every large car production plant in Europe is now closed as governments try to limit the spread of the disease.\nThe SMMT warned that the production hit could be significantly larger than 200,000 vehicles if the shutdowns last longer than a few weeks. A larger fall could potentially rival the weakness of 2009. The preceding low was in 1984.\nThe coronavirus outbreak has added further pressure to a UK car industry that was already struggling with declining sales of diesel cars and the expensive switch to producing electric vehicles.\nAt the same time, significant Brexit uncertainty remains, with the government still publicly committed to reaching a free-trade agreement with the EU by the end of the year.\nMatt Western, the Labour MP whose Warwick and Leamington constituency is in the key West Midlands car-making region, said he feared the combination of Brexit uncertainty and a coronavirus recession could imperil more UK car plants, following a spate of closures.\n\u201cDomestic manufacturers will be saying, \u2018What\u2019s the point of us having a plant here when we\u2019re not selling any cars here\u2019,\u201d he said.\nMike Hawes, the SMMT\u2019s chief executive, said UK production was \u201cfundamentally strong\u201d with production flat in February compared with the previous year. However, those figures \u201creflect the calm before the storm\u201d, he said.\n\u201cWith UK car plants now effectively on national shutdown and many global markets closed, the outlook is of deep concern,\u201d he said. \u201cWe wholeheartedly welcome government\u2019s extraordinary package of emergency support for businesses and workers, but this must get through to businesses now. If we\u2019re to keep this sector alive and in a position to help Britain get back on its feet, we urgently need funding to be released, additional measures to ease pressure on cashflow and clarity on how employment support measures will work.\u201d",

        "content": "Mining magnate took over page two and three of the Australian for his grand scheme. Plus: News Corp journos forced to take leave\nOn Friday the Australian published a double-page advertisement paid for by the mining magnate Clive Palmer, promoting his plan to fund 1m doses of the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine as a possible cure for Covid-19.\nThe bright yellow ad took over pages two and three of the national broadsheet. The former politician had already placed Facebook ads touting his appearance on Sunrise, where he talked up his plan to launch a large-scale manufacturing plant for the drug.\nOne of the ads features his recent appearance on Channel 7, where he was given airtime to sell the same message. pic.twitter.com/tlDVsLnJeI\nBut as Guardian Australia reported on Wednesday, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have not been approved as treatments for Covid-19, and may have potentially severe and even deadly side effects \u2013 including heart failure and toxicity \u2013 if used inappropriately.\nTests for its use in treating the coronoavirus are in their early stages, and the Therapeutic Goods Administration has said it is concerned about shortages of the drug for people who need it for other conditions after an increase in off-label prescribing as a result of the Covid-19 reports.\nA man in Arizona has died from drinking a small amount of a chloroquine phosphate product, after the US president, Donald Trump, touted hydroxychloroquine as possibly \u201cone of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine\u201d.\nThe Australian\u2019s editor-in-chief, Chris Dore, has been approached for comment.\nJournalists at News Corp Australia will be forced to take take leave, even if it\u2019s unpaid, and work a nine-day fortnight to keep the Murdoch empire afloat during the economic downturn. That was the blunt message to staff across the mastheads on Thursday as the business reeled from a collapse in the advertising market and imposed unprecedented conditions on the workforce for the rest of the financial year.\nThe media union has told staff not to agree to anything until emergency talks with management are held. With newspapers already under pressure many are asking if the coronavirus will finally spell the end of some mastheads. One daily non-Murdoch newspaper, the independently owned Sunraysia Daily, will stop publishing on Saturday.\nThe cuts being forced at News Corp are not unique. Southern Cross Austereo, which owns 86 radio stations, including the Triple M and Hit networks, is imposing a 10% pay cut on staff earning more than $68,000 and everyone is taking 10 days\u2019 leave.\nOur advice to all #MEAAmedia members at @newscorpaus is do not make any commitments to management about shorter hours or forced leave until until we have gained more clarity on these measures. We will meet with management next week.\nThe irony is audiences have never been so big and so hungry for news, with News Corp reporting a 48% increase for the Australian and the Daily Telegraph, Herald Sun, the Courier-Mail and the Advertiser last week. Digital subscriptions have also grown by 21%, but not enough to make up for the slump in advertising revenue as travel, entertainment, retail and other major businesses close down.\nAs News Corp\u2019s chief executive, Michael Miller, said in an internal email: \u201cWhile the public are turning to our trusted news brands in huge numbers, falling business confidence is impacting the advertising revenues of all media businesses.\u201d\nAudiences for television news are also booming. Channel Nine reported its highest-rating bulletin since 2015 on Wednesday as 1.26m viewers tuned in at 6pm.\nAlthough the ABC has pressed pause on job cuts during the pandemic, a handful of news and current affairs shows will be affected and some foreign correspondents have been ordered home.\nAt an unprecedented time of plane groundings, border closures and changing policies and restrictions across the world, the decision has been made for me to temporarily return to Australia. I will still be reporting on #PNG and I will be on the first plane back as soon as I\u2019m able\nThe Jakarta, Bangkok and Port Moresby posts have already been vacated for safety reasons, ABC News has confirmed.\nThe National Press Club regular program has stopped and will now be broadcast only \u201cin special circumstances\u201d; the Signal podcast is now Monday, Wednesday and Friday instead of five days a week; the Asia Pacific newsroom has combined Pacific Beat and Pacific Mornings into a single 55-minute Pacific Beat program, seven days a week; the Mix will cease production and move to \u201cbest of\u201d programs from 19 April; and Planet America\u2019s Fireside Chat on Fridays will not air on 10 April or 17 April.\nSo how will News Corp cope with covering the fast-moving Covid-19 crisis with a smaller workforce while everyone takes enforced leave \u2013 including four days at Easter and at least 20 days\u2019 long service leave for those who have it? Well it will print fewer pages and use more syndicated copy dressed up as a special Covid-19 section called \u201cHiberNation\u201d or \u201cthe most significant newspaper content initiative in living memory\u201d.\nAnnouncing \u201cHiberNation\u201d the chairman of the editorial board at News Corp Australia, Peter Blunden, said: \u201cNo story we\u2019ve ever told has been so big, so rapid to evolve or so widespread.\u201d The eight-page section will \u201cprovide practical advice and tips to help Australians with their lives during this crisis health\u201d, as well as TV guides, recipes and puzzles.\nMost drama and reality TV shows have now shut down production, including Nine\u2019s The Block, which was still soldiering on days ago.\nHow \ud83d\ude2bare \ud83d\ude2b they \ud83d\ude2b still \ud83d\ude2bfilming \ud83d\ude2b https://t.co/f9SNljATvI\nA few builders are staying on the job at the Melbourne site, Nine said.\nNetwork Ten\u2019s Neighbours and The Bachelor, and Foxtel\u2019s The Real Housewives of Melbourne, have stopped filming. Neighbours resumed filming\nBut Seven West Media\u2019s rebooted reality show Big Brother is still filming because the cast has been in isolation for weeks. Filming was paused when a crew member had to be tested for coronavirus, but they came back clear.\nBut it\u2019s not all cutbacks. Some news outfits are introducing products to meet demand. Sky News fans will be pleased to know the pay TV outfit is launching a dedicated Sky News Covid-19 channel on Monday on Foxtel Channel 604, featuring press conferences from around the world, live and in-full, as well as in-depth government announcements. It will also be made available free across skynews.com.au and News Corp masthead websites.\nSBS has launched its multilingual coronavirus portal, a dedicated online information hub for multicultural communities to easily access accurate and trusted news and information about Covid-19 in their language.\nThe portal provides one place where the many Australians who speak a language other than English can go to for the latest news and resources across more than 60 languages, produced by SBS Radio and SBS News.\nWe hope our favourite columnists don\u2019t take too much leave because we\u2019ll miss their takes on the news, like this from the Australian\u2019s veteran Canberra commentator Dennis Shanahan.\nWhile many people thought Scott Morrison\u2019s press conferences were confusing, Shanahan was full of praise.\n\u201cScott Morrison\u2019s forthright rhetoric quells public anxiety over coronavirus,\u201d was the headline\u201d on an article which argued the PM was \u201ccutting through\u201d, a view not shared by most commentators.\nBut for much wilder takes you can\u2019t go past former Labor leader Mark Latham and rightwing commentator Prue MacSween who talked about bats on Twitter.\nSo we now know this destructive cataclysmic virus originated from bats.  When is our Govt going to stop listening to greenie bureaucrats and putting all our lives at risk?  We know bats kill with this virus and others. The message is clear: exterminate now @GladysB\nWhile both MacSween and Latham targeted the black creatures of the sky and their role in coronavirus we can\u2019t fathom what they were trying to say.\nA guy eats a bat in Wuhan and now my two sons are without jobs.The lesson is: when humans lose their mastery and control over the animal world, which is what happened in Wuhan wet market, our entire civilisation can suffer.Humans must always put themselves first, animals second\nThe Institute of Public Affairs is also putting in its two cents\u2019 worth about how we should cope the coronavirus, in a new daily email.\nOn Wednesday the executive director of the rightwing thinktank, John Roskam, was not happy with the government\u2019s handouts to the unemployed. \u201cNot all this extra spending has to be new money and debt,\u201d he said. \u201cThere should be a 20% reduction in public service pay until the crisis is over. There needs to be a sense of shared sacrifice from the public service. We have seen a disconnect of bureaucrat elites from the productive economy.\u201d\nThe ABC is working hard on a plan to help educate Australian children at home when schools close down because of the coronavirus \u2013 but is waiting for an official nationwide shutdown to reveal it.\nIn the meantime ABC Kids has released a list of what is already available in terms of free curriculum-linked programs and resources for primary and secondary students and teachers.\nOn ABC iview you can access educational programs including BTN: Classroom, The Storybuilding Tool Kit, Ecomaths, ScienceXplosion, Citizen Code, Numberblocks and English on the Go.\nOnline at ABC Education you can watch 4,000 free videos, interactive resources and fun games mapped to the Australian curriculum across subjects such as English, mathematics, science, history, geography, media literacy, financial literacy, health and physical education and the arts and technologies, including Stem.\nFriday is the last day for some Australian Associated Press journalists and photographers in the first round of redundancies ahead of the probable closure in June.\nLast week management asked some of those scheduled to leave on Friday to stay on for a few weeks after several 11th-hour bids were made to buy the business, but as the economic crisis worsened any hope the wire service could be saved seemed to be evaporating.\nOne last pic with AAP news editor Paul Mulvey. pic.twitter.com/IAb8IPdEfD\nIn a cruel twist, some staffers who were made redundant were asked to stay on last week, only to be told a few days later there was nothing for them after all. Talk about a rollercoaster.\nThe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission finally gave the go-ahead for the country\u2019s two major magazine publishers to merge, but it may have come too late.\nAfter five months the ACCC ruled that merging Bauer Media and Pacific Magazines \u201cwas not likely to substantially lessen competition in relevant markets\u201d despite the similarity between Bauer\u2019s Woman\u2019s Day and Take 5, and Pacific\u2019s New Idea and That\u2019s Life.\nBut the German media giant has not responded to the competition regulator\u2019s announcement, raising doubts that the deal will go ahead.",

The Tokyo Olympics have been postponed to 2021.\nOn Friday, Harness Racing Victoria announced it would resume racing on Saturday after a steward with Harness Racing New South Wales, who officiated a race meeting attended by a number of drivers and trainers from Victoria, returned a negative test result for Covid-19.\nFlat racing in Victoria resumed on Friday after Melbourne jockey Mark Zahra, who caught a flight 15 days ago with a person later diagnosed with Covid-19, also tested negative. Two NSW jockeys who had contact with Zahra also tested negative.\nZahra himself is scheduled to ride again in Bendigo on Sunday.\nThe Racing Victoria chief executive, Giles Thompson, said Zahra\u2019s negative test \u201cpaves the way for racing to resume in Victoria tomorrow and for this we are extremely grateful\u201d.\n\u201cWe are acutely aware of the incredible hardship that many Australians are facing at this time through the loss of their jobs, which is why we are continuing to work so hard to protect the livelihoods of all those within Victorian racing who depend on it,\u201d he said.\nThe Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, is expected to announce stage three lockdowns on Friday and has repeatedly said that people who can stay home must stay home. Andrews previously indicated shutdowns could be expanded to include everything that is not an essential service. Yet the Victorian government has declined to comment on whether racing should shut down.\nThompson said horse racing supports 25,000 direct and indirect jobs in Victoria alone. According to the Australian Skills and Industry Committee, about 11,400 people are employed directly in horse and dog racing in Australia.\nUnlike other sports, racing has animal care requirements which cannot be shut down.\n\u201cIn announcing the resumption of racing, I want to assure the Victorian community that racing will continue to operate under strict biosecurity protocols and where required act decisively, as we did when suspending racing yesterday, should there be any risk to the health of our industry stakeholders and the wider community,\u201d Thompson said.\nFrom midnight on Friday, people involved in the racing industry who cross state borders will have to stay away from a racetrack for 14 days afterwards. Horses will be allowed to cross state borders only with licensed transport companies, and providing no one involved in transport enters a racecourse.\nHarness racing will resume on Saturday, and the Harness Racing Victoria chief executive, Dayle Brown, said he was \u201ccomfortable with the processes employed by [Harness Racing NSW] to investigate this situation\u201d.\nGreyhound racing in Australia will continue until organisers receive health advice telling them to shut down, a spokesman for Greyhound Racing Victoria told Guardian Australia.\nThe spokesman said there were 1,200 meets a year, with the calendar set 12-month in advance, and participants would stick to that.\n\u201cWe continue to race with our distancing policy in place unless advised otherwise,\u201d he said.\nAll three industries have been racing without trackside crowds, reduced the number of people on course to \u201cessential\u201d personnel, and put social distancing rules in place intended to stop person-to-person contact.\nMembers of the horse racing industry have raised animal welfare concerns if meets are suspended, saying that horses need to be fed and exercised, even if the meets are not running.\nThe RSPCA has called on the federal government to declare work that involves caring for animals, including in the racing industries, as essential, to exclude it from any potential lockdowns. It has not called for racing to be allowed to continue.\n\u201cThis includes if and when these facilities are no longer open to the public,\u201d RSCPA chief executive Richard Mussell said. \u201cThere could be disastrous consequences for human health and welfare as well as animal health and welfare, if people are unable to care for, and are forced to abandon, the animals that depend on them for survival.\u201d",

Greg Hunt that \u201cunclear and convoluted\u201d information from governments and a dire lack of equipment is hampering emergency preparations for the pandemic, and may force staff in these non-profit hospitals to make \u201cdifficult decisions\u201d about which patients they can treat.\nAll hospitals across the country are readying themselves for the pandemic\u2019s peak, which, in a worst-case-scenario, could leave Australia\u2019s intensive care units swamped and struggling to meet the influx of seriously-ill Covid-19 patients.\nModelling released by the Medical Journal of Australia suggested the nation\u2019s ICU capacity of 2,200 beds could be exceeded at around 22,000 Covid-19 cases \u201csometime around April 5 if public health measures fail to curb the rate of growth\u201d.\nNEW: Modelling shows Aussie ICUs will be over-capacity by 5 April ... #preprint #openaccess #COVID19 ... \"we may face the same fate as Italy, or worse\" ... https://t.co/Q6yevkwO5L pic.twitter.com/sArNwFaEKG\nAustralia is attempting to double its ICU capacity and dramatically increase stocks of ventilators in preparation, and intensive care experts believe the number of beds can quickly surge to 5,000.\nImportant regional facilities like Wagga Base Hospital are developing plans to double ICU capacity, while in Sydney, the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital has prepared a dedicated and specially-designed Covid-19 intensive care unit.\nTo relieve the pressure, plans are being drawn up for major hotels to be potentially used as wards, and in Victoria, the government is developing plans to convert the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition centre into a hospital and morgue.\nHealth services are also planning how they might make the types of extremely difficult decisions forced on doctors in Italy \u2013 where a shortage of equipment and beds left frontline staff deciding who lived and who died.\nCanberra Health Services, which gave Guardian Australia an insight into its preparations, is developing a plan for how it will make treatment decisions if there are more patients than clinicians or equipment to treat them.\n\u201cClinicians have to make these decisions all the time,\u201d chief executive Bernadette McDonald said.\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t developed that yet, we\u2019re looking at it but we\u2019re very keen to make sure we get the voice of the consumer and carers into our discussions around that.\u201d\nNon-government hospitals are also beginning to enact their emergency preparedness protocols as Covid-19 presentations increase and are expanding their testing capacity to try to reduce the burden on state-run facilities.\nPrivate health insurers have warned that non-government hospitals will need to take spillover from state-run facilities.\nBut a letter seen by the Guardian shows one of the largest grouping of non-government hospitals in the country \u2013 Catholic Healthcare Australia \u2013 has told the health minister it holds \u201cgrave concerns\u201d about convoluted government communications and barriers to accessing stocks of masks and gowns through the national medical stockpile.\n\u201cWe fear if we continue to face these barriers in access to vital supplies, particularly [personal protective equipment], the result will be reduced access to hospital care for the community at a time when access to medical treatment is most critical,\u201d its chief executive, Pat Garcia, wrote.\nCHA represents 80 non-government hospitals that between them have more than 10,000 beds, including 2,700 public beds.\nIts own supply chains of PPE are under immense strain amid the global pandemic, and hospitals are now urgently trying to access equipment stored in the national medical stockpile through state and territory governments.\nThat has caused huge difficulties, because a single hospital organisation that spans state boundaries has to deal with multiple governments.\nIt is complicated further still by \u201cunclear and convoluted\u201d information about access, Garcia said.\nHe urged the government to plan its pandemic response in a way that used government-run and non-government hospitals as \u201cone seamless network in the fight against Covid-19\u201d.\n\u201cYou would be aware that PPE is a vital component of infection control, protecting clinicians and patients from transmitting the virus,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWithout it, clinical staff will need to make difficult decisions about what services they can provide and which patients they can treat.\u201d\nMore broadly, hospitals are preparing by training staff to resuscitate patients while wearing protective equipment, conducting simulations of how to deal with particular types of Covid-19 positive patients, such as women in labour, and ethical planning if the number of patients exceeds available resources.\nAt Canberra Health Services, a taskforce is meeting daily to discuss critical issues \u2013 supplies, logistics, clinical care (particularly emergency department and intensive care) clinical advice, screening and testing.\nDavid Caldicott, an emergency department consultant in a Canberra hospital and a lecturer at the Australian National University medical school, said emergency doctors around the globe were talking regularly about what was happening in each of their countries and different approaches to the crisis.\n\u201cOne of the fundamental rules of disaster response is plan for the worst-case scenario,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe might hope things turn out a certain way but we also have to plan for the possibility they turn out considerably worse. That\u2019s just sensible disaster planning.\u201d\nHe added that Australia\u2019s trajectory would depend on how well the majority of the population adhered to social distancing measures.\n\u201cThe frontline is at your front door,\u201d Caldicott said.",

In recent years, whenever I looked in at the old pond at Cressbrook Mill, I\u2019d see the electric arc of a kingfisher zipping along the water\u2019s edge, like a blue slit in the air\u2019s fabric. It was something to lift the heart, especially on days of trial and doubt. This time: nothing.\nNever mind. There was no shortage of interest: a mandarin duck at the pond\u2019s distant end and a pair of coots bustling along, white faces like Venetian masks, their proud look belying their gleeful abandon when at intervals they ducked under the water. Near my feet was a clump of marsh marigolds, vibrantly yellow and lusciously green. And beside that a sparkling clear torrent that sank from view into a tunnel heading for the old water-powered cotton mill on the other side of the road.\nCotton transformed this quiet corner of Derbyshire. There was no Cressbrook Mill before the 18th century; the name itself only came into being at this time. A local businessman called John Baker, a hosier from nearby Litton, took over the land when it was first enclosed, cleared undergrowth and planted watercress around the stream, peppermint and lavender beds, and, on the hillside above, fruit trees and filberts. The cress did well, and so a place once known as Grassbrook became Cressbrook. Then Baker sold out to Richard Arkwright and cotton took over. The handsome mill that stands here now was built in 1814.\nStaring at the stream below, I became absorbed in the elegance of the tunnel\u2019s stonework, pondering the hours it must have taken, and the sweat. The valley floor here is strewn with such features. You can think of them as fossils, the petrified remains of a lost epoch. Or else like the junk DNA in our genome, made for some other purpose entirely, and now either just along for the ride, or co-opted for fresh purposes, like the new hydroelectric scheme nearby.\nThe coots don\u2019t care, nor do the marigolds. For them, the anxieties and aspirations of past generations are simply niches to exploit: nature, wherever and whenever it can, remaking the worlds we leave behind. And I take comfort in that.",

        "content": "During a press briefing, Donald Trump said the dates for reopening sections of the country were under discussion\nDonald Trump again struggled to reassure a fearful nation on Thursday as it emerged the US now has the highest number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the world.\nNews that America had surpassed virus hotspots China and Italy with 82,404 cases of infection, according to a tracker run by Johns Hopkins University, broke as the president was holding a press conference at the White House.\nHis instinctive response was to question other countries\u2019 statistics. \u201cIt\u2019s a tribute to the amount of testing that we\u2019re doing,\u201d Trump told reporters. \u201cWe\u2019re doing tremendous testing, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019re not able to tell what China is testing or not testing. I think that\u2019s a little hard.\u201d\nTrump later spoke to the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, by telephone and had what he described on Twitter as a \u201cvery good conversation\u201d. The two leaders discussed the coronavirus in \u201cgreat detail\u201d, adding that: \u201cChina has been through much & has developed a strong understanding of the Virus. We are working closely together. Much respect!\u201d\nJust finished a very good conversation with President Xi of China. Discussed in great detail the CoronaVirus that is ravaging large parts of our Planet. China has been through much & has developed a strong understanding of the Virus. We are working closely together. Much respect!\nWhile the US has increased its testing capacity in recent days the process has been flawed and incoherent, and the country still lags behind leaders such as South Korea in terms of the number of tests administered per-capita.\nOn a grim day, the death toll in America surpassed 1,000 and it was revealed that last week 3.3 million people filed for unemployment \u2013 the biggest single-week jump in history. The president has been widely condemned for failing to act fast enough, misjudging the public mood and seeking to blame others rather than taking personal responsibility.\n\u201cIt\u2019s nobody\u2019s fault,\u201d Trump said of the jobless figure. \u201cCertainly not in this country. Nobody\u2019s fault. We got very lucky when we made a decision not to allow people in from China on a very early date. I say that because some people don\u2019t want to accept it, but this was a great decision made by our country, or the numbers that you\u2019re talking about \u2013 we\u2019re a big country \u2013 they\u2019d be far greater, far bigger.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cI heard it could be six million, could be seven million. It\u2019s 3.3 or 3.2, but it\u2019s a lot of jobs, but I think we\u2019ll come back very strong. The sooner we get back to work \u2013 you know, every day we stay out it gets harder to bring it back very quickly, and our people don\u2019t want to stay out \u2026 I think you\u2019ll see a very fast turnaround once we have a victory over the hidden enemy.\u201d\nTrump told the briefing that dates for reopening sections of the country were under discussion but he notably did not refer to Easter \u2013 12 April \u2013 as he has been pushing in recent days.\nCritics have long accused him of lacking compassion, pointing to examples such as when, in 2017, he lobbed paper towels at hurricane survivors in Puerto Rico. On Thursday he was asked about the thousands of restaurants going out of business, causing personal devastation to owners and staff.\n\u201cI understand the restaurant business,\u201d he claimed, describing it as \u201cvery delicate\u201d. He went on: \u201cYou can serve 30 great meals to a person and a family \u2026 one bad meal, 31, and they never come back again. It\u2019s a very tough business.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cIt may not be the same restaurant, it may not be the same ownership, but they\u2019ll all be back.\u201d\nEven as New York hospitals become overwhelmed, with doctors complaining of nightmarish conditions, and cases spike in cities such as New Orleans, Trump continued to talk down the threat from the virus. \u201cMany people have it. I just spoke to two people that had it. They never went to a doctor, they didn\u2019t report it \u2026 The people that actually die, that percentage is much lower than I actually thought.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cThe mortality rate, in my opinion, is way down,\u201d even though experts have warned that this is likely to worsen in the coming weeks.\nIn a tone that again seemed at odds with the gravity of the situation, Trump asked a reporter from Bloomberg News, \u201cHow\u2019s Michael doing, good?\u201d \u2013 a reference to the failed presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg \u2013 and dismissed a state governor who took part in a conference call as a \u201cwise guy\u201d.\nHe also spoke of his plan to speak by phone with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, later on Thursday, claiming they have a \u201cvery good relationship\u201d. The president has repeatedly used the phrase \u201cChinese virus\u201d, angering some in that country.\n\u201cNo, it came from China,\u201d he said, but he added, \u201cif they feel so strongly about it, we\u2019ll see.\u201d\nVice-President Mike Pence and Deborah Birx, response coordinator for the White House coronavirus taskforce, also sought to calm fears about a shortage of ventilators, despite media reports to the contrary.\nBirx said of New York: \u201cTo wake up this morning and look at people talking about creating DNR situations, Do-Not-Resuscitate situations for patients \u2013 there is no situation in the United States right now that warrants that kind of discussion.\u201d\nThere was some silver lining for Trump on Thursday as stocks rallied on Wall Street for that day after a historic $2tn economic rescue package won passage in the Senate. The plan, which is expected to be voted on in the House of Representatives on Friday, would distribute $1,200 per adult and $500 per child.\nJoe Biden, the frontrunner in the Democratic presidential race, said: \u201cThe president is not responsible for the coronavirus, but he bears full responsibility for the slow and uncoordinated response that has exacerbated both the public health and economic impact on our country. The harsh reality is that at least 3 million people now don\u2019t have jobs because our president didn\u2019t do his job when it mattered.\u201d",

Australians coming back from overseas will be asked to sign an isolation declaration card, which will be strictly enforced. Defence force personnel will support state enforcement efforts in terms of people already in home isolation.\nThat means some returning travellers may have to self-isolate for 28 days. If they live in one of the five states and territories in Australia that has introduced state-based border controls, and requires a 14-day self-isolation period for domestic travellers, they will have to self-isolate again for another 14 days upon arrival in their home states.\nThe government is putting together a third stimulus package which would allow businesses to \u201chibernate\u201d during the coronavirus crisis. Morrison said details of the plan to effectively cocoon businesses will be announced in the next few days as part of a third stimulus package which will also include commercial and residential rental assistance.\n\u201cThere are businesses which will have to close their doors,\u201d he said. \u201cSome businesses will find they won\u2019t have the customers to keep going, for various reasons. We want these businesses to effectively go into a hibernation, which means on the other side, the employees come back, the opportunities come back, the economy comes back.\u201d\nNSW is on the brink of announcing new restrictions in which only essential businesses, such as grocery stores, pharmacies, petrol stations and health facilities will remain open and people will be asked to stay in their homes. Victoria is also heading toward stage 3 restrictions, with each state\u2019s timing likely to move according to the local situation.\nThe imminent state measures come as the NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, revealed that there were at least 145 Covid-19 cases that appeared to be due to community transmission, that could not be explained by overseas travel or contact with a person that had travelled. \u201cThe community-to-community transmission is what we\u2019re concerned with. When you have cases that come from overseas, you can monitor them and you have a source,\u201d she said on Friday morning.\nA woman from the NSW Hunter region has been fined by police for twice defying orders to self-isolate after returning from overseas, as authorities across the country begin to police new rules and regulations to prevent the spread of coronavirus. The woman was first issued with a warning, but was later handed a $1,000 on-the-spot fine when police discovered she had left her home again.\nNSW police say they have also issued fines to the operators of a Sydney massage parlour which remained open despite orders to close, and a woman who returned from a holiday in Bali on Saturday. In Queensland, police have conducted about 1,000 compliance checks of people under self-isolation orders. The commissioner said the strategy had been \u201ccommunication and compassion ... because we know the community is going through a tough time\u201d. Victoria police said as of Friday they were also monitoring people who had tested positive for Covid-19.\nProminent advertisements paid for by the former federal politician Clive Palmer which promote a malaria drug as a potential \u201ccure\u201d for Covid-19 have been called \u201cethically immoral\u201d by Prof Peter Collignon, a former World Health Organization adviser who worked on Australia\u2019s response to the Sars virus. The two-page ad in the Australian states the drug, hydroxychloroquine, when combined with another medication could \u201cwipe out the virus in test tubes\u201d. The ad says Palmer had agreed to personally fund the acquisition or manufacture of 1m doses \u201cto ensure all Australians would have access to the drug as soon as possible\u201d. The ad ran despite the Therapeutic Goods Administration [TGA] warning that the drug and its derivatives \u201cpose well-known serious risks to patients\u201d.\nA leading medical ethicist said Queensland was taking a \u201clethal risk\u201d by holding elections on Saturday, as the Australian Medical Association, virologists and others called for them to be postponed because of coronavirus. Local government elections will be held in council areas across the state. Byelections will be held in two key state electorates, Bundamba and Currumbin.\nAbout 570,000 people applied for postal votes before the deadline, but large numbers said they had not received them. The Queensland electoral commission told those people they could vote in person on Saturday and that physical distancing and other precautions would be taken. The NSW government delayed its local government elections, due in September.\nAustralia and other G20 nations have struck a deal to coordinate efforts to tackle the pandemic as they collectively pledged $7.5tn to kickstart the global economy. Morrison joined President Donald Trump and other members of the G20 through a video link-up on Thursday night. In a communique issued after the meeting, Morrison and other leaders described the pandemic as \u201ca powerful reminder of our interconnectedness and vulnerabilities\u201d.\nIn his contribution to the meeting, Morrison is understood to have called for greater assurances that medical supplies and medicines will freely flow to those who need them. The prime minister also urged support for developing and vulnerable nations including Pacific island countries, which have less capacity to deal with any outbreaks.",

        "content": "Articles from conservative groups argue plastic bags are safer for coronavirus than reusable bags, misrepresenting recent studies\nThe fight to ban plastic bags, many of which end up polluting oceans and rivers, has taken a step backward as conservative US think-tanks exploit the fear of Covid-19, campaigners have said.\nArticles warning that reusable tote bags are worse than plastic ones for spreading coronavirus have been linked to major rightwing nonprofits such as the Manhattan Institute, and contain misinformation aimed at defeating or repealing plastic bag bans, said Greenpeace USA.\nThe effort \u201crisks further confusion\u201d amid a global public health crisis, it said.\nRecent studies have found that Covid-19 could be stable on plastic and steel for up to three days, compared with 24 hours for cardboard and four hours for copper. The studies have not examined how long the virus remained on tote bags and there is little scientific evidence comparing reusable bags with plastic.\nLast week a number of US states and cities nevertheless took the decision to roll back plastic bag bans, citing the coronavirus. Maine repealed its ban. The governor of New Hampshire went further by issuing an order banning reusable bags, saying they risk spreading coronavirus. The governor of Massachusetts banned reusable bags and lifted plastic bag bans. And New York state, which implemented its plastic bag ban on 1 March, will delay enforcement until June.\nThe moves follow articles by researchers at the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) \u2013 a libertarian nonprofit instrumental in persuading the Trump administration to abandon the Paris climate agreement \u2013 suggesting reusable grocery bags are riskier than plastic, and in a journal published by the Manhattan Institute suggesting sustainable bags can carry viruses for up to nine days.\nWhile nonprofits are not required to disclose their donors, both have reportedly received money from fossil fuel companies. Among the sponsors for a CEI gala last year were the Charles Koch Institute and the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers association, the New York Times reported.\nGreenpeace USA criticised the Manhattan Institute and the CEI for a series of articles suggesting that reusable bags are a higher risk for transmitting coronavirus than plastic bags, misrepresenting recent research that shows the virus survives at least as long on plastic.\nSuch misinformation is already being used to lobby state legislatures to defeat or repeal plastic bag ban legislation, it said.\nJohn Hocevar, Greenpeace USA\u2019s oceans campaigner, condemned what he described as industry groups that have \u201cseen the crisis as an opportunity to exploit people\u2019s fears around Covid-19 to push their pro-pollution agendas\u201d.\n\u201cEven in the short term, plastic does not inherently make something clean and safe, and we should not confuse corporate public relations with factual medical research,\u201d Hocevar said.\nSimilar moves are under way in Britain, where the environment secretary, George Eustice, has waived the 5p charge on plastic bags for supermarket shoppers online. Eustice said it was a temporary measure aimed at reducing potential cross-infection between delivery workers and those in isolation, and to speed up deliveries.\nPlans to further reduce single-use plastic, under the environment bill, have been put on hold due to Covid-19.\nThe timing of the Welsh government\u2019s plans to restrict single-use plastics is also under review, it told the Guardian.\nIn the US, the misinformation campaign against reusable bags ramped up after two recent studies. The first, from the University of California, published last month in the Journal of Hospital Infection, reported that viruses similar to Covid-19 could remain on plastic for up to nine days. The second, published on 17 March in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that Covid-19 could be stable on plastic for up to three days. The viruses could be inactivated by disinfection. Neither study examined reusable bags.\nHowever, the day after the first study was published, the Plastics Industry Association wrote to the US Department for Health and Human Services, urging the government to make a pronouncement supporting single-use plastic. The association claimed \u201cstudy after study\u201d showed reusable bags to be a health risk. It did not mention the University of California study.\nThen on 12 March, the City Journal, published by the MI, ran an article claiming: \u201cThe \u2018sustainable\u2019 bags that environmentalists and politicians have been so eager to impose on the public \u2026 can sustain the Covid-19 and flu viruses and spread the virus throughout the store.\u201d\nThe piece, headlined \u201cGreening our way to infection\u201d and written by John Tierney, cites unnamed research that Tierney claims showed viruses and bacteria can survive on tote bags for nine days. It offers no evidence to back this claim \u2013 in fact, it links to a study showing viruses can remain on plastic for nine days.\nThe piece also quotes a 2018 study published in the Journal of Environmental Health where researchers found traces of a surrogate virus on surfaces and the hands of shoppers and store staff high enough \u201cto risk transmission\u201d. They recommended in-store hand hygiene and washing reuseable bags. They did not compare the risk of reusable bags with new plastic bags.\nAnother piece by Tierney, with a similar argument, appeared in the New York Post entitled \u201cUsing tote bags instead of plastic could help spread coronavirus\u201d.\nMeanwhile, the Washington Examiner published a piece by Angela Logomasini of the Competitive Enterprise Institute on 18 March, a day after the New England Journal of Medicine study, headlined: \u201cPlastic bag bans aren\u2019t helping us fight against coronavirus\u201d.\nLogomasini quotes the same 2018 study as Tierney, as well as a 2011 study on reusable and plastic bags that looked at bacteria, not viruses, and was partly funded by the American Chemistry Council.\nIvy Schlegel, a researcher at Greenpeace USA, said: \u201cThis is a classic PR tactic. After new studies showing Covid-19 lasts longer on plastic, they have pulled back into their bag of tricks to redeploy old studies, linking them to legitimate public fear of the coronavirus.\u201d\nHocevar said: \u201cThe truth is that we don\u2019t have all of the answers to this Covid-19 emergency yet, and for industry to use this as an opportunity to increase profits for the fossil fuel and plastics sectors is dangerous and irresponsible.\n\u201cWhat we do know is that there is no substitute for strict hygiene. Just because a material is made from single-use plastic does not make it less likely to transmit viral infections during use; in fact, plastic surfaces appear to allow coronaviruses to remain infectious for particularly long periods compared to other materials.\u201d\n\u201cThe decisions we make for our families in this health crisis should be based on science and the advice of medical professionals, not lobbyists for the fossil fuel and plastics industries. Wherever reusables are an option, it is incumbent upon all of us to do our part to protect one another by washing them thoroughly after every use.\u201d\nA spokesperson for the Manhattan Institute said: \u201cA clear reading of Mr Tierney\u2019s City Journal article shows support of his argument by multiple scientific studies on the use of reusable bags in supermarkets. We stand by the integrity of Mr Tierney\u2019s journalism and will continue to publish articles that shed light on various aspects of this pandemic that we are all going through together.\u201d\nIn a response to the Guardian, Logomasini, a senior fellow at the CEI, defended her Washington Examiner article.

        "content": "In the first of a new series of writers recommending hidden gems available to stream, a plea to discover a snappy French crime caper from Roman Gavras\nNetflix was supposed to be the great democratizer. The streaming platform\u2019s most ardent fans have argued in its favor as a level playing field, instantaneously providing a global audience of millions to smaller independent films that would otherwise never reach them. Critics of the service\u2019s business model have posited that dropping little-known films into such a vast library with little-to-no marketing or promotion would damn those titles to an obscurity even more severe. Just one of the cases in point for the latter school of thought: The World Is Yours by Romain Gavras, a sly crime comedy that Netflix acquired for the US after a positive premiere at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival, then allowed to languish for six months before unceremoniously dumping it into the unending sea of content (it\u2019s available on Amazon Prime in the UK). The release hardly made a blip that December, and in the year-and-change since, its reputation hasn\u2019t grown much.\nIt\u2019s a grave injustice that should be easily remedied, seeing as Gavras follows in a popular tradition of roundly, generously enjoyable gangster mischief. There\u2019s a little Scorsese and a little Ritchie in his fleet-footed stylizing, which whisks audiences through a caper and its attendant double-crosses with a roving, restless camera. Gavras comes from the world of music videos (he directed the nine-minute clip for M.I.A.\u2019s Born Free, in which riot troopers carry out a genocide against redheads), and applies many of the same techniques to long-form narrative. But where many talents making that creative migration in the past have hidden behind slow-mo, format changes and other slickness \u2013 \u201clike a music video\u201d still gets the occasional workout as a stock critical diss \u2013 Gavras folds it all into a story with the substance to justify its sumptuous flash.\nKind and merciful, Far\u00e8s (Karim Leklou, his round face perfectly non-threatening) doesn\u2019t belong in the criminal demimonde, and he knows it. He\u2019s finally set up the job that he hopes will provide him with enough seed money to go legit as the chief provider of ice pops to the Maghreb region of north Africa, and to reject the life of ruthlessness foisted on him by his ice-cold mother (Isabelle Adjani). She\u2019s just one of the unstable quantities trifling with Far\u00e8s\u2019s plan, an ensemble including an Illuminati conspiracy-monger, a rage-prone Scotsman, his eight-year-old daughter and a pair of trigger-happy idiots with Tony Montana fantasies that lend the film its title. You know at least part of the drill; no one can be trusted, things go wrong and yet there\u2019s something unexpected and satisfying about who gets to clinch their happy ending, and how.\nA spiky political subtext also sneaks up on a viewer while they\u2019re busy chuckling at the gallows humor. (The aforementioned morons get the bleakest laugh when one imagines killing their boss and retiring in luxury together, then the other immediately envisions the same scenario frame by frame, except he also shoots his partner and keeps the loot for himself.) Much of Far\u00e8s\u2019s scheme hinges on the xenophobia against Muslims and African immigrants currently festering in France and Spain. The climactic heist plays something like a well-told joke, its punchline being that the gang-averse Spanish police can be readily manipulated into action with even the faintest whiff of terrorist activity.\nIn another world, this would be something of an event on the international cinema circuit, between its high-wattage cast (Adjani and co-star Vincent Cassel rank as two of the bigger names in France\u2019s industry) and Gavras\u2019s instinct for crowd-pleasing. He does everything bombastically; he likes musical interludes, whether that\u2019s a karaoke rendition of Toto\u2019s Africa or clutch soundtracking from the of-the-moment electronic virtuoso Jamie xx. His major set pieces \u2013 a boatjacking that ends in flame, a bomb scare at a water park \u2013 have a zest and ambition absent from many film-makers of his relative greenness. It\u2019s just the sort of hidden treasure an adventurous watcher would\u2019ve once picked up at a video store, or wandered into at an arthouse theater. It\u2019s much harder to stumble upon in the endless scroll of the streaming format; until a better system devises itself, we\u2019ll have to pick up the slack of spreading the word.\nThe World Is Yours is available on Netflix in the US and Amazon Prime in the UK",

But working from home is not a privilege everyone has.\nOnly one in four US workers have a job that allows them to work from home according to the American Time Use Survey from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The survey, which was last conducted in 2017-18 asked workers aged 15 and over whether they were able to work from home and just 28% said yes.\nOf course, Covid-19 is likely to change these numbers, as many employers are forced to rethink their business practices completely. However, the survey still gives an insight into who in the US has greater employment flexibility in these difficult times.\nThe industry where workers were most likely to say they could work from home was financial activities (ironically, also the industry where employees are highly likely to have savings to tide them over during a period of employment). Not only did 57% of people who work in finance say that they could work from home, but 47% said they did work from home and were paid for doing so.\nAfter finance, those working in professional and business services were most likely to say they could work from home (53%) followed by information (also 53%). The industries where workers found it most difficult to work from home were leisure and hospitality (just 9% of whom were able to work from home), as well as agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting (11%).\nThe survey also reveals other trends in who can and cannot work from home. Perhaps unsurprisingly, those on the lowest incomes are least likely to be able to work from home \u2013 just 9% of workers who had earnings in the lowest 25th percentile said they could work from home, compared with 62% of workers in the highest 25th percentile. Full-time workers were twice as likely as part-time workers to say that they can work from home.\nWhile 40% of Asian workers could work from home, that rate was 30% for white workers and 20% for black workers. Hispanic workers were half as likely as non-Hispanic workers to be able to work from home (16% compared with 31%).",

This already high figure comes before London hits its peak, with officers and staff missing because they have contracted the virus or are having to self-isolate.\nAbsentee rates for other forces is averaging about 10%, and is predicted to rise to about 25% as the virus spreads in their areas.\nEnforcing the government\u2019s lockdown is adding to pressure on police numbers. Policing a lockdown was not planned for, in the organisation that forces did in the weeks before the crisis started.\nUnder an agreement between the Fire Brigades Union and employers, firefighters have been authorised to drive ambulances to deliver medicines, and retrieve bodies.\nMatt Wrack, the FBU general secretary, said: \u201cMany fear the loss of life in this outbreak could be overwhelming \u2013 and firefighters, who often handle terrible situations and incidents, are ready to step in to assist with body retrieval.\u201d\nIn London, the area worst hit by the virus, retired police and ambulance workers are also being asked to return to work to relieve pressure on the overstretched emergency services.\nBoth the Metropolitan police and the London ambulance service have appealed for former staff to return. The Metropolitan police said its officers were being asked to return for up to six months.\nThe ambulance service tweeted: \u201cWe are asking former members of our team to consider returning, if they can, to support us in helping Londoners in need. We\u2019re particularly keen to hear from former 111 and 999 control room team staff.\u201d\nThe Met commissioner, Cressida Dick, is to write to all officers who retired within the past five years to ask them to rejoin either in a paid or voluntary capacity. Serving officers who are nearing 30 years\u2019 pensionable service are also being asked to delay their retirement.\nWrack said: \u201cWe face a public health crisis unparalleled in our lifetimes. The coronavirus outbreak is now a humanitarian emergency and firefighters rightly want to help their communities.\u201d\nSpeaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, he said: \u201cFirefighters are clearly keen to do whatever they can to help in the situation.\u201d\nWrack added there was a \u201cneed to protect core functions\u201d of the fire service while firefighters may be asked to take on additional roles.\nHe said: \u201cI think this is a huge challenge across public services and also clearly we need to ensure that firefighters and others are protected in terms of personal protective equipment because no one can do their job if their own safety is compromised.\u201d\nIn a statement he added: \u201cFirefighters are fantastic at teamwork, are experienced in driving emergency vehicles and, as a service rooted in the community, may be best placed to deliver essential items to the most vulnerable.\n\u201cFirefighters and control staff have always stepped in when the public has been in danger and this crisis is no different. The strain on all emergency services will be great, but we can and will get through it together.\u201d\nDick said: \u201cDemands on us will grow and vary over the coming weeks but I want people to know and see that the Met is here for them. We must maintain our operational resilience and continue to provide the best possible service to London.\n\u201cI am hopeful that these exceptionally experienced and knowledgeable former colleagues choose to come and be part of our team and support London at this extraordinary time \u2013 either as a re-employed police officer, special constable or a volunteer.\u201d",

        "content": "Air quality in big cities is likely to improve even more in coming weeks, say scientists\nThe nationwide shutdown caused by the coronavirus outbreak has led to big drops in air pollution across the UK\u2019s major cities, new data analysis shows.\nLevels of toxic pollutants were likely to fall even further, scientists said, as traffic remained off the roads but prevailing westerly winds from the Atlantic returned. Current easterly winds are bringing additional pollution from continental Europe to Britain.\nThe data shows drops in tiny particle pollution of a third to a half in London, Birmingham, Bristol and Cardiff, falls of about quarter in Manchester, York and Belfast, with smaller declines in Glasgow and Newcastle. For nitrogen dioxide (NO2) pollution, the data also shows declines of a third to a half in London, Birmingham, Bristol and Cardiff, and drops of 10-20% in the other cities.\nAir quality improvements have been seen in nations around the world from Italy to China, as much transport and industry has ground to a halt. Public health experts have warned that the health damage inflicted on people by longstanding air pollution is likely to increase the death rate from Covid-19.\n\u201cThe air is definitely much healthier,\u201d said Prof James Lee at York University and the National Centre for Atmospheric Science, who analysed the data. \u201c[Tiny particles and NO2] are the two air pollutants that have the biggest health impacts on people.\u201d\n\u201cThese are big changes \u2013 pollution levels are the equivalent at the moment of a holiday, say an Easter Sunday,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think we will see an even starker drop off when the weather changes.\u201d\nThe data comes from background air monitoring stations in cities, sited away from main roads. \u201cWe chose these because that is where people live,\u201d said Lee.\nThe average pollution levels for the six-week period before the onset of coronavirus outbreak around the 10 February were compared with the six weeks after. Lee also compared the period after the outbreak with the average of the same period over the last five years. Both comparisons showed large cuts in pollution.\nThe analysis is preliminary as full calibration of the data takes time, but Lee said it was very clear there had been a significant fall in pollution. The biggest factor is the reduction in road traffic, as other contributors such as gas power station operations, heating for buildings and emissions from farms are unlikely to have changed overall.\nOne pollutant \u2013 ozone \u2013 has risen. This is because chemical interactions in the air normally result in NO2 and small particles reducing ozone levels. So as they have fallen, ozone has risen. But Lee said: \u201cThe ozone increases are small, and it usually doesn\u2019t become a problem until the summer months anyway.\u201d\nSome scientists have suggested that the number of early deaths avoided due to cleaner air might potentially outnumber the deaths from coronavirus. \u201cIt is going to be a very interesting epidemiological study, but they take years to do,\u201d said Lee. He said analysis would be difficult because the health impact of the coronavirus was fast, while that of air pollution was slower, and because older people were most at risk from both factors.\n\u201cThere is no silver lining to the Covid-19 situation,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think it shows we can actually achieve quite a lot without travelling. It shows that if we did work from home more in normal times then we would have an effect on air pollution.\u201d\nLevels of NO2 in most urban areas of the UK have been illegally high since 2010 and many areas have levels of small particles above the limit recommended by the World Health Organization. This pollution is estimated to cause about 110 premature deaths every day.",

In recent days, Spanish health authorities have been urgently distributing almost 650,000 rapid testing kits to frontline medical staff and residential homes for older people.\nSpain, which is the European country most affected by the coronavirus after Italy, has so far recorded more than 56,000 cases of the disease and more than 4,000 deaths.\nHealth workers, who account for about 14% of the country\u2019s coronavirus victims, have complained of a lack of basic protective equipment such as face masks and gowns.",

We don\u2019t want to lose these companies. We don\u2019t want to lose these workers,\u201d Trump said at a White House press conference. Trump said this was going to happen \u201cvery soon\u201d.\nThe policy of returning to normal, nearly all epidemiologists warn, carries a threat of catastrophe: of allowing the virus to spread just as the measures proven to curb it are starting to work.\nSo where did Trump\u2019s U-turn come from?\nAs frequently is the case with Trump\u2019s political ideas, he seems to have been inspired \u2013 at least in part \u2013 by Fox News, and also by thinkpieces popular among conservatives, but often not written by epidemiologists.\nOn Sunday, the Fox News host Steve Hilton railed against the idea of long-term social distancing. Hilton claimed \u201cworking Americans\u201d will be \u201ccrushed\u201d by an indefinite work shutdown. Hilton mused that there could be a situation where \u201cthe cure is worse than the disease\u201d.\nWithin hours, the Fox News message found its intended target. On Sunday evening Trump tweeted, mangling Hilton\u2019s words slightly: \u201cWE CANNOT LET THE CURE BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF.\u201d\nThe idea of sending people back to work and restarting the economy had been floating around last weekend, propagated by two opinion pieces in particular. One was written on Medium. Another, published two days before the Hilton show, was an opinion piece by David Katz, a former director of the Yale-Griffin Prevention Research Center, which was published by the New York Times. Given the reach of the New York Times this piece, headlined Is Our Fight Against Coronavirus Worse Than the Disease?, attracted huge attention.\nIn the piece, Katz argues that those over 60 and those who are immunologically compromised should be \u201cpreferentially protect[ed]\u201d, with focused testing.\n\u201cThis focus on a much smaller portion of the population would allow most of society to return to life as usual and perhaps prevent vast segments of the economy from collapsing,\u201d Katz wrote, adding that then children could return to school and adults return to their jobs.\nIn time, people would develop immunity to the coronavirus, and in the meantime, damage to the economy would be minimized, Katz opined.\nBut as many pointed out, Katz is not an epidemiologist. Instead, he specializes in nutrition advice, and has published a number of dietary books, including The Way to Eat, Cut Your Cholesterol and Stealth Health.\nKatz\u2019s piece was shared widely among conservatives, including by Fox News host and informal Trump adviser Pete Hegseth. The article served as a handy tool for conservatives advancing the argument that the economy shouldn\u2019t be sacrificed for coronavirus containment.\nA group of Yale epidemiologists swiftly wrote a letter to the Times, rebutting Katz\u2019s piece. Others pointed out Katz\u2019s lack of credentials and his links to big industry. He was once paid $3,500 an hour as an expert witness in a Chobani legal case to defend the sugar contained in its yoghurts.\nKatz has received hundreds of thousands of dollars from companies including Hershey\u2019s, Kind Bars, the walnut industry and Quaker Oats. The science journalist Nina Teicholz has written about how in some cases, Katz wrote positive articles about those companies after receiving grants.\n\u201cDr Katz\u2019s efforts on behalf of public health during this pandemic are uncompensated and born from a sense of duty and commitment to public health,\u201d a spokeswoman for Katz told the Guardian. She pointed to a post Katz wrote on LinkedIn following the criticism, where he stresses how damage to the economy is also a massive public health issue.\nYale itself went to lengths to distance itself from Katz. \u201cDavid Katz is not academically affiliated with Yale and has not held an academic appointment here since 2016,\u201d the university posted on Twitter.\nGregg Gonsalves, an assistant professor of epidemiology at the Yale school of public health, said: \u201cYes, the elderly are at risk. But the ability to sequester safely for months on end, in the United States is untenable. We don\u2019t have a social safety net that maybe continental European countries have.\u201d\nHe said: \u201cThe other thing is, low risk doesn\u2019t mean no risk. We don\u2019t know the natural history of the disease well enough to say: \u2018Everybody under 65 is A-OK and ready to go back to work.\u2019\u201d\nKatz\u2019s piece wasn\u2019t the sole inspiration for Trump\u2019s change of mind. The influential Fox News host Laura Ingraham and others eagerly shared a Medium article written by a tech worker named Aaron Ginn over the weekend, which advances some of the same ideas as Katz.\nMedium later took the article down after widespread criticism, including from experts in infectious diseases.\nThe concept of trading off self-isolation for returning to normal to help the economy has also been pushed by Trump\u2019s cabinet including, his economic adviser Larry Kudlow, who on Tuesday told reporters: \u201cPublic health includes economic health.\u201d\nThe arguments advanced by Katz and others, however, are a piece of a movement which could lead to Trump flip-flopping again on the seriousness of the coronavirus \u2013 which could be problematic for all.",

Over 100 years ago there was Dr James Niven, a straight-talking if shy Scot, who as medical officer for Manchester managed to cut the city\u2019s death rate from 24.2 per thousand in 1893 to 13.8 per thousand in 1921 \u2013 thanks to his pioneering insistence on improved sanitation, maternity services, health visiting, infant welfare, smoke abatement, and preventive measures against TB.\nIt was during the Spanish flu outbreak of 1918 that Niven became known beyond Manchester. As a deadly strain of influenza spread across Europe and the rest of the world, it was Niven who pushed a simple \u2013 though unpopular \u2013 health message that kept many more Mancunians alive than inhabitants of other UK cities: close down society as much as possible to stop the spread of the disease.\nIt was a tricky decree in a working-class city that prided itself on the productivity of its factories and mills. But Niven was resolute, publishing a leaflet early on in the crisis saying the sick should \u201cat once\u201d be separated from the healthy for treatment \u201cand they should bear in mind that the risk of a relapse, with dangerous complications, constitute a chief danger of the disease\u201d.\nHe became a regular in the Manchester Guardian, warning readers not to be complacent and giving them a checklist of symptoms to watch out for: a sudden severe headache, pains in the back and limbs, and fever.\nHe warned that \u201cdischarge from nose and mouth should not be allowed to get dry on pocket handkerchiefs\u201d. Infected articles and rooms should be disinfected, he ordered. Anyone who caught the flu must \u201con no account join assemblages of people for at least 10 days after the beginning of the attack, and in severe cases they should remain away from work for at least three weeks\u201d, he said.\nOn 30 November 1918, the Guardian reported that the epidemic had reached its peak in Manchester. One doctor said they were unable to respond to all calls. \u201cWe are only human and cannot do the impossible,\u201d said the medic. \u201cIt is inevitable that some people cannot be attended to at all.\u201d\nThe situation was so bad that Niven and the police\u2019s chief constable met representatives of \u201cplaces of amusement\u201d and told them to ban children under 14 from all performances.\nA further problem was the delay in carrying out burials and the collection of bodies from undertakers\u2019 parlours, which Niven said was \u201ca very unsatisfactory state of affairs\u201d.\nIt was, he said, \u201can imperative necessity that the War Office should send skilled coffin-makers back to the workshops without delay\u201d. He was exasperated that people still wanted fancy funerals, suggesting the situation \u201cmight be relieved by greater simplicity in funeral arrangements, but relatives were insisting on strict observance of custom, with its paraphernalia of hearse, coaches and elaborate oak coffin\u201d.\nThe pressures of the job eventually took their toll on Niven. He drowned in the sea off Douglas on the Isle of Man on 30 September 1925. An inquest recorded he had taken poison and then drowned himself while temporarily insane.\nHis obituary in the Guardian paid tribute to a humble man who wore his intelligence and experience lightly: \u201cHe was not a great talker and had the merit of never \u2018advertising\u2019 \u2013 in fact, in later years especially he seemed to keep somewhat aloof from his colleagues. He had the reserve of the north-eastern Scotsman, and strangers sometimes fancied his manner to be somewhat chilling. But those who knew him best were able to attribute this to a kind of shyness, and no member of his profession who required help from his great experience and sound knowledge ever asked for advice and assistance in vain.\u201d",

        "content": "Since England\u2019s game in Sofia the London-born midfielder has been racially abused by fans, including of his club CSKA Sofia\nWhen Viv Solomon-Otabor stepped off the plane after returning from his first international call-up, his phone would not stop buzzing. The messages were not ones of congratulations for being part of the Nigeria squad that had faced Brazil but about the shocking racism at England\u2019s Euro 2020 qualifier against Bulgaria.\nLondon-born Solomon-Otabor left Birmingham City for CSKA Sofia last summer in search of a new adventure after seven years at St Andrew\u2019s. The midfielder\u2019s early experiences in Bulgaria were enjoyable and the football was going so well he was called up by Nigeria for that friendly in Singapore. Since England\u2019s visit to Sofia last October, however, the 24-year-old\u2019s time in the country has been repeatedly soured by racist abuse, leaving him isolated.\nMonkey chants were aimed at England players, resulting in the game being stopped twice and a large group of home supporters being ejected. Uefa fined Bulgaria \u00a365,000 and forced the national team to play two games behind closed doors (one suspended for two years). Solomon-Otabor has since been targeted by fans of CSKA Sofia and other Bulgarian clubs with monkey chants and via racist messages on social media.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t watch the game but the moment I got off the plane my phone started buzzing,\u201d Solomon-Otabor says. \u201cEveryone was like: \u2018Is this what you go through?\u2019, \u2018You need to come home\u2019, \u2018You need to get out of there\u2019. I was surprised because it\u2019s happened but up until that I had never experienced it; I had never heard it or seen it. When England came, it was just some stupid people. It is just ignorant people who don\u2019t have knowledge or education. I had never experienced it and was never conscious of it.\u201d\nDuring a cup tie at Arda in early December, Solomon-Otabor was the victim of monkey chants from home fans. The stadium announcer called for the abuse to stop, saying the game would otherwise be abandoned. Arda were fined \u20ac18,000. \u201cI was warming up when I was racially abused by the Arda fans, so that was quite difficult,\u201d Solomon-Otabor says. \u201cI keep getting abusive messages, which is not nice. A fan told me to go home and I can\u2019t say the words that he said.\u201d\nSolomon-Otabor spends much of his free time at home in Sofia because of the regularity of the abuse, focusing on training and playing before returning to his flat for the remainder of the day. Although he has not suffered racism while out in the city, Solomon-Otabor does not want to put himself at risk.\n\u201cThe hardest part is that I am alone. I\u2019ve not lived in another country before and not feeling too comfortable when being out because of what happened to me on the pitch. That is the most difficult thing. I tend to just keep to myself and stay at home.\n\u201cI have had no problems on the streets or anything like that. I think it\u2019s just a mental thing; it\u2019s just how it is. In the club everyone is fantastic. It\u2019s a great club with great history. Everyone at the club is proud of it and really respect the club, so it\u2019s massive to them. Everyone is nice and welcoming but there are stupid people who ruin these things, which is not nice for a young boy coming from England. I have never gone through something like this where you do not feel comfortable.\u201d\nSolomon-Otabor feels he has become a target for locals regardless of his attitude or performance. Insults via social media have included being called the N-word and being sent monkey emojis. As a black English player in Bulgaria, it appears he has become the target for those looking to avenge the punishment that followed the Euro 2020 qualifier.\n\u201cI get sent silly, racial messages on Facebook. I try not to look any more. There are ones when they message you, you open the request and see a message and think: \u2018Here we go.\u2019 Now I just block them and move on.\u201d\nCSKA Sofia have offered constant support to Solomon-Otabor. In a statement in December they said: \u201cWe stand firmly behind our football player Viv Solomon-Otabor, who has been attacked and insulted on this basis in our recent matches.\u201d The club, however, were fined \u20ac19,000 at the start of March for their fans racially abusing the Tsarko Sofia midfielder Dylan Bahamboula during a match.\nComing back from Singapore was supposed to be a time of celebration for Solomon-Otabor, having proved his bold decision to head to Bulgaria had paid dividends by earning international recognition. To be part of a group facing Brazil was a career highlight, even if he failed to make it off the bench.\n\u201cIt was surreal to be in the squad and in training. I was very excited and happy but when I got there I knew it was business. I trained and performed well \u2013 it was just unfortunate I didn\u2019t get on the pitch. I assume another opportunity will come. Obviously, seeing world-class players like Neymar and Coutinho, alongside talented youngsters like Jesus and Casemiro, it was a very exciting moment for me personally and a very proud moment for my family.\u201d\nIn Bulgaria, as in most places, things are on hold but Solomon-Otabor is aiming to refocus on football soon enough. \u201cMy hopes now are just to continue working hard to play and to see what happens. I just want to progress and go higher.\u201d",

        "content": "A Guardian analysis finds that at least 10 ships remain at sea \u2013 and four passengers have died while being stranded\nPorts around the globe are turning cruise ships away en masse amid the coronavirus pandemic, leaving thousands of passengers stranded even as some make desperate pleas for help while sickness spreads aboard.\nFour passengers have died aboard one such vessel, the Holland America cruise ship Zaandam, which has been stranded for days after Chile refused to allow the ship to dock in its original destination of San Antonio on 21 March.\nThe Zaandam is one of at least 10 ships around the world \u2013 carrying nearly 10,000 passengers \u2013 still stuck at sea after having been turned away from their destination ports in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic, according to a Guardian analysis. Some of the ships are facing increasingly desperate medical situations.\nHolland America announced Friday that four elderly passengers had died and two others had tested positive for coronavirus, with 138 additional cases of respiratory illness on board; further tests are still being conducted among its 1,243 guests and 586 crew. The Zaandam is carrying hundreds of American, Canadian, Australian and British passengers, and is currently off the coast of Ecuador and seeking permission to dock in Florida.\nThe ship is steaming up the coast of South America, hoping to make it through the Panama Canal and on to the US. But the Florida port, where many of the passengers had planned to disembark on the final leg of the cruise, has refused to confirm that the ship can dock.\nWhile the Zaandam and at least two other ships still carrying passengers at sea have reported outbreaks of coronavirus-like respiratory illness onboard, other ships are being turned away from docking and unloading their passengers even with no signs of illness at all.\nDramatic scenes of coronavirus-stricken cruises, such as the Grand Princess in California and the Diamond Princess in Japan, have become synonymous with the pandemic. The plight of those still adrift highlights how cruise ships have become a kind of pariah of the seas, with cities wary of becoming the next home for a potentially infected vessel.\nOn the Zaandam, which was headed northeast along the coast of Ecuador on Thursday, anxiety was growing.\nPassengers who spoke with the Guardian describe being locked down in the cabins, with three daily meals left on the floor outside their doors. Meanwhile the number of people reporting influenza-like symptoms has almost tripled this week: 56 passengers and 89 crew members, passengers say the ship\u2019s captain has told them. Four elderly passengers reportedly required oxygen.\nBut on Tuesday a port commission in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, delayed approving the Zaandam\u2019s request, with some commissioners arguing the ship should be turned away because it didn\u2019t originate in Florida, and others calling the situation a humanitarian crisis and saying the passengers should be allowed to disembark, according to the Miami Herald.\nAmid the confusion, passengers began an online lobbying campaign to convince Florida officials to allow the boat to dock. \u201cI am a US citizen and longtime Florida resident who is stranded at sea off the coast of South America,\u201d wrote passenger Laura Gabaroni Huergo on Facebook on Wednesday. \u201cSome (Florida) county officials are trying to turn us away and abandon us at sea to fend for ourselves. We need help getting a plan together to dock and return to our lives.\u201d\nHolland America said this week it had dispatched support in the form of another cruise ship, the Rotterdam, carrying 611 extra staff, supplies and coronavirus test kits to meet up with the stricken ship.\nThe company announced Friday that it plans to offload healthy passengers to the Rotterdam, while keeping ill passengers and those who have been exposed to them aboard the Zaandam.\n\u201cPriority for the first guests to transfer will be given to those on Zaandam with inside staterooms and who are over 70,\u201d said the statement from Holland America. \u201cOnce aboard Rotterdam, all guests will continue to remain in their staterooms until disembarkation. Any guests who are currently ill, or in isolation as a close contact, and all crew will remain on Zaandam.\u201d\nThe company\u2019s statement said there are now four doctors and four nurses aboard the Zaandam and two doctors and four nurses on the Rotterdam.\nAs the Rotterdam pulled alongside the Zaandam in darkness Thursday night, passengers exchanged photos and cheered each other on a Facebook group created for the ship.\n\u201cI would have rather had a helicopter, but beggars can\u2019t be choosers,\u201d said one.\nAs of Thursday, the Guardian had identified five ships in the Americas that were unable to unload nearly 6,000 passengers. At least three other ships were having trouble off the coast of Australia, including one which sought urgent medical attention for an outbreak of respiratory illness. Two more ships were trying to get passengers to ports in Italy.\nLori Bessler, a southern California resident whose parents are stuck onboard the Coral Princess, another boat stranded off the coast of Brazil with no reported illness onboard, says she is nonetheless concerned for her family\u2019s health and wellbeing. \u201cMy mom and stepdad are diabetics and \u2026 we\u2019re very concerned about them having enough medication to sustain them,\u201d she told the Guardian.\nThe Coral Princess was due to dock in Buenos Aires on 18 March but is now headed for Florida. So far the cruise ship has only been allowed to disembark passengers from South America; more than a thousand US, Canadian and British citizens, including Bessler\u2019s parents, remain on the ship.\nBessler said she has struggled to get information from either the cruise company or from US government officials. She worries that Florida may become overrun by Covid-19 cases by the time the ship arrives there in two weeks.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a scary situation,\u201d said Bessler, who has been texting with her mom many times a day. \u201cI think they need to be rescued and brought to their homes.\u201d\nThe fast-moving nature of the virus has added to the confusion \u2013 when many passengers left for vacations in early March there were no cases of Covid-19 in South America, so they thought it would be safe to travel.\nBut Ross Klein, a professor at St John\u2019s College in Newfoundland who has written four books on the cruise industry, said companies should have acted weeks earlier to cancel trips and refund customers. He noted that cases of cruise ships being turned away from ports as a result of coronavirus fears began as early as January and escalated in February, with passengers being quarantined on the Emerald Princess in Japan on 3 February.\n\u201cThere is a level of greed on the part of these companies,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to make every penny \u2013 and they make money when people are on the ships.\u201d\nCruise ships are drawing increasing government scrutiny for not doing enough to protect their passengers during this pandemic. In Florida, the attorney general\u2019s office is investigating potentially misleading sales practices, after the Miami New Times obtained leaked emails showing representatives for Norwegian Cruise Lines may have downplayed the coronavirus in sales pitches to passengers, even as the pandemic was disrupting trips. \u201cThe Coronavirus can only survive in cold temperatures, so the Caribbean is a fantastic choice for your next cruise,\u201d said one sales script obtained by the paper.\nDespite Donald Trump\u2019s repeated vows to bail out the cruise ship industry, money for cruise companies was not a part of the $500bn in aid for large employers included in stimulus bill passed by Congress on Wednesday.\nMost of the major cruise operators register their companies in countries such as Panama and Liberia, thereby avoiding most US taxes and labor laws. Thus, the cruise industry\u2019s trade group said on Thursday the companies will not have access to the US aid for large employers, according to the Washington Post.\nMeanwhile a report from the US Centers for Disease Control this week laid the blame on cruise ships for spreading the virus in the crucial early weeks of the outbreak, linking hundreds of cases to the Diamond Princess and Grand Princess.\n\u201cCruise ships are often settings for outbreaks of infectious diseases because of their closed environment, contact between travelers from many countries, and crew transfers between ships,\u201d the CDC report concluded.\nBack aboard the Zaandam, passengers are passing the time however they can. Some chat with other cabins on a Facebook group, others enjoy the free liquor, snap pictures of brown boobies flying outside their windows, or partake in meditation, yoga classes and a daily quiz offered via the ship\u2019s TV. Passengers joke the top quiz prize should be extra face masks or toilet paper, or a chance to get outside and do laps around the promenade deck.\nJamsheed Master, one of the ship\u2019s piano players, wrote on Facebook that he has composed a thousand songs during his confinement.\nBut despite moments of levity, the situation is bleak.\n\u201cI\u2019m safe and healthy right now. Staying confined in my cabin except for the strange ritual of eating meals in the crew mess while maintaining a safe distance from each other,\u201d he wrote on Monday. \u201cI won\u2019t lie: things are looking grim here and I just want to go home. We all do.\u201d",

I wake up early and for a brief nanosecond all is well with the world. Then my mind turns to the nightmares I have consistently experienced for some months now and to the reality of the coronavirus pandemic. Anxiety electrifies me. It\u2019s not just some sense of existential dread, it\u2019s a parasitical physical entity that takes over my entire body.\nMy shoulders and upper arms tingle with fear, there is a ball of dread in my guts and my legs cramp. I am literally immobilised for the best part of an hour. I know I should be getting out of bed, but I am too afraid to do so. Frequently, I close my eyes in a feeble attempt at mindfulness, repeat the serenity prayer \u2013 all those years in Narcotics Anonymous have paid off despite my having no belief in God \u2013 and hope that when I open them again I will somehow have acquired the willpower to get up.\nWhen I have eventually found the courage to get up, I do two sets of 20 press-ups. Partly as a way of staying fit, but mostly as it\u2019s the best way I\u2019ve found of releasing some of the terror-tension in my upper body. I repeat this at least eight times during the remainder of the day. Then breakfast, which is a piece of toast that I have to force myself to eat. At times of high anxiety, my appetite falls away. Still, I should be losing weight. Only after all this do I manage to catch up on the news and go back to my bedroom. At present I can\u2019t face being in my study at home. I feel too alone and unsafe. Bizarrely, having gone through this routine \u2013 though I can still scarcely read more than a page of a book at a time as my concentration levels aren\u2019t up to it \u2013 my mind settles a little and I can start work. Writing gives me, if not a momentary illusion of control, then at least a welcome distraction from my self. Until first thing the following morning \u2026\nSymptoms are defined by the NHS as either:\nNHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should\u00a0stay at home for at least 7 days.\nIf you live with other people,\u00a0they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.\nAfter 14 days, anyone you live with who does not have symptoms can return to their normal routine. But, if anyone in your home gets symptoms, they should stay at home for 7 days from the day their symptoms start.\u00a0Even if it means they're at home for longer than 14 days.\nIf you live with someone who is 70 or over, has a long-term condition, is pregnant or has a weakened immune system, try to find somewhere else for them to stay for 14 days.\nIf you have to stay at home together, try to keep away from each other as much as possible.\nAfter 7 days, if you no longer have a high temperature you can return to your normal routine.\nIf you still have a high temperature, stay at home until your temperature returns to normal.\nIf you still have a cough after 7 days, but your temperature is normal, you do not need to continue staying at home. A cough can last for several weeks after the infection has gone.\nStaying at home means you should:\nYou can use your garden, if you have one. You can also leave the house to exercise \u2013 but stay at least 2 metres away from other people.\nIf you have symptoms of coronavirus, use the\u00a0NHS 111 coronavirus service\u00a0to find out what to do.\nSource:\u00a0NHS England\u00a0on 23 March 2020\nThe government\u2019s decision to bring in a partial lockdown of the country \u2013 unbelievably some of the alt-right libertarian death cult are calling it \u201chouse arrest\u201d \u2013 might have been an unprecedented peacetime contingency plan, but to me it felt entirely normal. The new rules are more or less the same ones I imposed on myself two weeks previously, when I started working from home and not seeing friends and family. It just feels like reality has finally caught up with my own sense of neurosis and anxiety. Which may be deeply worrying for most ordinary people, but is somehow almost reassuring for me. Almost.\nNot that I\u2019m not feeling a profound sense of loss. My children, other family members and friends feel unbearably distant despite the discovery that the phone can also be used as a phone, and I also miss all my Guardian friends \u2013 they are more than colleagues \u2013 with whom I have shared an office in Westminster for more than six years. I\u2019d also like to update you on one battle. Last week I wrote that I was at least looking forward to spending some of the refunds I would be getting on opera tickets already booked \u2013 the companies made a huge error in asking whether you wanted your money back or would donate the total ticket price as a gift; I would happily have donated 20% but there wasn\u2019t that option \u2013 and that my wife was insistent it be put towards mending things around the house that had been broken for years. Well, tough. I went out and bought a pot instead. At times like these, things of beauty win hands down.\nI should be pleased that I am not one of the 1.5 million people who have been advised by the government to self-isolate due to underlying health conditions. But my paranoia levels are now so high, I am worried that I may have been left off the list by accident and that the NHS has forgotten that I once had pneumonia when I was 16 and that I nearly had to have my leg amputated after my knee replacement became infected.\nIt\u2019s also crossed my mind that the government may actually want to have me killed \u2013 sketch writers are probably high on Dominic Cummings\u2019 hit list \u2013 and has deliberately kept me misinformed. Anyway, I\u2019m taking no chances. Nor am I entirely reassured by reports from Spain and Italy that under-60s are getting preferential treatment for ventilators. If anyone knows how to doctor a birth certificate, please get in touch.\nOtherwise I am coping reasonably well, sticking to the rules and cycling up and down the same half-mile hill. I prefer my exercise to be mindless and repetitive, so that suits me fine. The one member of the household to be finding the new restrictions annoying is the dog. Initially he was thrilled to have both my wife and I at home, but now he is getting fed up with being taken for extra walks on the common. He\u2019s also taken to social distancing from us. Normally when we go to bed, he\u2019s the first up the stairs to nab the prime spot on the duvet. Now he\u2019s taken to sleeping at the bottom of the stairs. He needs a bit of me time. It\u2019s come to something when I\u2019m needier than the neediest dog in the world.\nThese are strange times to be a sketchwriter. The only story is coronavirus \u2013 who\u2019d have guessed Brexit could take a back seat so quickly? \u2013 and there is nothing remotely funny about the pandemic. So I\u2019ve often agonised over what tone to take. Most readers who have got in touch seem to think I have got it about right, but there are some who feel I should be less critical and get more behind the government. My feeling is there should always be room for light relief \u2013 I\u2019m using Shakespeare as my role model here \u2013 and that now, more than ever, journalists should be allowed to ask members of the government the tough questions. As such, my sketches have tended not to focus on the measures the prime minister has taken but on the ones he hasn\u2019t.\nI may be more health-anxious than many, but it seemed to me almost inevitable that what was happening in China back in January would be coming to Europe down the line. And yet the government did almost nothing except argue whether Big Ben should bong for Brexit, fail to deal with the floods and take 10 days off over the half-term break. Ministers may have been working flat out for the last three weeks, but if they had started a couple of months earlier we might have had a more coherent plan in place. Not to mention more coronavirus tests, ventilators and protective equipment for NHS workers. There\u2019s also been an undeniable sense of pathos to my sketches.\nBoris has always longed to see himself as the next Churchill, but his response to the coronavirus was initially one of appeasement. He has frequently misjudged the tone of his addresses to the nation and his messages have often been contradictory and confused. Unbelievably, though, his personal ratings appear to be soaring. So what do I know?\nShortly before 8 o\u2019clock last night, my wife and I rather self-consciously opened the front door and went out into the front garden expecting almost no one else to be around. Instead, nearly all our neighbours were out too and the applause for NHS staff \u2013 not to mention the klaxon that came from the balcony of the flats opposite \u2013 was prolonged and deeply moving. It was a wonderful moment of unity and I was only sorry that our next-door neighbour, who is a paramedic, wasn\u2019t also outside to hear how much he was appreciated. I\u2019m guessing he was working.\nPerhaps we should make this kind of thing a regular Thursday night event. We need all the community we can get. With so much terrible news, I\u2019ve started to appreciate the small things all the more. While out walking the dog, my wife pointed to some green shoots that we had passed the day before and had grown just a little more. Stuff I would ordinarily miss but am now training myself to observe. My garden is also coming back to life: I have recently given the lawn its first mow of the year, and almost all my bananas, ferns and architectural plants appear to have survived the winter, though it\u2019s still too early to remove their fleeces. One echium bush, covered with budding blue spiral thingies (a technical term), has already grown far bigger than I expected and really needs moving, except I can\u2019t bear to replant it in case I accidentally kill it.\nBut my real highlight of the coming weekend will be the clocks going forward an hour so that it won\u2019t get dark till 7.30. It\u2019s a yearly milestone that never fails to fill me with hope even at times of deep despair. The extra evening daylight does wonders for my soul and I look forward to celebrating with a Diet Coke out on the patio. Even if it\u2019s raining. In the meantime, may you all stay safe and stay well.\nDigested week, digested: Partial lockdown.",

In a video posted on Twitter, Johnson confirmed he had developed mild symptoms \u2013 \u201ca temperature and persistent cough\u201d \u2013 over the last 24 hours. Johnson, 55, said he was now self-isolating and working from home and would continue to lead the national fightback against the virus.\nSpain recorded a new record single-day death toll. There have been 769 deaths in the past 24 hours, bringing the death toll to 4,858. The previous record was 738, between Tuesday and Wednesday this week. The country now has 64,059 confirmed cases, up from 56,188 yesterday.\nThe Spanish government has withdrawn 9,000 Chinese-made coronavirus testing kits from use after it emerged that they had an accurate detection rate of just 30%.\nThe number of cases in Iran has risen to 32,332, while the number of deaths hits 2,378, according to the country\u2019s health ministry.\nA spike in coronavirus patients means hospitals in and around Paris will reach saturation point within 48 hours, said the head of the French Hospital Federation. The peak is not expected until April. The death toll nationwide as of Thursday evening stood at 1,696.\nCovid-19 continues its spread across the African continent with 3,243 cases and 83 deaths now recorded.\nSouth Africa has reported its first deaths resulting from Covid-19, said health minister Dr Zwelini Mkhize. There are now more than 1,000 cases in the country.\nFirefighters, retired police officers and former ambulance workers are being drafted in to stop the NHS becoming overwhelmed. It comes as one in five police officers are off sick or self-isolating in areas worst hit by the virus.",

Basic hygiene and a lack of handwashing facilities and soap will be a major issue for poorer people.\n\u201cDeveloping countries are facing an unprecedented collective threat to human life, social cohesion and economic devastation,\u201d the letter to the G20 leaders said. \u201cMassive economic losses will be incurred as countries desperately try to cope, people will migrate out of fear as the epidemic takes hold, leading to social disruption, violence and security issues.\u201d\nThe group wants swift action to devote emergency spending to stricken developing countries, and longer-term reforms that make nations more resilient to outbreaks and natural disasters.\nAt least $8bn (\u00a36.5bn) in emergency funding has been requested by the Global Preparedness Monitoring Board, but that should be just the beginning according to the letter\u2019s signatories, who make it clear that the money required will be \u201cof a different order of magnitude\u201d to the amounts pledged so far.\nThe US is implementing a rescue package worth about $2tn, the UK government is spending more than \u00a3330bn on its recovery, and other countries are coming up with packages of their own. Poorer nations will need far greater levels of assistance than have yet been planned, according to the letter.\nErik Berglof, director of the Institute of Global Affairs at the London School of Economics, and an organiser of the letter, told the Guardian: \u201cIf it will take more than $2tn, perhaps as much as $6tn, to fix the US, we are not going to fix the rest of the world for less. To attach a specific number now is almost meaningless. What we need are new and creative ways of using the global financial muscle to back up existing international financial institutions.\u201d\nHe said that emergency resources and medical help could be provided quickly, but it was important to manage the process with a long-term view, expanding existing international institutions and programmes. \u201cYou cannot sprinkle money from helicopters in these economies because it would never reach the intended receivers,\u201d he said. \u201cYou need carefully managed programmes and projects that can help these countries through this extremely difficult period.\u201d\nInfrastructure investment would be vital to ensure recovery from a shock that, the economists said, would be greater than that of the 2008 financial crisis.\nIf efforts to control Covid-19 fail, \u201cthe virus could become endemic, producing new waves of destructive outbreaks around the world\u201d, the letter warned, adding: \u201cWe have a rapidly closing window to ensure that we give these countries at least a fighting chance to manage the crisis and provide some light at the end of what could be a long tunnel.\u201d\nThe letter concludes: \u201cWe are now urging you, the leaders of the G20, to urgently provide the necessary resources to reduce the losses in human life and back up those most vulnerable. The required investment is minute compared to the social and economic costs of inaction. History will judge us harshly if we do not get this right.\u201d\nThe signatories are: Kaushik Basu, former World Bank chief economist; Erik Berglof, former chief economist of the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development; Tim Besley, former president of the International Economic Association; Victor Dzau, president of the US National Academy of Medicine; Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust; Ahmed Galal, former finance minister of Egypt; Sergei Guriev, former EBRD chief economist; Bengt Holmstr\u00f6m, Nobel laureate; Anne Krueger, former World Bank chief economist; Justin Lin, former World Bank chief economist; Nora Lustig, co-founder of the Latin and Caribbean Economic Association; Ngozi Okonjo-Awala, former managing director of the World Bank; Christopher Pissarides, Nobel laureate; Dani Rodrik, incoming president of the International Economic Association; Michael Spence, Nobel laureate; Nicholas Stern, former World Bank chief economist; Joseph Stiglitz, Nobel laureate; Andr\u00e9s Velasco, former finance minister of Chile; Leonard Wantchekon, founder of the African School of Economics; Shang-Jin Wei, former Asian Development Bank chief economist.",

It told investors on Friday it planned to cut its budget for the year by almost a quarter to weather the oil price crisis.\nCairn will shave $20m (\u00a316m) from its North Sea spending plans to $45m, and will reduce its capital expenditure in Senegal by $70m to less than $330m. The company also plans to cut spending on exploring for new oil and gas reserves by a third, to $100m.\nSimilar spending cuts have been made by most major oil companies, which is likely to deal a blow to the engineering and equipment services companies which support major oil projects.\nIndustry trade unions and the Scottish Trades Union Congress are due to meet Scotland\u2019s energy minister, Paul Wheelhouse, later on Friday to discuss plans to future-proof the skilled workforce.\nMick Cash, the general secretary of the RMT trade union, said there had been \u201ca gaping hole\u201d in the government\u2019s response to the offshore impact of the coronavirus.\n\u201cEmployers have failed to engage with offshore trade unions over standardising the industry\u2019s response to coronavirus, even when there have been cases diagnosed on North Sea platforms, yet the UK government stands by and watches thousands of skilled energy workers being dumped without any comment whatsoever,\u201d he said.\nRystad Energy estimates that more than 1 million workers who provide oilfield services are likely to lose their jobs in 2020 as oil companies scramble to cut their costs. Companies are likely to lose 8% of their staff due to the coronavirus outbreak and 13% due to the collapse of global oil prices, the consultancy said.\nWeir Group, a FTSE 250 engineering services firm, said on Thursday it would cut its dividend amid fears that oilfield service companies would be the first to bear the brunt of the downturn. James Fisher & Sons, which supplies equipment to offshore projects, said it would suspend its final dividend and cut spending, including a freeze on directors\u2019 salaries.",

She was advised that if she followed government guidelines and self-isolated for 12 weeks the company could not guarantee her pay.\nPregnant women taking sick pay in order to self-isolate could also find they are not eligible for statutory maternity pay (SMP), which is calculated on the amount they get paid in the two months before the end of the 15th week before the baby is due.\nClaire, who works in customer service for a car insurance company, said she was not allowed to work from home even though she was 22 weeks pregnant, in the SMP qualifying period, and most of her colleagues were working remotely. \u201cMy family is putting pressure on me to stay home and not put myself or the baby at risk. I\u2019m so stressed I don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d she said.\nBrearley said many low-earning women would not currently qualify for statutory sick pay. According to research from the Trades Union Congress, 1.4 million female employees earn less than \u00a3118 a week \u2013 the qualifying threshold for statutory sick pay \u2013 while about 70% of those who do not qualify for statutory sick pay are women. Research by KPMG found 26% of working women earn less than the living wage (about 3.4 million women), compared with 16% of men. A Survation poll of women earning below the living wage found a third had no savings and 61% had savings to cover a month or less.\n\u201cMany of the women we have spoken to, particularly single parents, are telling us they suddenly have no income, no way of paying their rent or buying food for their kids,\u201d Brearley said. \u201cIt\u2019s a horrible situation, and it\u2019s been really stressful being at the coalface of that without any clear advice from the government to give.\u201d\nWomen\u2019s rights groups have warned that the current gender-blind response to the coronavirus crisis risks setting gender equality back years, and called for the needs of women to be factored into policymaking. This week more than 50 organisations signed a statement calling on the government to consider the specific challenges faced by women, while women\u2019s organisations are gathering data on how the crisis is affecting women specifically.\nSam Smethers, the chief executive of the Fawcett Society, said women were more likely to be on the frontline delivering essential services, in low-paid and insecure work and caring for children and older relatives, as well as significantly more likely to be put at risk of self-isolating with an abusive partner.",

        "content": "As this unforgettable night wore on, the teams abandoned their tactical systems and went for the jugular \nEamon Dunphy once described a hectic, high-scoring Premier League encounter as \u201clike watching two drunks fighting in an alley\u201d. He wasn\u2019t being wholly complimentary about that spectacle, but still acknowledged the thrill of seeing two sides cast off any pretence of tactical discipline and go for broke. Dunphy\u2019s phrase came back to me at Stamford Bridge in March 2012. Trailing 3-1 from the first leg in Naples, a 2-0 victory would have sent Chelsea into the Champions League last eight. Walter Mazzarri\u2019s Napoli, playing 3-4-3, arrived aiming to hit on the break.\nThe context was fascinating. Chelsea\u2019s first-leg defeat hastened the dismissal of Andr\u00e9 Villa-Boas, lured from Porto less than a year earlier. Roberto Di Matteo took caretaker charge of a battle-hardened team who had hated Villas-Boas\u2019s methods: John Terry, Frank Lampard and Didier Drogba among them. They had an unhappy recent history in the competition, often crashing out in controversial circumstances, complaining bitterly over perceived refereeing injustices.\nThe first thing I remember is the Napoli fans. Bunched in the opposite corner from where I sat, they were like nothing I\u2019d ever seen or heard. As they sang, chanted and gesticulated in perfect unison, the noise filled the arena. Forced to respond, Chelsea\u2019s fans lifted the energy further, creating an electrifying cacophony that was football\u2019s tribalism at its most thrilling.\nNapoli began in the ascendancy. Ezequiel Lavezzi and Marek Hamsik operated in a front three alongside the all-action Edinson Cavani, who should have ended Chelsea\u2019s hopes inside 25 minutes. The Uruguayan hit the side netting after Chelsea were cut open with a lightning counterattack, and wasted a three-on-two soon after. Danger was everywhere for Chelsea but they did not lack determination. Against the run of play, Drogba glanced in Ramires\u2019s whipped cross to send Stamford Bridge into delirium. The Blues believed, even more so after half-time when Terry\u2019s header made it 2-0: 3-3 on aggregate. Advantage Chelsea.\nNapoli\u2019s midfield schemer G\u00f6khan Inler soon hit back with a masterpiece of a goal, silkily controlling Terry\u2019s half-clearance on his chest, before drilling a measured half-volley beyond the motionless Petr Cech. The volume emanating from those Napoli ultras rocketed off the charts as the hosts, now needing two, contemplated another painful European departure.\nOf course there was more. Andrea Dossena\u2019s handball 15 minutes from time gave Lampard the chance to thump in a penalty, locking the tie at 4-4 overall. Things became increasingly ragged as the players battled to full time in what now resembled a school-playground epic: win possession, attack in numbers, rinse and repeat. Skill levels were high, while defending had become a distant memory as extra time beckoned.\nAn insanely sharp piece of work by Drogba set up the winner, the Ivorian\u2019s quicksilver turn and cut-back finding the iron-buttocked Branislav Ivanovic \u2013 nominally a defender \u2013 to deliver the knockout blow. Fittingly, Ivanovic\u2019s shot was all power and little precision, crashing centrally into the roof of the net, leaving Napoli flat on the canvas. \u201cGet in!\u201d yelled Andy Townsend in the commentary box. It was that kind of night.\nOn several subsequent visits to Naples I\u2019ve come to believe the warmth of the people, the history, and the food and wine combine to create Europe\u2019s greatest city. On their way to the trophy, meanwhile, Chelsea somehow billed themselves as plucky have-a-go heroes rather than the lavishly-funded plaything of a Russian oligarch. They saw off Benfica before Terry\u2019s kick at Alexis S\u00e1nchez left them with 10 men at Camp Nou in the semi-finals. They still won. In the final they trailed Bayern Munich, in Munich, before that monstrous Drogba header. The same man slotted the spot-kick that clinched their first European Cup.\nBut none of it would have been possible without that mad, attritional, punch-drunk night in London. As an elderly Italian fan remarked to me on the walk to the tube station, it had been \u201cmolto emozionante\u201d.",

        "content": "Dig into your wardrobe for comfy treasures that are well-worn but not completely worn out\nAt a fashion event the other day, a buyer introduced me to the concept of the third wardrobe. Most women already have a work wardrobe and an off-duty wardrobe, to some degree \u2013 how distinct or blended these are varies enormously, obviously. But now, she said, retailers think in terms of a third category: loungewear.\nThe third wardrobe consists of clothes to change into when you get home from work. It is what you wear on a lazy weekend morning or to settle in for a boxset on a Friday night.\nI am conflicted about this. On the one hand, loungewear might well be my favourite clothing category. If I have been in the office all day, I am quite likely to change into pyjamas within minutes of getting home, even before I have put the oven on. On the other hand, I am uneasy about the third wardrobe as a new shopping category. It\u2019s not as if starchy box-fresh newness is essential, or even desirable.\nWe can fashion a third wardrobe without a shopping list, revisiting clothes we have, re-homing treasures that languish unworn. Drilling down into the kind of clothes that work for you, figuring out the clothes that make you happy (and your life easier), will make you a smarter and more focused shopper: when you do spend, you will buy pieces you will wear and love for years.\nMy third wardrobe (this sounds grand: actually it\u2019s a shelf) operates largely as a kind of fashion retirement home. It is where nice things go to die. A once-luxurious cashmere sweater that the moths have attacked too often. Ancient wool trousers that are still a nice shape, just a bit too bobbly to wear in public. These tracksuit bottoms (pictured) which never quite took as fashion on me, much as I loved the look on other women.\nI find loungewear is much more versatile if it\u2019s reasonably nice-looking, not right at the painting-the-house end of its life. Loungewear is most useful if it works for plane or rail journeys, for working-from-home days when you might pop out, as well as in a twilight evening zone.\nIn many categories, the third wardrobe can be a hand-me-down depository. But I couldn\u2019t live without a nice pair of knitted joggers, with a drawstring waist and a cuffed ankle. That, to me, is the little black dress of this category. It takes pride of place in my loungewear wardrobe. Or rather, on the shelf.",

        "content": "The Brixton cruiserweight was close to hitting it big as the coronavirus crisis stopped boxing for the foreseeable future, but he is no stranger to isolation and is taking the blow in his stride\nI know I can go through hell,\u201d Isaac Chamberlain says calmly as, rather than making his comeback on Saturday night in a fight that had offered him so much hope, the most interesting boxer in Britain settles back into another testing period of isolation. \u201cI\u2019ve sacrificed so much it\u2019s got to the point that it\u2019s become normal to me to go through these trials and tribulations. The world is in a very tough place right now but I just think: \u2018I\u2019ve been here before, in a very dark place. This is how my life has been for a long time.\u201d\nChamberlain\u2019s latest spell of solitude has been enforced by coronavirus, which led to the inevitable cancellation of Saturday\u2019s bill in Coventry. His return was meant to be screened live on Channel 5. A second fight, on 25 April in London, has also been abandoned and so the Brixton cruiserweight has been consigned again to the wilderness.\nSeventeen months have passed since Chamberlain\u2019s last bout, a victory over Luke Watkins that helped ease the pain of his only defeat in the ring, on points to his bitter rival Lawrence Okolie in February 2018. His comeback has been derailed by a series of disasters. A family member stole \u00a310,000 from his O2-headlining purse for fighting Okolie while subsequent fights in America were cancelled and Chamberlain was let down by jailed promoters and wayward trainers.\nThe boxer has spent much of the past four months in a brutal Miami training camp, from where he has written regularly to me about his struggle to cope. When we first met in person, in November, Chamberlain emerged as a vibrant and engaging character who is also capable of deep introspection. He writes long and riveting insights into his psychology that sometimes left me worrying about his mental health. But he reassured me that writing is a way of controlling his torment.\n\u201cIt just makes me feel better, bro,\u201d he told me, \u201cand I like to write.\u201d\nI still found it striking that a boxer, who had once been an 11-year-old coerced into carrying drugs in south London while boys just a little older than him were stabbed to death, wrote with such sensitivity and eloquence.\n\u201cHell is a perception,\u201d Chamberlain wrote last November. \u201cOr perhaps it\u2019s a nightmare. What\u2019s hell to you could be mediocre to someone else. For some people fighting is hell to them. For me, inactivity has caused me more depression and made me drown in my own perception of hell \u2026 I\u2019m not talking about the physical and what you can see. I\u2019m talking about something much more detrimental and lingering. The hell in your mind. It makes you feel crazy to be you. I honestly can\u2019t stand the quiet whistling sound that I hear, when it\u2019s silent in my room and it\u2019s pitch black, as I\u2019m writing this at 5:18am.\u201d\nOn 11 December he sent me a photo of a single bed in a stark room. \u201cWe go again,\u201d Chamberlain wrote. \u201cI\u2019m in Miami now. 5,000 miles from home. Away from friends, family and loved ones. Alone. Rottweilers are barking outside. The dawn quickly turns to darkness. And reality sets in \u2026 \u201d\nA few weeks later, Chamberlain messaged me: \u201cThis wasn\u2019t the 2019 I wanted, but it was character building. I\u2019m in the ground now, buried. Sitting in my room on Christmas Day. But I will rise. Deep down an undeniable force is driving my actions. I must embrace it.\u201d\nOn 4 January, after moving into a hostel in Miami, Chamberlain sent me a photograph of him in a white vest standing against a grimy bunk bed. \u201cIn prison,\u201d he wrote.\nHis messages over the next eight weeks were much more cheerful. Chamberlain confirmed that he had signed a five-year deal with the British promoter Mick Hennessy, who steered Carl Froch and Tyson Fury to their first world titles. His upbeat mood continued as he spoke enthusiastically about how much it would mean to be back in the ring again. When I texted him news of my plan to write about him for the Guardian he replied: \u2018Amazing my brooooooo \u2026 \u201d\nBut then, on 17 March, he attached the official news that both his fights were off and that there would be no boxing for many months. Chamberlain is back in Britain but, as the lockdown intensifies, we have to do this interview remotely. I can hear the breath catch in his throat when I ask how he felt after he received the crushing, if hardly surprising, news. \u201cI was fighting back tears on the train, trying not to show anyone I was so upset. I was thinking, \u2018What more do I need to do? Why, just when I have my big break, does this happen?\u2019 But almost straightaway I told myself, \u2018Let\u2019s not be selfish here. The coronavirus is affecting everyone. It\u2019s bigger than me. Other people are suffering more than me.\u2019\u201d\nChamberlain sighs. \u201cBut you\u2019re fighting with your mind because you think how different it should have been. In my last week of sparring I was knocking guys out. I was that ready I was knocking guys out with 20oz gloves. I was destroying them.\u201d\nHe had been meant to spar in Miami against Yuniel Dorticos, the Cuban IBF world champion. \u201cI didn\u2019t in the end,\u201d he says. \u201cI sparred one of his guys and lit him up. That put them off. They want to have spars that build the fighter\u2019s confidence. I respect that. I get that. They\u2019re not going to want this crazy, hungry, young kid from London destroying Dorticos\u2019s confidence. I would have lit him up, 100%. So they would say to me, \u2018No sparring today\u2019 or \u2018He\u2019s not feeling so well.\u2019\u201d\nThe 26-year-old seems much more philosophical than I had expected him to be after another big setback. \u201cHow can I stop when I\u2019ve got this far? It\u2019s also been better because Mick Hennessy and his team are such great guys. I can talk to them and I never had that sort of relationship with [Eddie Hearn\u2019s] Matchroom. They really appreciate me and I have a lot of love for them because of the way they\u2019ve treated me.\n\u201cBefore, I was going through so much shit on my own. Now I have these people around me, consoling me, saying, \u2018Don\u2019t worry, Isaac. We\u2019ve got you. It\u2019s going to be OK.\u2019 It feels good for someone else to pick you up. It\u2019s not me picking myself up all the time.\n\u201cI also still feel really excited about the Hennessy deal. All their shows are free-to-air TV. There\u2019s a gap in the market because you can utilise that free audience of about three million viewers on average. Imagine if I turn it into four or five million viewers? That would be massive. I\u2019m charismatic. I can talk. I can fight. People were coming to see me because I was starting to sell both venues out.\u201d\nWhen does Hennessy expect boxing to resume? \u201cHe said: \u2018I\u2019ve spoken to some very important people. I think the next show will probably be in September.\u2019 I thought, \u2018Fucking hell \u2026. six months.\u2019 But then I calmed down. I just need to keep in good shape. It was so hard in Miami, so it\u2019s time for a little rest.\u201d\nChamberlain seems better equipped than many people to adjust to the lockdown. \u201cEveryone is talking about isolation and how they\u2019re struggling. Well, I\u2019ve been isolated in Miami for months. I was isolated from hope or any guarantee. It was hard but I got through it. I remember when I came back from Miami the time before this one I was so weak. I hadn\u2019t spoken to anyone for so long. I was really isolated. When people recognised me and friends spoke to me I thought, \u2018Oh, crap.\u2019 Now it\u2019s different.\u201d\nChamberlain is cushioned by his Hennessy contract and also by the sponsorship he receives from the TCA clothing line. Another company, Vonder Europe, have provided an apartment for him in north London during the lockdown. But he will not be immune to the uncertainty of the coming months. \u201c100%,\u201d Chamberlain says. \u201cBut I\u2019ve been very poor before. Even when it was tough in Miami I dealt with those conditions. If all my money went, it wouldn\u2019t be the end of the world. I\u2019d find a way.\u201d\nBoxing has already been his salvation. \u201cI got into boxing when I was about 11,\u201d he remembers. \u201cAround then I was still dabbling inside that street life where I was being manipulated [into delivering drugs] by older guys.\n\u201cWe grew up in Brixton and my cousin, Alex Mulumba, got stabbed in the heart after he\u2019d passed his GCSEs. It was a very sad time for the family. My mum brought me to the boxing gym because she didn\u2019t want me going down that road. I had started to become a product of the environment, hanging around those types of people. A lot of my friends from that time are dead or in prison on life sentences.\n\u201cAs soon as I got into the gym, it was euphoria. I was like, \u2018What is this? People hitting each other. This stuff is normal?\u2019 It was crazy, the sweaty gym walls and the stinky gloves. I loved it. I would be in there all day, every day. I\u2019m the type of person, especially as a kid, that if I liked something I would be obsessed with it. I\u2019m still like that. I\u2019ll just keep training hard even though I wouldn\u2019t know where my career was going.\n\u201cThe thing I loved most about boxing was that it lifted me up. I\u2019d never had those words of encouragement. People were saying, \u2018You could be a champion.\u2019 I was like, \u2018Shit, these people think I can be something.\u2019 I\u2019d never had that from teachers, not from my mum, not from anyone. I kept coming back so I could hear those words again because it felt so good. So boxing saved my life, big time.\u201d\nDespite the worrying and surreal times, Chamberlain sounds strong. I also point out that he has not been writing. \u201cThat\u2019s because I\u2019m not depressed. I only write when things are getting on top of me. I\u2019m still very optimistic.\n\u201cI still feel I will become a world champion. The world title belt I want is the WBC one. It\u2019s beautiful and it\u2019s my phone wallpaper. I look at it when I wake up and before I go to sleep. The current champion is Ilunga Makabu, from the Congo, and if we fight I\u2019ll destroy him. The cruiserweights out there are getting old and I don\u2019t think they\u2019re that good.\u201d\nOn Chamberlain\u2019s Twitter masthead it says \u201cThe Path To Paradise Is Through Hell\u201d.\nHe laughs softly and then, as is his way, Chamberlain offers fresh hope all over again. \u201cIt\u2019s true. Whatever you\u2019re going through, you can get past it. If you feel you\u2019re in hell right now, why would you stay there? That\u2019s why it\u2019s very important to keep going and keep pushing, no matter what life throws at you. That\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m doing. Keep working, keep believing, and you will come through it. I\u2019m a living testament to that. We can all get through this time.\u201d",

Patel took up the post in July last year.\nAmid the allegations, Sir Philip Rutnam resigned as permanent secretary at the Home Office, claiming constructive dismissal and accusing Patel of bullying her subordinates.\nSeparately, this month a review concluded that some of the failings that led to the Windrush scandal were caused by \u201cinstitutional ignorance and thoughtlessness towards the issue of race\u201d.\nThe independent reviewer, Wendy Williams, made a number of recommendations related to the issue of race, including regularly reviewing successful tribunal claims relating to race discrimination.\nSurvey respondents gave a broad range of reasons why they felt they had been discriminated against in the previous 12 months, including 637 respondents who said they had been discriminated against on the grounds of age, 518 because of ethnic background and 547 for gender.\nOf those who claimed they had been bullied, 1,444 said the nature of bullying was \u201cnegative micromanagement eg excessive control; made to feel incompetent\u201d, while 1,242 respondents said they had been \u201chumiliated in front of team or others\u201d.\nThe majority of complainants \u2013 1,227 \u2013 said they had been bullied by a colleague in the same area, directorate or division.\nA Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cReports of bullying, harassment or discrimination are at their lowest levels since 2016 but we are constantly looking at ways in which we can improve our culture and enable our people to thrive.\n\u201cThe home secretary recently spoke of her determination to make the Home Office a better place to work and to put fairness, dignity and respect at the heart of its mission.\u201d",

        "content": "Medical staff, care home and funeral workers tell of their struggles to cope and frustrations with authorities\nFor Sara Gayoso, and for tens of thousands of other medical staff across Spain, the last few weeks have been an unprecedented blur; an indistinct, urgent succession of days that drain into each other as health workers struggle to do what they can with what they have.\nBut, even by recent standards, the past few days have been bleak.\nOn Monday the defence minister revealed that soldiers drafted in to help tackle the coronavirus outbreak by disinfecting residential homes had found a number of elderly people abandoned and dead in their beds.\nThen medical unions announced legal action to try to ensure healthcare workers have the equipment they need to protect themselves, their patients and their families against the virus.\nOn Wednesday the death toll in Spain passed that in China, where the disease originated at the end of last year. Two days later, Spain broke another record with 769 deaths in 24 hours.\nGayoso\u2019s moment of coronavirus clarity had come a few weeks ago when an older woman was brought into El Escorial hospital outside Madrid, where Gayoso works as a doctor in the A&E department. The patient had pneumonia.\n\u201cThe hardest thing for me so far was having to stand two metres away and tell her daughter that they wouldn\u2019t be able to see her,\u201d Gayoso said.\n\u201cHer daughter\u2019s face just dropped and she said to me: \u2018So, I won\u2019t get to see my mother again?\u2019 She was worried about not being able to say goodbye properly and I couldn\u2019t even move close to her; I couldn\u2019t tell her that of course she\u2019d definitely get to see her mother again, because I had no way of knowing if she would.\u201d\nAlmost 15% of Spain\u2019s 64,059 cases of coronavirus have been health workers. In Madrid and other regions, stocks of basic protective equipment such as face masks are running dangerously low.\n\u201cThe material we have is being very strictly rationed so we don\u2019t run out,\u201d Gayoso said. \u201cYou\u2019re careful not to get your gown dirty because you know you\u2019ll have to reuse it, which ups the risk of contagion. We\u2019re having to take very good care of the high-quality material.\u201d\nIt was perhaps a perverse blessing that staff were so busy, Gayoso added. \u201cThere\u2019s no time to get angry or to wonder why things have been organised the way they have.\u201d\nHer colleague Pablo Cereceda, a surgeon and representative for the Amyts medical association, is in precautionary quarantine and has had more time to reflect \u2013 and to seethe.\n\u201cThe reality is that this is an epidemic that\u2019s getting the better of us and we need to ask why,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe only thing you can really compare this with is the situation we saw with the terrorist bombings in Madrid in March 2004. Yes, it was days of furious activity, especially for surgeons and those in ICUs, but it was nothing like this.\u201d\nCereceda and many other doctors and nurses argue that the pandemic has shown what happens when you make unprecedented demands on a health service that in many areas is still struggling to recover from the 2008 economic crisis and its deep attendant cuts.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been warning for years that we don\u2019t have enough nurses to look after patients even in normal circumstances, let alone in a pandemic like the one we\u2019re in,\u201d said Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda, a spokeswoman for the Satse nursing union.\n\u201cNurses are being sent in to treat infected patients wearing tattered robes and without masks, goggles and gloves. There\u2019s a massive shortage of protective equipment which means that we\u2019re picking up the virus, infecting our own families and becoming transmitters among the population.\u201d\nIf the number of infected nurses continues to rise, \u201cwho\u2019s going to look after all the patients?\u201d wondered Garc\u00eda.\nCereceda shares the same grievances and said the government and the central and regional health authorities should have acted far sooner than they did.\nHe is especially angry that huge public events three weeks ago \u2013 including International Women\u2019s Day marches, a 9,000-person meeting of the far-right Vox party in Madrid, and countless sporting fixtures \u2013 were allowed to go ahead despite what was going on elsewhere in the world.\n\u201cWe failed to listen to the alarm bells that were ringing in our sister country Italy and that\u2019s led to a huge, exponential growth in cases,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was a tsunami warning that they ignored. Now the wave\u2019s hit and we\u2019re all under water.\u201d\nIt isn\u2019t just hospital staff on the coronavirus frontline. Three residential home workers who are members of the Aetesys nursing association are in hospital after tending infected residents.\n\u201cHealth workers are dropping like flies at the moment,\u201d said the association\u2019s president, Elvira Gonz\u00e1lez Santos. \u201cAnd we\u2019re the ones who are being told to do the job that some nurses don\u2019t have to do; we\u2019re the ones who look after all a resident\u2019s hygiene needs.\u201d\nGonz\u00e1lez Santos and her fellow workers are horrified by the defence minister\u2019s stories and say they are doing all they can to keep looking after their charges. \u201cPeople need to remember that residential home workers are like family to the people who live there \u2013 we\u2019re the eyes and hands of the residents and we\u2019re the ones who sometimes fight their corner against the management.\u201d\nAnd then there are the funeral companies. Alfredo Gos\u00e1lvez, of the National Funeral Services Association (Panasef), said that on a normal March day undertakers would deal with 80 deaths in Madrid. They are now dealing with about 300.\nGos\u00e1lvez said his members also lacked the protective equipment they need \u201cas the last link in the public health chain\u201d and were struggling to keep up with the demand.\n\u201cFuneral workers are used to difficult situations and they\u2019re giving it all they\u2019ve got, working double shifts, 18-hour days and running themselves ragged,\u201d he said. \u201cHundreds of them haven\u2019t rested for days.\u201d\nTheir needs go beyond kit and rest. \u201cWe\u2019d like it if funeral workers could be included in the applause we hear around the country each night,\u201d Gos\u00e1lvez added.\nRitual applause, coffee, enduring vocations and the lack of any alternative are the main sustainers of much medical activity across Spain at the moment.\nJuan Camilo Meza is a \u201cvery, very tired but still healthy\u201d anaesthetics resident at Matar\u00f3 hospital near Barcelona. His intensive care unit has been forced to increase its capacity from 14 beds to 21, and every single one of the hospital\u2019s respirators \u2013 new, old, transport models \u2013 has been pressed into service.\nStaff are having to pick up new skills as they double up across different departments and, once more, masks and gowns are in short supply \u2013 although gloves and goggles are not.\nHospital psychiatrists and psychologists are now helping staff as well as patients but the strains are beginning to show and even the midnight-black humour of the medic is becoming as scarce as face masks.\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s putting in the same hours; you can see it in the bags under their eyes and in the fact that they\u2019re not making jokes like they used to,\u201d Meza said. \u201cYou can feel the tension and the fear in the air. No one was ready for anything like this.\u201d",

        "content": "UK prime minister and health secretary test positive as chief medical officer goes into isolation\nBoris Johnson and the health secretary, Matt Hancock, have tested positive for coronavirus, they revealed on Friday, leaving them each to work in isolation on leading the government\u2019s efforts to tackle the pandemic.\nLater on Friday England\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, said he was self-isolating at home after experiencing symptoms compatible with Covid-19.\nThe prime minister, who is 55, will self-isolate for seven days in his flat above No 11 Downing Street after announcing that he had mild symptoms of a cough and temperature.\nJohnson received the result at midnight, just hours after he was seen outside the door of No 10 clapping in support of NHS workers, alongside the chancellor, Rishi Sunak.\nHancock, who has responsibility for the NHS, said he would self-isolate until next Thursday. Whitty, who has not taken a test, said he would \u201cbe continuing to advise the Government on the medical response to Coronavirus, supported by my deputies.\u201d\nJohnson and Hancock have been in repeated contact with senior political figures, including cabinet members, and advisers in the last few days. But despite the two men testing positive, no other ministers or advisers would be tested for the virus unless they showed symptoms, Downing Street said.\nAsked whether Johnson and Hancock had been taking the same precautions they imposed on the rest of the country at the daily press briefing, Michael Gove said: \u201cThe fact that the virus is no respecter of individuals, whoever they are, is one of the reasons why we do need to have strict social distancing measures so that we can reduce the rate of infection and reduce the pressure on the NHS.\u201d\nAnd he told reporters: \u201cPeople are tested if they are symptomatic and those members of the sort of central effort in helping to defeat the virus who do show symptoms are appropriately tested. I think you can tell from the fact that the three of us are here demonstrates that there are three of us who have not yet demonstrated any symptoms.\u201d\nIt is unknown how Johnson contracted the illness but officials confirmed other people who worked in No 10 were self-isolating after having coronavirus symptoms.\nJohnson posted a video on Friday morning on Twitter saying he had a temperature and a persistent cough. \u201cI am working from home, I\u2019m self-isolating, and that\u2019s entirely the right thing to do,\u201d he said.\nIn the video, which Johnson recorded himself on a mobile phone, he said: \u201cBe in no doubt that I can continue thanks to the wizardry of modern technology to communicate with all my top team to lead the national fightback against coronavirus.\u201d\nOver the last 24 hours I have developed mild symptoms and tested positive for coronavirus.I am now self-isolating, but I will continue to lead the government\u2019s response via video-conference as we fight this virus.Together we will beat this. #StayHomeSaveLives pic.twitter.com/9Te6aFP0Ri\nThe prime minister\u2019s official spokesman said on Friday: \u201cThe prime minister\u2019s symptoms are mild and he is continuing to do all of the same functions he was performing before. The only difference is now he will have to do that by teleconferencing.\u201d\nJohnson chaired Friday morning\u2019s Covid-19 meeting of government ministers and health experts. His regular audience with the Queen has been conducted by phone for at least two weeks.\nAlthough the foreign secretary is officially the person who steps in to cover the prime minister\u2019s role if he is incapacitated, there are no plans for Dominic Raab to stand in for Johnson.\nJohnson\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cFrom the moment he had symptoms he took steps to ensure that he wasn\u2019t in close contact with anyone.\n\u201cHe did really want to take part in clapping NHS staff. It\u2019s something he felt was important, but in taking part in that national moment he ensured he didn\u2019t come into close contact with anyone.\n\u201cHe stood outside No 10 at a very significant distance from the chancellor.\u201d\nOn testing people who have been close to Johnson in recent days, he said: \u201cNo 10 is considered a workplace. The advice to staff here and the prime minister\u2019s colleagues is they don\u2019t need to do anything in terms of self-isolation unless they start to suspect that they have symptoms, in which case they should follow the Public Health England advice.\u201d\nNo 11 and the four-bedroom flat, which was previously occupied by the former prime ministers David Cameron and Tony Blair, have been sealed off from No 10 Downing Street and No 12 by shutting the doors that staff and government officials use to move between the buildings.\nThe prime minister will work from the office usually used by the chancellor, who has given it over to Johnson during his period of isolation. It has been kitted out with full videoconferencing equipment.\nSunak will continue to work from his office in the Treasury; it is not thought that his wife and young children are living at Downing Street. The last chancellor, Sajid Javid, lived in the smaller flat at No 10.\nIt is not known whether Sunak has been tested.\nSymptoms are defined by the NHS as either:\nNHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should\u00a0stay at home for at least 7 days.\nIf you live with other people,\u00a0they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.\nAfter 14 days, anyone you live with who does not have symptoms can return to their normal routine. But, if anyone in your home gets symptoms, they should stay at home for 7 days from the day their symptoms start.\u00a0Even if it means they're at home for longer than 14 days.\nIf you live with someone who is 70 or over, has a long-term condition, is pregnant or has a weakened immune system, try to find somewhere else for them to stay for 14 days.\nIf you have to stay at home together, try to keep away from each other as much as possible.\nAfter 7 days, if you no longer have a high temperature you can return to your normal routine.\nIf you still have a high temperature, stay at home until your temperature returns to normal.\nIf you still have a cough after 7 days, but your temperature is normal, you do not need to continue staying at home. A cough can last for several weeks after the infection has gone.\nStaying at home means you should:\nYou can use your garden, if you have one. You can also leave the house to exercise \u2013 but stay at least 2 metres away from other people.\nIf you have symptoms of coronavirus, use the\u00a0NHS 111 coronavirus service\u00a0to find out what to do.\nSource:\u00a0NHS England\u00a0on 23 March 2020\nJohnson\u2019s isolation will involve meals and work being delivered to him by staff, who will knock on the door and then give him time to collect it.\nThe prime minister\u2019s spokesman would not comment on whether his partner, Carrie Symonds, who is pregnant, was in Downing Street or would be self-isolating. The recommendation for members of the household of someone who has the virus is to self-isolate for 14 days.\nIn a video message, Hancock said: \u201cFortunately for me the symptoms so far have been very mild so I\u2019ve been able to carry on with the work driving forward the UK response.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be continuing to do everything I can to get our carers the support that they need. And I\u2019ll be doing that from here but with no less gusto.\u201d",

        "content": "US hedge fund manager\u2019s doom-laden TV appearance about coronavirus crisis sparked frenzied selling\n\u201cHell is coming,\u201d the billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman told millions of Americans in a 28-minute near-hysterical TV interview 10 days ago. He said the US was underestimating the severity of the coronavirus crisis. It would kill millions of people and devastate the global economy, he said.\nAt the same time Ackman, a well-known Harvard-educated hedge fund manager, had quietly placed a bet that stock markets would tank. Those bets made his hedge fund $2.6bn (\u00a32.2bn) \u2013 a near-10,000% return on his $27m stake.\nAckman\u2019s extraordinary doom-laden appearance on CNBC, in which he revealed he had evacuated his family and colleagues from New York City and said he expected the virus to kill close to a million Americans, spooked financial markets, sparking immediate frenzied selling.\nAs he spoke, the Dow Jones industrial average index, which was already down 1,000 points that day, collapsed further, triggering \u201ccircuit breakers\u201d designed to halt extreme turmoil, and the market closed for 15 minutes. When it reopened, it was down more than 2,000 points.\nIt lead Forbes magazine to report: \u201cThe billionaire interview that tanked the stock market\u201d.\nAckman just halted the market.\nAckman, the founder and chief executive of the hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management, also addressed Donald Trump on Twitter, saying: \u201cMr. President, the only answer is to shut down the country for the next 30 days and close the borders. Until a vaccine is manufactured, distributed and injected, we will go through a depression-era period in the country.\u201d\nMr. President, the only answer is to shut down the country for the next 30 days and close the borders.  Tell all Americans that you are putting us on an extended Spring Break at home with family. Keep only essential services open. The government pays wages until we reopen.\nHe added: \u201cMillions of people are going to die around the globe and as many as a million Americans, it\u2019s just math.\u201d\nThe emotional call-in interview, in which Ackman said he worried the virus could kill his elderly father and also bring about to the collapse of some of America\u2019s biggest companies, puzzled financial experts and commentators because Ackman said he was not selling stakes in the companies that his hedge fund owned. In fact, he told viewers, he was buying up bigger stakes in the very companies he warned would fail.\n28 October 1929\u00a0The original Black Monday. The Dow plunged\u00a013%, then a record, as the Great Wall Street Crash ended the bull market of the 1920s.\n29 October 1929\u00a0The Dow plunged\u00a012%\u00a0amid a second day of panic selling, wiping out investors who had borrowed money to buy stocks.\n19 October 1987\u00a0Wall Street\u2019s worst day ever saw\u00a022.6%\u00a0wiped off the Dow, sparked by worries about the US economy and fuelled by new automatic trading programmes.\n14 April 2000 The Nasdaq index plunged by\u00a09%\u00a0as the dotcom bubble burst, sending tech stocks down 25% in a single week.\n17 September 2001\u00a0After 9/11,\u00a0\u200bWall Street remained closed until 17 September 2001, the longest shutdown since 1933. The Dow fell\u00a07.1%\u00a0or 685 points on that first trading day, with airlines and insurers leading the rout.\u200band there were more steep losses in the days that followed. Among the biggest fallers were companies in the airline and insurance sectors.\u200b\n15 July 2002 The FTSE 100 tumbled\u00a05.4%, its worst daily loss during\u00a0a poor year dominated by fears of war on Iraq, tensions in North Korea, and economic stagnation\n10 October 2008 The collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 triggered an autumn of wild plunges,\u00a0with Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 shedding\u00a08.8%\u00a0in a single session\u200b, its worst day after the 1987 crash.\u200b\n22 September 2011 The FTSE 100 fell\u00a04.6%\u00a0as markets wobbled during the summer, hit by fears of a new global recession and the Greek debt crisis.\n24 August 2015 The FTSE fell\u00a04.7%\u00a0or 289 points, wiping more than \u00a370bn off the value of London-listed companies, amid a\u00a0wider global sell-off, prompted by fears about the health of China\u2019s economy.\n9 March 2020 Fears of a global recession triggered by the coronavirus, and the launch of an oil price war,\u00a0hit global markets. The FTSE 100 plunged\u00a07.7%\u00a0, pushing it into an official bear market.\nHedge fund managers have been known to spark fear in the markets to drive down the share price in companies in which they have short positions (bets against), but Ackman said he was buying up shares because they were the \u201cbargains of a lifetime\u201d.\nStephanie Ruhle, a banker turned business correspondent on the rival channel MSNBC, criticised Ackman for his \u201cwildly irresponsible\u201d diatribe. \u201cIn putting on that grand show while he was getting choked up talking about his father, he caused the markets to puke and he caused the circuit breakers to trigger\u201d she said.\nRuhle said it was perplexing that Ackman would make such a public performance of his fears when as a very well respected, rich and connected hedge fund boss, he could raise his concerns directly with Trump rather than grandstanding on TV and social media.\n\u201cMake no mistake, Bill Ackman could call the White House any day of the week,\u201d she said. \u201cI assure you, Jared Kushner [Trump\u2019s senior adviser and son-in-law] would love to take his call. But what has so many people wondering tonight, [is] why Bill Ackman, who maybe has the right idea, or very good intentions, would put on such a ridiculous show and cause such damage to an already panicked market. That\u2019s what\u2019s puzzling.\u201d\nThe puzzle appeared to have been solved this week when Ackman revealed in a letter to his shareholders that since late February he had been buying \u201ccredit protection\u201d hedges \u2013 bets that the markets would fall.\nThose hedges have paid off and Ackman\u2019s fund used the gains to buy shares in \u201ccompanies we love at bargain prices\u201d.\nWhile people around the world have been watching their savings shrivel, and 3 million Americans lost their jobs last week alone, Ackman\u2019s deals made him and his shareholders $2.6bn.\nAckman was already rich. His net worth before the crisis was estimated by Forbes at about $1.3bn. The son of the boss of one of New York\u2019s premier real estate financing firms, Ackman has inherited a love for luxury property. He splits his time between a $22m 13-room two-storey penthouse in the Upper West Side and a three-house complex on the beach in the Hamptons.\nIn 2015 he bought the penthouse of the 1,005ft skyscraper One57 for $91.5m as a \u201cfun investment\u201d. He uses the apartment on the 75th and 76th floors for extravagant parties to entertain his business and celebrity friends. Ackman planned to hold on to the six-bedroom, eight-bathroom penthouse with views of Central Park for a few years before \u201cflipping it\u201d \u2013 selling it at a huge profit in a few years.\nAckman, who studied for both his undergraduate history degree and MBA at Harvard University, set up his first hedge fund Gotham Partners with a fellow Harvard grad, David Berkowitz. The fund closed in 2002 shortly after the US securities and exchange commission (SEC) investigated alleged market manipulation in Gotham\u2019s shorting of shares in investment firm Municipal Bond Insurance Association (MBIA). The regulator found no evidence of wrongdoing, but six days of embarrassing public disclosures left the firm\u2019s reputation in tatters.\nAckman was not deterred though and went on to establish Pershing Square Capital with $54m of investment. It now has more than $8bn under management.\nHe prided himself on the diversity of the funds hires, with early recruits reportedly including a fishing trip guide, a tennis coach and a guy he had met in a cab.\nOn Thursday night Ackman released a statement defending himself against charges that his CNBC appearance was designed to spook the markets. \u201cOn CNBC, I disclosed my beliefs to the best of my ability,\u201d he said. \u201cYes, I got somewhat emotional as I talked about protecting my immune-compromised father from the ravages of the virus.\n\u201cBut I had become bullish because of my belief that the entire country would soon go into lockdown, and that would be the fastest and best way to minimise the impact of the virus. And that was why I explained that we were buying stocks. I also wanted to shout from the rooftops about the importance of taking the virus seriously so that we would build a consensus to lockdown the country as soon as possible.\n\u201cIn light of our concerns we had two choices: we could either sell all of our investments or hedge our portfolio. We chose to hedge coronavirus risk rather than sell because we are long-term investor, and we believe that all of our companies would eventually recover, and create substantial value over the long term.\u201d\nThe bet revealed this week is not the first time Ackman has profited from the coronavirus pandemic. He made a $650m gain selling a 1.1% stake in Starbucks at the end January for about $85 a share shortly after the chain closed half of its stores in China in the early stages of trying to contain the pandemic. Starbucks shares fell to $58 during his CNBC appearance. He has since bought back into the stock.",

        "content": "Claims that 300 soldiers in Aldershot are in crowded unit with no hygiene essentials\nThree hundred soldiers recalled to a barracks in Aldershot this week have complained they are being locked down without sufficient hygiene essentials amid concerns that their cramped conditions could lead to a coronavirus outbreak.\nTroops from the 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards said they had been asked to self-isolate with their families but then hauled back to an environment that had not been supplied with any personal hand sanitiser or other cleaning equipment.\nThe lockdown means soldiers have been unable to shop outside to obtain personal supplies, while people within the camp in Hampshire who are showing coronavirus symptoms have been offered no medical treatment or support, according to those in the unit.\nAlthough thousands of troops have been placed on standby to help tackle the coronavirus crisis, frustrated soldiers in Aldershot said it was not clear why they had been recalled to \u201cessentially an open prison\u201d.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve taken hundreds of people away from their families and their safe environments, only to thrust them in with hundreds of other people who are potential carriers, unbeknownst to themselves,\u201d according to a member of the unit who contacted the Guardian and asked not to be named.\n\u201cWe even have a dozen or so people within camp who are self-isolating through showing symptoms, and no effort is being made for them to receive medical treatment at all. They\u2019re just being told to stay in their rooms and if they have to smoke they\u2019re to smoke out of their window.\u201d\nThis week it emerged that 2,000 troops had been placed on 24 hours\u2019 notice to assist the health service or meet any other emergency request. A further 1,500 have been placed at 48 hours\u2019 readiness.\nBut concerns are growing in some quarters of the armed forces that the military is not practising physical distancing and could be at risk of spreading coronavirus when it is most needed, while images are circulating on social media of forces personnel conducting physical training in large groups.\nLeaked emails show commanding officers are treating each company as a single household unit for coronavirus purposes, and while efforts are made to respect the suggested two-metre physical distancing standard it is conceded that in training that cannot always be the case.\nAn email from a commanding officer in the Royal Engineers seen by the Guardian says: \u201cWhere we can respect social distancing in the training environment we should seek to do so.\u201d But it adds: \u201cThis will not always be possible, pleased [sic] be relaxed about this.\u201d\nIt says soldiers should be particularly careful if the public are watching them train on an exercise ground or elsewhere. \u201cConscious that out on the area we are subject to the scrutiny of the general public where we must be perceived to be adhering to social distancing as much as possible.\u201d\nMinistry of Defence sources argue the army is one of several unique public sector environments, which like the health service and police have at times to operate in groups. But they insist physical distancing and other Public Health England coronavirus guidelines are being observed where possible.\nSoldiers in the Grenadier Guards have single-person rooms, the army source added, and special arrangements such as staggered mealtimes had been arranged to help distance people while they are on standby at barracks. \u201cSoldiers are used to keeping good hygiene: there are rigorous hand-washing routines for instance,\u201d the source said.\nBut the concern among the Grenadier Guards is that whatever the intention, in practice troops are cramped when they could have been kept safely at home \u2013 and that creates unique risks as the highly contagious coronavirus spreads.\nThe Grenadier Guards soldier who contacted the Guardian described the eating arrangements and accommodation situation in Aldershot as laughable. \u201cSurely the safer option would be for people to just stay at home, that way minimising the risk of infection, instead of sharing tables, cups, plates and cutlery with 300 others?\u201d\nIt was impossible in practice to minimise contact with \u201cpeople living in what are essentially university-style dormitories that have a shared kitchen and shared washing machines and dryers which obviously present considerable risk of cross-contamination. No cleaning equipment has been provided such as hand sanitisers for personal use, so people are having to share their own limited stock.\u201d\nThe soldier said he hoped senior officers would have a rethink. \u201cSurely in the midst of a recruitment and retention nightmare for the army, this is absolutely the last image we should be portraying to the public? Especially if sometime soon we are to be heralded as saviours for deploying to help stop the spread of this virus, if the very soldiers on duty cannot be trusted to buy their own toilet roll from the shop?\u201d\nAn MoD spokesperson said: \u201cWe are well prepared for the outbreak of coronavirus, and have well-rehearsed plans in place for dealing with health matters. All our people have been reminded of the guidance issued by Public Health England, which is the same advice for the general population.\u201d",

        "content": "Espanyol and Atletico Madrid have followed Barcelona in announcing they will apply temporary pay cuts to their players as a result of the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Other Spanish first division clubs are expected to follow suit in the coming days, with Real Valladolid the only one so far to have announced that none of their staff will be subject to cuts.\nBarcelona had been unable to reach an agreement with their players, despite their willingness to negotiate a reduction. But the club will unilaterally apply legislation, known as an ERTE, which allows them to temporarily cut wages in exceptional circumstances. Atl\u00e9tico have also applied their wage cuts under this measure.\nA statement issued by Barcelona on Thursday night said the cuts would \u201cessentially reflect a reduction in the working day and thus a proportionate reduction in salary\u201d and would apply to \u201cboth sporting and non-sport staff\u201d.\nThe city\u2019s other club, Espanyol, announced they would apply cuts but said those would apply to sporting staff only: from the men\u2019s and women\u2019s first teams to the B team and the two under-19 sides.\nThat was followed by an open letter from Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s majority shareholder and CEO, Miguel \u00c1ngel Gil Mar\u00edn, in which he said they would be forced to seek cuts for those members of staff who have had to stop working or whose hours have been reduced significantly, among the football and non-football staff. He insisted that the changes would be limited to the \u201cstrictly necessary in order for things to work as they did before when the competition returns\u201d. He insisted the measure had \u201ca single objective[:] to guarantee the survival of the club.\u201d\nAccording to the statement released by Espanyol, meanwhile, the players have been advised and they \u201cunderstand and respect\u201d the measure, conscious of \u201chow delicate the situation is\u201d. They are prepared, the club said, \u201cto each an amicable agreement with the club without having to take more drastic measures\u201d.\nNone of the clubs has released details of the extent of the cuts applied. Barcelona and Espanyol have announced that they will put their facilities at the disposition of the health authorities as the coronavirus crisis begins to accelerate in Catalonia, while Atl\u00e9tico have said they will raise money for the Red Cross.\nValencia\u2019s owner, Peter Lim, has bought 50,000 FFP2 face masks and 300 thermometers that will be given to the Valencia regional government in the name of the club. La Liga meanwhile will stage an online charity concert on Saturday evening, in which more than 30 artists will perform, including Alejandro Sanz, Juanes, David Bisbal and Jos\u00e9 Merc\u00e9, each presented by a player from Spain\u2019s first division, with the captains from every club included. The proceeds will go towards buying materials to assist in the fight against Covid-19, which has claimed almost 5,000 lives in Spain.",

        "content": "Extraordinary move signals to US companies that they will not face sanctions over some breaches\nThe US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has suspended its enforcement of some environmental laws during the ongoing coronavirus outbreak.\nIn an extraordinary move that has stunned former EPA officials, the Trump administration said it will not expect compliance with the routine monitoring and reporting of pollution and won\u2019t pursue penalties for breaking these rules.\nPolluters will be able to ignore some environmental laws as long as they can claim in some way these violations were caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. In the event of an imminent threat to public health, the EPA will defer to the states and \u201cconsider the circumstances\u201d over whether it should intervene.\nThere is no end date set for this dropping of enforcement.\nAndrew Wheeler, administrator of the EPA, said that coronavirus had made it difficult for businesses to protect workers and the public while adhering to clean air and water rules.\n\u201cThis temporary policy is designed to provide enforcement discretion under the current, extraordinary conditions, while ensuring facility operations continue to protect human health and the environment,\u201d Wheeler said.\nThe new stance has caused uproar among former EPA officials and environmental groups who warn that the sweeping will pose a further risk to public health amid the pandemic.\n\u201cEPA should never relinquish its right and its obligation to act immediately and decisively when there is threat to public health, no matter what the reason is,\u201d said Cynthia Giles, who was head of EPA enforcement during the Obama administration.\n\u201cI am not aware of any instance when EPA ever relinquished this fundamental authority as it does in this memo. This memo amounts to a nationwide moratorium on enforcing the nation\u2019s environmental laws and is an abdication of EPA\u2019s responsibility to protect the public.\u201d\nA letter sent to the EPA by Giles and a number of other environmental advocates states that while it may be \u201creasonable in limited circumstances\u201d to relax certain enforcement during the crisis, the blanket waiver of environmental requirements poses a danger to the American public.\nThere is particular concern over air pollution emitted by industrial facilities, which are predominantly located in communities with large numbers of low-income people and people of color. Covid-19 attacks the respiratory system, with its spread causing states to scramble for more ventilators to prevent thousands of infected people from dying.\nThe air pollution that industrial plants will not have to monitor damages the respiratory system, which is especially dangerous for already at-risk populations who may also become infected with Covid-19, which attacks the lungs.\n\u201cExcusing the potential release of excess toxic air pollutants and other pollution that exacerbates asthma, breathing difficulty and cardiovascular problems in the midst of a pandemic that can cause respiratory failure is irresponsible from a public health perspective,\u201d the letter states.\n\u201cThis is not about reporting and paperwork,\u201d said Eric Schaeffer, executive director of the Environmental Integrity Project.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re flying blind because you\u2019re not monitoring for pollution and the public\u2019s flying blind because you\u2019re not reporting it, a lot of problems that come to light when you do those things are going to stay hidden,\u201d Schaeffer said.\nIn one example, oil refineries will not be compelled to report on and reduce their carcinogenic benzene emissions. Ten refineries, most of them in Texas, have already been exceeding limits.\nThe relaxation of environmental laws follows lobbying from the American Petroleum Institute, an oil and gas industry group, which sent the EPA a letter this week calling for the suspension of rules requiring repair of leaky equipment as well as monitoring of pollution.\nThe EPA\u2019s move goes even further than this request, although the regulator said it expects businesses will comply with laws \u201cwhere reasonably practicable\u201d and that it will not tolerate flagrant, intentional breaches of the law.\nHowever, Michael Brune, executive director of Sierra Club, indicated that the move may be challenged in the courts. \u201cWhile there may be no limit to the lengths Trump and Wheeler are willing to go for corporate polluters, there is a limit to what the public will allow,\u201d Brune said. \u201cThis illegal and reckless action will not go unchecked.\u201d\n This story was amended on 8 May 2020 to clarify that it is only the enforcement of some environmental laws that has been suspended.",

        "content": "The shadow Brexit secretary is on course to succeed Jeremy Corbyn. Now he hopes to lead his party without picking a side\nWhen John Erskine signed up a teenage Keir Starmer to the Labour club at Leeds University freshers\u2019 week in 1982, he had hoped to find a new recruit in the factional dogfight raging inside the party.\nBut he was disappointed. Erskine recalls the young law student\u2019s politics as being of the \u201cnon-aligned, conscience-driven left\u201d \u2013 something like a kind of political Methodism.\nInstead of joining in the running battles with Militant, Starmer took the view there were \u201cno enemies on the left\u201d and cracked on with his studies.\nThe overwhelming favourite to succeed Jeremy Corbyn, who steps down next weekend, Starmer has defied categorisation, declining to become a fully paid-up member of any of Labour\u2019s many overlapping sects.\nHe is neither a Corbynite nor a Blairite (to the extent that they still exist) and is irritated by other people\u2019s urge to pigeon-hole him.\nSpeaking to the Guardian as he launched his pitch for the leadership last December, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t find the badging of people helps, really. I don\u2019t need somebody else\u2019s name tattooed on my head to know what I think. There are fundamental principles.\u201d\nStarmer arrived at Leeds from Reigate grammar school, the only one of five siblings from a modest semi-detached house in Oxted, Surrey, to get to university.\nHe has spoken movingly about his mother\u2019s 50-year battle with Still\u2019s disease, which ultimately led to her being confined to a wheelchair and unable to eat. \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t have moaned. If you\u2019d asked her how she was, she\u2019d say \u2018fine, how are you?\u2019,\u201d he said.\nAfter a postgraduate degree at Oxford, Starmer moved to London where he shared a rickety flat in Archway with old school friends.\nHe joined the fashionably radical Doughty Street Chambers while carrying out pro-bono work for a string of apparently lost causes.\nConor Foley, an international human rights lawyer and aid worker who now lives in Brazil, worked alongside Starmer at the campaign group Amnesty International in the 90s.\nThe pair wrote a pamphlet, Foreign Policy, Human Rights and the UK, in 1998, making a string of recommendations, many of which were subsequently taken up by the Labour government.\nTony Blair\u2019s incorporation of the provisions of the European convention on human rights (ECHR) into UK law in the Human Rights Act catapulted Starmer and his fellow human rights lawyers from the lefty fringe of their profession to the mainstream, as the judiciary scrambled to absorb its implications.\n\u201cThere were various people who were, three years before, on the unacceptable left, suddenly found themselves in positions of authority,\u201d says Conor Gearty, a professor of human rights law at the LSE and another old friend. \u201cBecause we knew about it and nobody else did.\u201d\nFoley agrees. \u201cThe Human Rights Act - there are probably four or five people in Britain who got that legislation and understood the importance of that legislation, and Keir and I were two of them. There were other people who played a more prominent role. But he has always understood the strategic significance of international human rights law.\u201d\nFoley says that while the pair were working together at Amnesty he didn\u2019t sense any burning ambition in Starmer to enter party politics. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t where we were at. I think he wanted to be a human rights lawyer. I think that was really his dream.\u201d\nAnd anyway the Labour party of the time wasn\u2019t much to their liking, he says. \u201cThe Blairite party wouldn\u2019t have been something either of us were comfortable with. Not that we were anti, we just weren\u2019t that comfortable with it.\u201d\nStarmer\u2019s appointment as director of public prosecutions (DPP) \u2013 a campaigning human rights lawyer turned the nation\u2019s chief prosecutor \u2013 surprised some of his radical friends.\nLeftwing critics tend to describe his five-year stint at the top of the 6,000-strong Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) as the final stage in Starmer\u2019s metamorphosis from firebrand QC to well-coiffed pillar of the establishment.\nThey point to the all-night court sittings held to administer swift punishment to the 2011 rioters \u2013 which Starmer subsequently claimed had helped quell the disorder; and tough prosecuting guidance that imposed sentences of up to 10 years on benefits fraudsters.\nRebecca Long-Bailey\nA close ally of the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, the Salford MP and shadow business secretary has been groomed as a potential leftwing contender for the top job.\nPitch\u00a0Promising to champion \u201cprogressive patriotism\u201d.\n\nLisa Nandy\nThe Wigan MP has built a reputation as a campaigner for her constituency and others like it, many of which have fallen to the Tories. A soft-left candidate, she resigned from the shadow cabinet in 2016 over Corbyn\u2019s leadership and handling of the EU referendum.\nPitch\u00a0Wants to \u201cbring Labour home\u201d to voters that have abandoned the party in its traditional strongholds.\n\nKeir Starmer\nAmbitious former director of public prosecutions has led the charge for remain in the shadow cabinet. He was instrumental in shifting Labour\u2019s position towards backing a second referendum\nPitch\u00a0Launched his campaign by highlighting how he has stood up for leftwing causes as a campaigning lawyer, and unveiled the slogan \u201cAnother Future is Possible\u201d, arguing \"Labour can win again if we make the moral case for socialism\"\n\nSome individual cases are also regularly raised, though Starmer\u2019s friends insist they are impossible to judge without knowing what advice he received at the time.\nThe decision not to prosecute the policeman involved in the death of Ian Tomlinson in the G20 protests was widely criticised at the time, not least by Tomlinson\u2019s stepson, Paul King.\n\u201cHe [Starmer] has just admitted on TV that a copper assaulted our dad. But he hasn\u2019t done anything. He\u2019s the man in charge ... why hasn\u2019t he charged him?\u201d But Starmer insisted there was no realistic chance of a successful prosecution.\nHis decision was subsequently reversed after an inquest found that Tomlinson had been unlawfully killed, but the police officer, Simon Harwood, was ultimately cleared of manslaughter in 2012.\nGearty defends Starmer\u2019s overall record at the CPS, saying he managed to forge new policy ground by developing frameworks of guidance in controversial areas such as assisted dying, alongside the traditional role of making decisions on individual cases.\n\u201cThat is such a hard thing for any of us to do: to be both reactive, and also to have the capacity to be able to engage and drive the agenda.\u201d\nBoth of these skills should have better prepared him for life in Westminster. But his legal background hasn\u2019t enamoured him to everyone.\nHe was persuaded to run for parliament in 2015 in part by his longtime friend Ed Miliband, whose London home is not far up the Northern line from the Victorian terrace in Kentish Town that Starmer shares with his wife, Vicky, and two children.\nLabour appeared set to win, and he told his local paper, the Ham and High: \u201cI\u2019ve got my eyes set on winning Holborn and St Pancras and then doing whatever I can do to help a Labour government change the things that need changing.\u201d\nInstead he found himself in a parliamentary party relegated to opposition and wracked with division.\nDuring the darkest days of the Brexit drama, when Labour became embroiled in one parliamentary clash after another, Starmer was often criticised by colleagues for being too much a lawyer and not enough a politician.\nOne shadow cabinet colleague laughingly cites his resignation as shadow immigration minister in 2016, at the later stages of the mass exodus from Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s team in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum, as an example of his lawyerliness. \u201cIt\u2019s a classic \u2013 you have to read it three times to see what he\u2019s saying.\u201d\nIn it, Starmer said the \u201cchallenge of leadership\u201d was different in the light of the referendum result, but that he had \u201cmaintained his support\u201d for the embattled Corbyn until most of his team resigned. \u201cIt is simply untenable now to suggest that we can offer an effective opposition without a change of leader,\u201d he concluded.\nWhatever his qualms about the leadership, Starmer made the fateful choice to go back on to the frontbench in October 2016 after Corbyn convincingly saw off Owen Smith\u2019s challenge.\nIn the following three years he played a crucial \u2013 and, to some colleagues, infuriating \u2013 role in inching his party towards supporting a second EU referendum.\nHe chaired the \u201ccompositing\u201d meeting of grassroots delegates at the 2018 conference in Liverpool that resulted in a referendum finding its way into Labour policy as an \u201coption\u201d that should remain \u201con the table\u201d.\nHe earned rapturous applause from the remain-supporting membership when he used his speech to drop in the idea \u2013 then anathema to the leadership \u2013 that if another poll were held, remain would have to be on the ballot paper.\nThere followed many months of parliamentary wrangling with the Tories in public, and political clashes among Labour\u2019s most senior figures in private.\nStarmer styled himself as the torchbearer for the composite \u2013 and thus for the idea that a referendum couldn\u2019t be ruled out.\nIn public, he stuck scrupulously to the letter of every iteration of Labour policy. But in private, says one shadow cabinet colleague, the discussions were more robust.\n\u201cHe stretched the case as far as he could go but not to a point where he could be said to be out of line. But in the private meetings he was pushing very much harder. At every stage, we felt, and I said this many times, this is just a fucking ratchet.\u201d\nSome former MPs who lost their seats in pro-Brexit constituencies blame Starmer, in part, for the party\u2019s policy, which took many months of wrangling to arrive at and which infuriated leave voters.\nHe insists it was a sensible way of dealing with a deeply divided party, with a deeply divided electorate, that once arrived at was not explained or sold to the public.\nCertainly he made few frontline media appearances during the campaign, instead touring local constituencies to boost morale with members and candidates, a role he had also played in 2017, awarding himself the moniker Captain Marginal.\nIs he now more politician than lawyer? Angela Smith, the Labour leader in the House of Lords, who has sat in the shadow cabinet throughout Starmer\u2019s time in parliament, believes so.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody who\u2019s dealt with the Labour party, the shadow cabinet, the issues that he\u2019s dealt with over the past few years, could be accused of not being a politician,\u201d Lady Smith says.\n\u201cHe\u2019s not the kind of weirdly Machiavellian type some people associate with the word politician, but he gets the politics of an issue.\u201d\nErskine, who has watched Starmer\u2019s progress from afar since the Leeds days, says \u201ceverything is of a piece. It\u2019s of conscience, it\u2019s about incredible intellectual rigour, it\u2019s about being measured. And whilst it\u2019s not me, I have a lot of respect for it.\u201d\nThat measured style until recently appeared out of political fashion. Whatever Corbyn\u2019s shortcomings, he was capable of rousing passion in his army of supporters. Even Starmer\u2019s most staunch supporters concede that is not really his style.\nOne old friend recalls asking him to make a speech to a school about how he had risen from a pebble-dashed semi in Oxted to the top of his profession. It was an inspirational story, he recalls, but not an inspirational speech. \u201cHe\u2019s no David Lammy, Keir.\u201d\nAnother cites what they recall as a serviceable but not outstanding address at the funeral of his predecessor in the Holborn and St Pancras seat, Frank Dobson, last December, with the great and the good of the Labour party, including four past and present leaders, in the congregation.\nOne mourner recalls a non-plussed Labour grandee muttering afterwards: \u201cThat\u2019s the trouble with Keir: he doesn\u2019t rise to the occasion.\u201d\nBut Smith, who has seen Starmer up close over the past five years, has little sympathy for those who complain that he lacks pizzazz.\n\u201cI get quite irritated when people talk about him being dull. He\u2019s serious \u2013 and I rather like people being serious, particularly when you\u2019re dealing with serious issues,\u201d she says.\nAnd with politics-as-usual on hold as the world wrestles with Covid-19 and its consequences \u2013 which have already swept decades-long orthodoxies in their wake \u2013 she adds: \u201cHe\u2019s a serious grownup politician. I think he\u2019s the right person at the right time.\u201d",

The FTSE 250 tracking mid-cap companies lost 3.97% on Friday.\nThe property industry was left reeling on Friday after the government put the brakes on the housing market on Thursday night, urging buyers and sellers to put plans on hold until the coronavirus restrictions were no longer in place.\nThe move prompted a sell-off of shares in some of the UK\u2019s largest housebuilding firms. Barratt Developments and Taylor Wimpey were among the biggest fallers on the FTSE 100, down by 5.3% and 9% respectively, while Persimmon lost 11%. The property website Rightmove lost 6%.\nRedrow shares fell 8.6% after the housebuilder issued a Covid-19 update to investors. The company said it had stopped building new homes, was putting a significant number of employees on temporary leave and was in talks with banks to shore up its finances as the coronavirus hammers the construction industry.\nA slew of companies warned of negative effects from the virus response. They included:\nGatwick airport, which said it would shut one of its two terminals following a collapse in passenger numbers.\nRolls-Royce, the aircraft engine manufacturer, said it planned to significantly reduce all non-essential activity at its civil aerospace sites in Britain from midnight.\nCairn Energy, a North Sea oil producer, said it had that cut spending plans. More than 4,000 oil rig contractors in the North Sea have already lost their jobs, according to the lobby group Oil & Gas UK.\nFinsbury Food Group stopped production at its Manchester factory with the market for food services at pubs, restaurants and schools all but disappearing.\nThe crisis has forced large parts of the economy to shut down as people are advised to work from home where possible, and anyone with symptoms of Covid-19 being required to self-isolate.\nThe prospect of the disease spreading could also imperil the operation of other services. Royal Mail on Friday warned that it could be forced to reduce postal services because of the impact of the coronavirus.\nIn a statement to the stock market, it said: \u201cIn recent weeks, we have seen rising levels of sick absence as colleagues self-isolate or care for family members. We cannot rule out reductions to services as Covid-19 develops.\u201d\nThe company also cancelled its dividend for the year, warning that its UK parcels, international and letters business would be materially loss making in the 2020-21 financial year, while profits at its European parcels division GLS would be \u201csignificantly reduced\u201d.\nMany companies have warned they cannot estimate the size of the financial impact from the crisis. Balfour Beatty, a builder of infrastructure and other large construction projects, postponed its annual meeting and dividend on Friday, saying it did not know what the final impact of the lockdown would be.",

        "content": "Corona, the first full-length feature about the pandemic, is a one-shot thriller set in an elevator, an impressively speedy, if dubious, feat\nIn these times of self-isolation, it\u2019s easy to sit back and plot the type of coronavirus movie you\u2019d like to make. Maybe it\u2019s one about an embattled team of scientists and their desperate search for a vaccine. Maybe it\u2019s one about an estranged father who has to fight his way through police lines in order to give his son a birthday present. Maybe \u2013 because not everything can be a gritty drama \u2013 it\u2019s a hilarious comedy about a man whose trousers fall down whenever he coughs.\nEither way, the ideas you have right now are just that: ideas. If you had any real gumption, you\u2019d have followed the footsteps of the Canadian director Mostafa Keshvari and already written and shot an entire coronavirus feature film.\nBecause, incredibly, Keshvari appears to have done just that. Entitled Corona, the film takes place entirely within the confines of an elevator. Neighbours of different backgrounds enter \u2013 a Chinese lady, a pregnant woman, a wheelchair-bound Nazi with a swastika tattoo on his forehead \u2013 and panic begins to spread just as quickly as the disease. Or, as the movie\u2019s tagline puts it, \u201cFear is a Virus\u201d.\nA trailer for the film has already been released. Not to give too much away but \u2013 if I\u2019m reading this right \u2013 the Chinese woman starts coughing, which causes the elevator to stall. The lights go out. The emergency lights kick in, and for some reason they\u2019re red flashing submarine-style lights. Someone screams: \u201cWe\u2019re all going to die in here!\u201d The Nazi pulls out a gun. The Chinese woman starts crying. And then a man says: \u201cI think we\u2019re all being tested,\u201d which leads me to believe that Corona will posit that the spread of Covid-19 is down to an evil Saw-style puppet who created the virus in a lab as an unnecessarily complicated no-win morality test for humanity.\nI could be wrong, and I won\u2019t know until Corona hits the streaming services soon. But still, you can\u2019t knock the director\u2019s ambition. Keshvari had written the film, shot it and cut the trailer by 8 March, days before overt public jumpiness and weeks before the lockdown. You may have seen the spectre of the virus as a threat to your friends and family, but not Keshvari. He saw it as an opportunity to make a name for himself.\nHe\u2019s by no means a beginner \u2013 his short film I Ran was selected in the 2015 Cannes Short Corner Film Festival \u2013 but by almost definitely making the world\u2019s first coronavirus feature film, Keshvari\u2019s stock is bound to rise. Not an awful lot is known about him but, judging by his IMDb page, he used to be a banker, he gained a scholarship at Vancouver Film School, he\u2019s making a thriller about women\u2019s rights, he\u2019s a published poet and his personal quotes include: \u201cYour life is a movie, direct it before someone else will\u201d and \u201cPoint the camera where the light is and pull focus on your dreams.\u201d Hopefully he has a long movie career ahead of him. But, if he doesn\u2019t, you get the feeling that he\u2019d do quite well in the inspirational vinyl wall decal business.\nWhat\u2019s even more impressive about Corona is that Keshvari was able to add a level of en vogue artistry to the film, by recording the whole thing in a single shot. It should be seen as a distant cousin to 1917, perhaps.\nWhen all this blows over and we\u2019re hit with a deluge of Contagion-style films about the virus \u2013 some by established auteurs, some by plucky up-and-comers \u2013 we should make sure that we don\u2019t forget about Corona. We shouldn\u2019t have to watch it, because God knows time is precious, but we shouldn\u2019t forget about it.",

A similar scheme has already been offered to employees.\nHowever, it has emerged that the latest scheme will not help anyone who has set up a sole-person limited company, meaning thousands of freelance writers, photographers and others working in the creative arts will get no help from it.\nThe Guardian has been contacted by several of those affected, who say this will ruin them financially.\nThey will be covered for 80% their salary by the coronavirus job retention scheme if they are operating PAYE schemes, or face having to claim universal credit instead, with its far lower payouts.\nThousands of actors, designers, film crew and others found themselves out of work and unpaid when the government introduced its coronavirus restrictions.\nOne of those is a sound engineer who does work for documentaries for the BBC and Netflix. All his projects are on hold and his work has evaporated, he said.\n\u201cThis is a disaster for thousands of people like me,\u201d the worker, who did not want to be named, told the Guardian, after two hours on while calling the universal credit phone line.\n\u201cI was advised to set up the limited company as it was a tax-efficient way to operate, and because it makes processing payments much simpler. Many who work in this world have done the same. We are just as self-employed as those being helped, but inexplicably find ourselves left out the scheme. It\u2019s devastating.\u201d\nBrian Palmer, a tax policy expert at the Association of Accounting Technicians, said this group was stuck in the middle of the two bailout schemes.\n\u201cMany of this group draw a low salary and top up their income with dividends. They will not qualify as self-employed, or for a significant payment from the coronavirus job retention scheme. Instead, they risk dropping through the cracks,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe must ensure that everyone gets the support they need to stay afloat and that the UK economy is able to not only recover, but also to thrive.\u201d\nHeather Self, a partner at the accounting and business advisory services Blick Rothenberg, agreed this group was likely to be feeling left behind.\n\u201cThe government and HMRC have worked incredibly hard to get something out which will help the majority, but there are some losers.\u2019,\u201d she said. \u201cA family with one earner on \u00a351,000 will get nothing, whereas another with two people earning \u00a349,000 each will get two lots of support. Someone with a mix of self-employed and earned income also may not qualify.\u201d\nThe Treasury has been approached for comment.",

I know that as Covid attendances go up, non-Covid attendances die down. There is a concern about people feeling sick at home or having a heart attack and not coming to hospital as they are frightened.\u201d\nScriven said that while there were currently fewer coronavirus cases in Yorkshire \u2013 where he works \u2013 than in places such as London, \u201cwe have seen a few sick young people just sitting at home for five or six days getting worse and worse\u201d. He said they were experiencing \u201can eerie calm before a major storm\u201d.\nOn Friday the NHS said a further 168 people in England who had tested positive for Covid-19 had died, bringing the total number of deaths to 689. The patients were aged between 29 and 98 years old and all but four \u2013 aged between 82 and 91 \u2013 had underlying health conditions.",

The cost of commercial flights has skyrocketed.\nAmong the British people stranded in Lahore, Pakistan, is 60-year-old Tanweer Ahmed Khan from Manchester, alongside six members of his family.\nKhan\u2019s daughter, Ikra Naser, said her party, aged four to 65, had been due to fly back to the UK on Friday after visiting a sick relative but they had been stranded.\nNaser said: \u201cMy father has a severe heart condition and severe arthritis. He took enough medication to last until Monday but then we don\u2019t know what he\u2019ll do. My mum also suffers health conditions and she must travel with my dad to look after him, given how strong his meds are.\u201d\nThe outward flights cost \u00a3500 each for a return but the family is facing paying up to \u00a32,000 for a single trip back \u2013 if they can even find one to take. Khan said she had spent many hours contacting the FCO. \u201cBut they don\u2019t seem to care. I\u2019m scared for my parents.\u201d\nAnother Briton, Adnan Aftab from Birmingham, said he was with his mother who had underlying health issues.\nAftab said: \u201cThe medication she takes weakens her immune system. She only has limited medication with her and soon will be completely out. We have already forked out \u00a31,000 [on flights that were subsequently cancelled] and so don\u2019t have anything left.\u201d\nSahiba Sajid, an NHS hospital social worker from Leeds who is stranded in Pakistan, said: \u201cI\u2019m frustrated that I\u2019m not able to return. The team I work in was already under a lot of pressure before I went abroad and I can only imagine how they are managing. I just want to go back and work but I\u2019m stuck here instead.\u201d\nAfzal Khan, the MP for Manchester Gorton, said a significant number of British nationals were stuck in Pakistan.\nKhan said: \u201cI have been contacted by a number of constituents who are growing increasingly anxious about being unable to return home to the UK. Many have serious underlying health conditions and are running low on essential medication which is only adding to their anxieties. We are calling on the government to do more to bring British citizens home to safety.\u201d\nJulie McElhinney and Dave Wong, from London, were in the Nepalese mountains when it was announced that flights were to stop. \u201cWe struggled to find things in English to understand what was going on,\u201d said McElhinney.\nThey managed to get to Kathmandu but information was still scarce. \u201cWe were gleaning information from fellow travellers and locals, basically trying to work on rumours,\u201d McElhinney said.\n\u201cWe and others have used family to phone the Foreign Office, the embassy and airlines but mostly just had generic information that they are working on it. There\u2019s a lot of frustration that communications has not been good. We\u2019ve managed to reschedule flights for 4 April but we don\u2019t know if it will happen. The challenge for everyone is not knowing.\n\u201cWe feel apprehensive about what could happen in the coming weeks. There is uncertainty about food, accommodation, flights. A large number of locals have fled Kathmandu for their villages so a lot of things aren\u2019t open. Our Nepalese hosts have been trying their best to get us food and look after us but there\u2019s a lot of fear here about the poor medical facilities if Covid-19 was to take hold.\u201d\nWong said: \u201cThe main issue is the lack of transparency, action and progress from the British embassy when compared to our European neighbours.\n\u201cFurther up in the mountains there are people worse off than us and are worried about how they are going to get home. They\u2019ve spent all their money on multiple airline tickets and are struggling to get refunds.\u201d",

I\u2019ve been trying to do lots of work from home, but I noticed that on the days when I wasn\u2019t resting enough, my symptoms got a lot worse, particularly in the evening.\nIn the Covid wards, we\u2019re seeing some cases of diarrhoea, which I had too. If he has that, then he needs to make sure that he takes in enough fluid.\nThere\u2019s also anxiety to deal with. Boris Johnson must take downtime to switch off and bring down his stress levels. I felt guilty about infecting my partner, who is now more unwell than me. He has only been able to get out of bed for half an hour at a time for the last 10 days.\nBecause I haven\u2019t received my results, I still don\u2019t know for sure that I\u2019m Covid positive. My result can\u2019t be processed because the patient backlog, which is now over five days, has to be prioritised.\nIf we could test as quickly as the prime minister, then we perhaps could send people directly to the correct ward, avoiding the spread among our patients and saving patients with respiratory conditions in hospital.\nI would like to pass on to the prime minister, particularly in light of his positive result, that my colleagues and I have noticed that the podiums where they stand for prolonged periods of time appear to be too close together.\nKate Hunt, 47, a civil servant from Kinbuck, near Dunblane, Stirling, was one of six members of her local choir who came down with the virus.\nBefore I got the news, I had been feeling a bit ill over the weekend. I had a headache and a scratchy throat, but I just thought the throat thing was because I had been singing, and that I had PMT. The next day I still had a headache and a tiny cough, just like a throat clearing. You expect you would have a massive cough, but it was just a little thing.\nI didn\u2019t have a fever that I could notice, but the headache went on for about five days. After three or four days, I started to get a tight chest. One of my children tested positive as well, but he had no symptoms apart from a headache for one day, and he lost his sense of smell, which has come back now.\nSymptoms are defined by the NHS as either:\nNHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should\u00a0stay at home for at least 7 days.\nIf you live with other people,\u00a0they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.\nAfter 14 days, anyone you live with who does not have symptoms can return to their normal routine. But, if anyone in your home gets symptoms, they should stay at home for 7 days from the day their symptoms start.\u00a0Even if it means they're at home for longer than 14 days.\nIf you live with someone who is 70 or over, has a long-term condition, is pregnant or has a weakened immune system, try to find somewhere else for them to stay for 14 days.\nIf you have to stay at home together, try to keep away from each other as much as possible.\nAfter 7 days, if you no longer have a high temperature you can return to your normal routine.\nIf you still have a high temperature, stay at home until your temperature returns to normal.\nIf you still have a cough after 7 days, but your temperature is normal, you do not need to continue staying at home. A cough can last for several weeks after the infection has gone.\nStaying at home means you should:\nYou can use your garden, if you have one. You can also leave the house to exercise \u2013 but stay at least 2 metres away from other people.\nIf you have symptoms of coronavirus, use the\u00a0NHS 111 coronavirus service\u00a0to find out what to do.\nSource:\u00a0NHS England\u00a0on 23 March 2020\nI think the main thing was trying to rest, trying to drink plenty of fluids. You will lose you appetite a bit. Just keep drinking. A friend of mine who is a doctor told me that something they do for patients at risk of pneumonia is to get them to blow up a balloon. So we got balloons and started blowing them up.\nJust try not to panic. I think I got a bit panicky at one stage, thinking that my chest was going to get worse. I realised that was counterproductive because that was just making me want to breathe more rapidly. Just try to carry on distracting yourself, not worrying about it too much.\nMy symptoms were pretty mild compared with a lot of people.

It is not a national holiday.\u201d\nOfficers were trying to interpret rules that became law on Thursday, with new guidance issued overnight. People are confined to their home except to exercise, buy essentials and go to work where necessary.\nOn Thursday there was concern about checkpoints in North Yorkshire and Devon, among others, and Derbyshire police were \u201cdrone shaming\u201d people in an isolated beauty spot, saying their drive to the Peak District was not essential and therefore broke the lockdown.\nHewitt said: \u201cThe point here is to try to avoid people contaminating other people. We need people to adjust their behaviour. There is absolutely no intention to be heavy handed. I accept an image of one person in an open space is fine but if we end up tomorrow with dozens of people going to open spaces, we won\u2019t keep that separation.\u201d\nThe deputy chief constable of Hampshire police, Sara Glen, said she accepted there had been public confusion and that fresh, clearer guidance was being sent to officers.\n\u201cThe message that has gone out is almost like you can\u2019t go outside and exercise and walk your dog. That is wrong. I fully understand the concerns around the initial brief that came out,\u201d she said.\nSome of the largest difficulties for police so far have come not in urban areas but less densely populated areas. On Friday, Cumbria police declared the Lake District closed in an attempt to deter crowds.\n\u201cThinking of coming to the #Lakedistrict over the weekend? Don\u2019t, it\u2019s CLOSED. Daily exercise shouldn\u2019t include travelling to a different area by car. Start your walk, cycle or run from your home in your local area,\u201d the force tweeted.\nShaun Sawyer, the chief constable of Devon and Cornwall police, told the Guardian that closing roads on Thursday around Exeter had been a mistake. He said his main priority, other than responding to 999 emergencies this weekend, would be to police the lockdown.\nSawyer said: \u201cWhy does your dog need to get into a car to go for a walk? Your dog does not need to be driven to Dartmoor.\u201d\nHe said some people in his area saw coronavirus as a \u201cLondon thing\u201d, but it was spreading. People in Devon and Cornwall would see more officers around the beaches to prevent crowds.\nSawyer said of the lockdown: \u201cIt is confusing, it is frustrating. It\u2019s like you have to regulate every aspect of people\u2019s lives. I do not want to police that way. If I do, I\u2019d rather it was short, sharp and fair and worth it. I will have extra officers around the beaches and the rural areas this weekend.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cI am concerned if we don\u2019t land this correctly it affects relationships with the public in the future. I won\u2019t be OK if the public go against this.\u201d\nThe pace of change was causing extra work for police, he said. \u201cOur busiest time is calls to 101 after an announcement. People are confused and want to know what it means to them.\u201d\nNationally, some fines had already been issued for breaking the lockdown, but Hewitt said the police were not just doing the government\u2019s bidding and had not compromised their independence by implementing draconian powers. \u201cWe are not an arm of the state,\u201d he said.\nPolice said they wanted to avoid fines and arrests and would aim to persuade people to comply.\nThe government\u2019s updated guidance on Friday said: \u201cStay local and use open spaces near to your home where possible. Do not travel unnecessarily,\u201d stopping short of banning driving for these purposes.\n\u201cIf you have a garden, make use of the space for exercise and fresh air,\u201d it added. \u201cGatherings of more than two in parks or other public spaces have been banned and the police will enforce this.\u201d\nScotland\u2019s chief medical officer, Catherine Calderwood, said on Friday that family groups could travel together in cars for short distances to exercise, but again reiterated the guidance to stay as close to home as possible.\nPolice forces and local councils have been interpreting the official guidance in their own ways since Boris Johnson announced the lockdown on Monday. In Wales, Neath Port Talbot council posted a video on Facebook showing a drone flying around the town centre broadcasting a recorded message telling people to stay home.",

        "content": "Boris Johnson has contracted Covid-19 at a time when the country needs him most \u2013 but the UK has survived with incapacitated leaders before\nCabinet government had for most of this week already been replaced by Zoom government, but the fact that Boris Johnson has contracted coronavirus, and so been forced to self-distance himself from the nation that he rules, raises awkward questions about how the government control room will operate at probably its most testing moment.\nNo 10 has offered the reassurance that Johnson, rather than his deputy, the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, will if possible remain in charge, making the vital decisions in physical isolation in his flat in No 11 for the next week, connected to colleagues only by technology. If so, it brings a new meaning to the oft-repeated dictum that it is lonely at the top.\nThe promise that Johnson will remain in charge may be true, or just a holding operation designed to portray an air of serenity in these most abnormal and panicky times. This is an illness that can knock the fittest figure sideways, so it is too early to say how far he will be driven into his bunker.\nJohnson is also someone who thrives in direct personal contact with others, cheering up a room and instinctively reading the mood of the meeting or the audience before coming to a view. It is said he does his boxes, but values a discussion more.\nYet the political leader as recluse is something other countries have absorbed. Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, has been in isolation for a week after his wife, Sophie, contracted the virus, leaving him in sole charge of three children and a country bordering Donald Trump. He works from his study and ventures out each day on to the doorstep of his home to hold a press conference. No one else enters except for a single technician with rubber gloves to fix up a G7 Zoom conference. No red boxes, but a box of Lego has been delivered. His children, his aides say, have occasionally been told to shush because \u201cDaddy is on an important call right now.\u201d\nBut in Canada, it was only the prime minister\u2019s wife who was incapacitated. In the UK, the virus has hit the bullseye.\nThe civil service has experience of working its way round vacuums in power, and Johnson is not the first British leader to be incapacitated in government. Tony Blair needed time off for a heart operation, prompting Lord Levy\u2019s wife, Gild, to send him chicken soup, and Clement Attlee\u2019s knee joints became so rickety he could not broach stairs.\nWhile the Suez crisis cannot be blamed solely on a high fever, Anthony Eden, suffering from an infection of the liver ducts due to a botched operation, became excessively reliant on amphetamines during the autumn of 1956, which might go some way towards explaining his series of miscalculations. Theresa May struggled with diabetes as well as Brexit. Harold Wilson resigned prematurely, sensing that mental exhaustion had overtaken him.\nJohnson\u2019s own great hero, Winston Churchill, suffered two serious illnesses during the second world war, first in February 1943 and then in August 1944. On the first occasion, after an eight-and-a-half-hour flight from Algiers, he came down with a cold and sore throat. It took two doctors \u2013 his personal physician, Sir Charles Wilson, and Geoffrey Marshall, a physician at Guy\u2019s hospital \u2013 to persuade him of the seriousness of his illness.\nChurchill spent a fortnight battling with doctors, nurses and civil servants to ensure that they sent him a steady supply of decisions to make. Even as far away as the US, he developed a reputation as \u201cthe world\u2019s worst patient\u201d.\nOn the second occasion, he contracted pneumonia at the age of 70, an illness so potentially serious that his condition was never made public. Again, the supply of papers to his bedroom was curtailed, with only the most critical allowed to enter his chamber. At times Churchill flew into a rage when he realised how much was being held back from him.\nJohnson, unlike some of his aides, probably does not seek to monopolise power and has not been in office long enough to have adopted a definitive governing style. The outbreak of the virus had prompted a reorganisation of his administration in which he was at the apex. Four subcommittees reported to him, marking a formal centralisation of power in No 10 and the Cabinet Office. So his absence will be felt.\nOn the other hand, the ship of state\u2019s broad course has now been set after an initial fortnight of confusion. No matter how hard the headwinds, no great adjustment is planned, so it is not the worst moment for the captain to be forced below deck.\nTwo great qualities will be demanded in the next fortnight. The first is a tireless focus on implementing the decisions taken, the remorseless grind of following through and making sure the Whitehall machine delivers. Any minister at the heart of the response to the financial crash in 2008 will recall the sensation of pulling a policy lever in Whitehall, only to realise the lever was entirely disconnected from the real world.\nDecisions taken and announced are not decisions implemented. Johnson\u2019s forte is not in enforcement, so he will not be missed in that department. The Treasury, Work and Pensions, Revenue & Customs and health and business are the lead ministries.\nBut if Johnson is truly forced to leave the scene for more than a week, and the national death toll mounts, he will be missed as the person to reassure the nation that recovery is in sight. David Cameron described it as \u201cthe sunny uplands\u201d passage of a speech. It is not a speech that can be delivered from a sickbed.",

It was an unprecedented show of collective gratitude, inspired by a Dutch woman living in the UK, by a nation whose Brexit vote caused a shortage of medical staff as it sent EU citizens away. A clapping nation whose government created a \u201chostile environment\u201d to banish the Windrush generation, who made vital contributions to the NHS.\nI also thought of supermarket workers on low wages now risking life and limb, generally with no gloves or masks. There is little consideration for their safety. If it weren\u2019t for them we would not be eating.\nThe clap was a show of appreciation by a public that elected a government that has been rapidly privatising the very service we were applauding. But it also showed the nation\u2019s longstanding and deepening love for the NHS, and acknowledged our dependency on it. The clap strangely transcended the bitter rows of the last few years.

But if at some future point they could be held personally liable for not putting their firms into insolvency, that may cause them not to carry on.\n\u201cAt the current time of emergency we need as many companies as possible to keep going, providing employment and providing goods and services keep the economy going.\u201d\nThe radical shakeup of the bankruptcy regime would require legislation and would be likely to require MPs to return to Westminster after recess, despite suggestions that the Easter break could be extended.\nThe Liberal Democrat leadership contender Layla Moran, who has called for a more lenient bankruptcy regime during the crisis, said that would be the right thing if it allowed some firms to weather the storm.\n\u201cThis change would require legislation but we would have the political will to make it happen. We must do this, jobs are on the line,\u201d she said.\nSome companies have been criticised for continuing to trade during the crisis, though there has also been widespread confusion about which economic activities must be curtailed as a result of the government\u2019s rules.\nIn his broadcast on Monday evening, the prime minister urged the public to stay at home but also said they could travel to work if their job was essential and they were unable to work from home.\nThe government has so far declined to order construction work to halt, with Johnson insisting he does not want to \u201cshut down the economy\u201d.",

It isn\u2019t, 25 March) on the Covid-19 pandemic rather implies that it is a \u201cblack swan\u201d event. It may be for most of us, but not for epidemiologists, for whom this pandemic is not outside the range of expectation. Neither should it be a black swan for anyone whose knowledge of history goes back to 1918. Would you rather the pandemic was managed by those for whom it is a black swan event, or those for whom it is not? I\u2019ve published peer-reviewed papers on modelling disease epidemics with data, and am aware of the limitations of my knowledge in the current situation. But my expertise does allow me to back those epidemiologists calling for testing of random samples of the population, to measure the size of the epidemic so it can be properly managed. Failure to do so amounts to abandoning evidence-based medicine.Simon WoodProfessor of statistical science, University of Bristol\n I was a member of the Cobra committee as a representative of the Health and Safety Executive in the mid-2000s. During that time a risk assessment identified a pandemic as the greatest threat to life in the UK. HSE had the greatest expertise in personal protective equipment which was identified as being essential. The government tested a response to dealing with a pandemic that was successfully implemented with the flu pandemic. The World Health Organization identified this virus in early January. I cannot understand why it has taken so long to get suitable PPE to those caring for the rest of us.Graeme HendersonWandsworth, London\n Nassim Nicholas Taleb and Yaneer Bar-Yam rightly criticise the pseudoscience of the behaviourism the government promotes in tandem with the expertise of epidemiologists and virologists. But there is one psychological principle that helps explain the misery that the crisis has engendered. Attachment theory and research shows that, when faced with a threat, we are biologically programmed to seek proximity to our loved ones \u2013 the very thing this crisis stops us doing. The result: anxiety, depression, grief and, initially, denial.\nA first step is to acknowledge the loss not just of lives but of ways of life, which for the young includes travel, education, fun, friendship. Only then will hope follow \u2013 creative solutions and a much-needed sociopolitical reset. Sadness and mourning should not be short-circuited.Dr Jeremy HolmesBarnstaple, Devon\n The claim that the government was unaware of the EU procurement initiative for ventilators and protective equipment (No 10 claims it missed deadline for EU ventilator scheme, 26 March) is implausible. We referred to this scheme in a paper in the British Medical Journal on 31 January. The European commission announced it at a press conference on 17 March. It has received wide publicity in the European press.

Officials have described the hospital as \u201coverwhelmed\u201d, \u201coverrun\u201d and calling out for one thing: \u201cHelp.\u201d\n\u201cPeople are going to die,\u201d said Francisco Moya, the New York City council member who represents the Elmhurst neighborhood. \u201cThe rate in the next few days [will] continue to go up, and people are going to get scared and get shocked.\u201d\nThe US surpassed virus hotspots China and Italy with 82,404 cases of infection on Thursday night, according to a tracker run by Johns Hopkins University. Hours earlier, New York\u2019s mayor, Bill de Blasio, had announced there were 23,112 Covid-19 cases in New York City alone, and 365 deaths. Queens accounts for one-third of cases in the city.\n\u201cElmhurst hospital is at the center of responding to this crisis. It\u2019s the No 1 priority of our public hospital system right now,\u201d de Blasio said on Thursday.\nThe hospital is located in one of the poorest and most diverse areas of the city, home to 20,000 recent immigrants from 112 different countries. It was already operating at 80% capacity before the coronavirus pandemic, with plans to expand its emergency department. One doctor told BuzzFeed the facility is \u201cheld together by a shoestring\u201d. It was operating at 125% capacity as of Thursday morning, with dozens more people lined up outside seeking tests and treatment.\nIn the Elmhurst and the nearby Corona neighborhood, one in four people lack health insurance. One in four live in poverty. Those numbers have probably grown since Covid-19 put a record 3 million Americans out of their jobs, with more expected to file for unemployment next week.\n\u201cThat is a highly immigrant neighborhood,\u201d said Do Jun Lee, a professor of urban studies at Queens College whose research focuses on immigrant delivery workers. \u201cA lot of the Latinx immigrant workers come from that part of Queens \u2013 Elmhurst, Jackson Heights, Corona \u2013 and they work all over the city delivering food.\u201d\nNew York City is home to 560,000 undocumented immigrants. There is a gulf between the sort of healthcare an undocumented immigrant and a native-born American can access. A city report found 94% of US-born New Yorkers had health insurance, compared to only 42% of undocumented immigrants, in 2018.\n\u201cA lot of the workers who are going to be vulnerable live in Elmhurst, which is a hotbed of what\u2019s going on with the virus right now,\u201d said Lee. \u201cIf they need emergency care, they\u2019re going to be going to a hospital that is already overwhelmed.\u201d\nMoya was born at Elmhurst hospital, worked there before he joined the city council, and has represented the hospital for 10 years. He has had daily phone calls with the hospital\u2019s CEO.\n\u201cIt\u2019s what was happening in Italy or Spain, but it\u2019s happening in our backyards \u2013 in Queens,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s real and troubling and scary and when you have a high rate of undocumented people who have to work,\u201d said Moya, citing the many food delivery workers, recent immigrants, low-wage and contract workers who live in the area, \u201cthey\u2019re not given the right protection.\u201d\nMoya and fellow council member Carline Rivera wrote a letter to Donald Trump on Thursday saying the hospital and others in Queens were \u201cbesieged\u201d and calling for more resources.\n\u201cElmhurst and Queens hospitals is besieged by this disease. If you speak with any of the staff there, the desperation in their voices is unmistakable,\u201d they wrote.\n\u201cDoctors describe scenes in apocalyptic terms. Patients are reportedly dying in the emergency room still waiting for a bed. Residents line the block, standing inside barricades and in the rain waiting to get tested.\u201d\nElmhurst hospital is at the center of responding to this crisis. It\u2019s the number one priority of our public hospital system right now. The staff on the frontlines are going above and beyond. We\u2019re doing everything we can to get them what they need. https://t.co/RBIGRRcbe5\nLike so many other hospitals in the US and across the world, Elmhurst has also been struggling with a lack of vital equipment and protective gear for medical workers, to help prevent them contracting the disease.\nor job security. Many of them with mild COVID symptoms are willing to wait for hours in the waiting room for a simple work note from a doctor to mitigate the employment consequences of missing their shifts in order to safely self-quarantine.\nMost seem deeply concerned with the missed wages. All of this contributes to the rapid spread of Coronavirus in Queens. Ultimately this epidemic will reveal the flaws in our economic system as much as the flaws in our health care system.\nUnder normal circumstances, Elmhurst has a 15-bed intensive care unit. Now, it is full with Covid-19 patients who require invasive intubation to be on ventilators. As of Thursday morning, 45 of the hospital\u2019s now 63 ventilators were in use, a person with knowledge of hospital inventory said.\nThe patients that come into the hospital, an official said, are extremely sick and deteriorating quickly. No visitors are allowed in the hospital, and the wards whirr with mechanical ventilators.\nIn the last 48 hours, 50 additional hospital staff have been sent to Elmhurst hospital, and 60 patients transferred elsewhere to try to alleviate the strain on hospital staff. De Blasio said he is transferring another 40 ventilators to the hospital.\n\u201cThe staff are giving their all to save every patient, but tragically this disease continues to take a terrible toll on the most vulnerable,\u201d de Blasio said. \u201cTo the men and women working at Elmhurst right now: your city sees you, your city thanks you and more help is on the way,\u201d he added.\nDoctors who have spoken to the New York Times and other US media reported almost running out of ventilators; working with a \u201cmotley\u201d assortment of protective equipment; and admitted patients being left in waiting rooms for hours before a bed is available \u2013 often when someone dies.\nWhile Elmhurst appears to be one of the hospitals taking the brunt of the New York outbreak, facilities around the city and state are braced for a surge in patients as the number of cases continues to increase.\n\u201cIt is extraordinary. This is like nothing I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d said Dr Dara Kass, an emergency medicine professor at Columbia University medical center. \u201cEvery day is escalating in emergency rooms all over the city.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing an increased number, where 75% of all patients being seen are being seen for some condition related to the coronavirus,\u201d Kass said. \u201cI saw 20 patients in four hours, and 16 of them had symptoms of viral syndrome of Covid.\u201d\nKass said she believed outer borough hospitals may be getting hit harder by Covid-19 patients because, unlike in Manhattan, patients there would not have had the resources to leave when the city shut down.\n\u201cManhattan is not seeing the same volume of patients as Brooklyn, Queens and upper Manhattan and the Bronx,\u201d she said.\nPeople were lined up around the corner and standing in the rain to get COVID-19 tests at Elmhurst Hospital yesterday.This is the most overloaded hospital in the city, operating at WAY over 100% capacity and needs resources immediately\u2014docs, nurses, PPEs, everything. pic.twitter.com/u6wfq9kkIo\nMoya said many of his constituents live in tightly-packed apartments, renting only a single room, or care for elderly relatives. Immigrant food workers, like those Lee interviewed, typically earn between $2-$4 an hour before tips and have no health insurance. And they are not necessarily young. The median age of a Chinese immigrant food delivery worker is 46.\nMichael Czaczkes, who lives five minutes from Elmhurst, walked past families huddled together in a line that stretched down the entire block on Monday, even as the weather turned cold and rainy. He said two older residents in his building have told him they\u2019re afraid to go to Elmhurst \u2013 in case they too might get sick.",

An announcement could be made following talks next week, with the organisers hopeful of rescheduling the tournament for later in the year as a backup plan.\nWith the Masters and US PGA Championship already postponed, the US Open and Open are the two men\u2019s majors left in their designated spots. The US Open is due to start on 18 June at Winged Foot in New York and reports in the United States suggest an unsurprising postponement is imminent.\nWith more than 200,000 spectators due to attend the Open, set for 16-19 July, there is a rising sense the coronavirus pandemic will not have settled sufficiently for the tournament to be staged in satisfactory form for players or fans. The Open clearly falls under \u201cmass gathering\u201d criteria, with issues relating to mass international travel also pertinent.\nThe R&A\u2019s contingency has been the topic for deep discussion at high levels in recent days. Weather and light restrictions would theoretically leave September as the last month the Open can be played. This year is the 149th playing of the Open, with No 150 scheduled for the home of golf, St Andrews, next July. With that in mind, the tournament\u2019s organisers are anxious to hold their major this year. Any extended schedule delays could affect Royal Liverpool and Royal Troon, which have already been confirmed as venues for 2022 and 2023.\nThe R&A pointed towards their statement of last Thursday when asked for an update on the Open. In it, the chief executive, Martin Slumbers, said: \u201cOur absolute priority is to ensure the safety of players, fans, officials, staff and all involved in our championships and that will be at the forefront of our thinking as we monitor developments.\u201d\nIt was announced on Friday that the Evian Championship, a women\u2019s major, has been rescheduled for 6-9 August from 23-26 July. The August window was originally intended for the women\u2019s Olympic golf tournament, before the Tokyo Games were postponed. It is thought the PGA of America also hopes to play the US PGA Championship, originally set for May, from 6 August at Harding Park in San Francisco.\nMeanwhile, the former US Ryder Cup captain Davis Love III and his wife escaped without injury after their home in St Simons Island, Georgia burned down early on Friday morning. \u201cWhile everyone in our family is saddened at the loss of our home that was filled with so much laughter and incredible memories, we\u2019re very blessed that everyone is safe and unharmed,\u201d said Love.",

The Local Government Association (LGA) said councils would need extra funding if they were to meet the deadline.\n\u201cThese are unusual times, so I\u2019m asking for an unusual effort,\u201d an email from Louise Casey, who was appointed last week to lead the government\u2019s response to Covid-19 and rough sleeping, read. \u201cAs you know, this is a public health emergency.\u201d Casey, who also worked as Tony Blair\u2019s homelessness tsar, said it was vital that night shelters and all street encampments be closed down, to stop the spread of the disease.\nLater Luke Hall, the junior housing minister, wrote a letter to the leader of every local authority in England asking them to house all people sleeping rough and to find alternative accommodation for people in hostels and night shelters by the end of the weekend, in order to prevent the spread of coronavirus.\n\u201cIt is now imperative that rough sleepers and other vulnerable homeless are supported into appropriate accommodation by the end of the week,\u201d he wrote. He went on to instruct each local authority to set up a Covid-19 rough sleeping \u201ccoordination cell\u201d and highlighted the importance of stopping homeless people from congregating in day-centre facilities to reduce the risk of transmission. There was no new funding for this request, but Hall referred council leaders to an earlier announcement of \u00a31.6bn for local authorities\u2019 Covid-19 response.\nIn a significant departure from normal rules, he also stressed that people classified as having \u201cno recourse to public funds\u201d (a status given to people who are seeking asylum, or who have a limited immigration status), who normally have no right to housing support or benefits, should also be helped with emergency accommodation. But it was not clear how councils would fund this provision. The letter simply instructed them to \u201cutilise alternative powers and funding to assist those with no recourse to public funds who require shelter and other forms of support due to the Covid-19 pandemic\u201d.\nJames Jamieson, chairman of the LGA, said councils were already working hard to protect rough sleepers from becoming sick by getting them into accommodation. \u201cTo help these efforts, some councils will need to call on the government for urgent help to find accommodation and enforce this and have access to funding if they need to cover staffing and support costs,\u201d he said.\nJon Sparkes, chief executive of the homelessness charity Crisis, welcomed the government\u2019s request, but also questioned how councils would fund the exercise. \u201cThe government\u2019s insistence that everyone sleeping rough should be housed by the weekend is a landmark moment \u2013 and the right thing to do,\u201d he said. \u201cQuestions remain about how local councils will be supported to do this, and whether additional funding, or assistance securing hotel rooms, will be made available. We also need to see a package of support so that, when the outbreak subsides, the outcome is not that people return to the streets.\u201d\nHe said the government should now make a national appeal for empty accommodation, such as apartment blocks and hotels, to be handed over to councils so that homeless people can be accommodated.\nRough sleepers at Heathrow airport were told to move out on Thursday. Paul Atherton, a filmmaker who has been homeless for a number of years and who this week has been sleeping at Terminal 5, said dozens of homeless people had been told to move on, without clear instructions about where to go. He had not received assistance from Westminster council in getting housing on Friday and was pessimistic about the prospect of being accommodated. \u201cThe likelihood of anyone being housed before the weekend is infinitesimally small,\u201d he said, suggesting that the government\u2019s request would have been more powerful if it had ordered local councils to comply.\nThe World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.\nThe UN agency\u00a0advises\u00a0people to:\nMany countries are now enforcing or recommending curfews or lockdowns. Check with your local authorities for up-to-date information about the situation in your area.\u00a0\nIn the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should\u00a0stay at home for at least 7 days.\nIf you live with other people,\u00a0they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.\nSharon Thompson, the Birmingham councillor responsible for homelessness, said she was optimistic the city\u2019s known rough sleepers could be rehoused \u2013 30 had been found places to live, leaving another 20 needing help. She said the task had been made more complicated by the closure of hotels that housed people in temporary accommodation and the difficulty in getting all rough sleepers to agree to go into housing. \u201cWe won\u2019t be scooping people off the streets unless the government tells us to. We\u2019re not looking to go down an enforcement route,\u201d she added.\nThe charity Praxis, which supports migrants and refugees, said it this week had helped a woman fleeing domestic violence into emergency charitable accommodation. She had been refused help by her local authority because she had no leave to remain. \u201cNo one should be left to fend for themselves during this global pandemic. This is a matter of public health as well as care for individuals,\u201d the CEO, Sally Daghlian, said.\nJessie Seal, of Naccom, an organisation that last year helped accommodate 1,300 destitute migrants, said she was concerned by the lack of clarity over who was to fund housing people who have no recourse to public funds. \u201cIt is clear that local authorities need additional funding to support people with no recourse to public funds, and the Home Office must make policy-level changes to enable this. Without change from the Home Office, people will continue to be turned away from homelessness support services on the ground,\u201d she said.",

        "content": "Group calls for independent review of project it says would permanently damage Kosciuszko national park\nEngineers, economists, energy specialists and environmentalists are calling for a final decision on the Snowy Hydro 2.0 project to be delayed to allow an independent review, claiming it will cost far more and deliver far less than has been promised.\nThe group of 30 said the 2,000-megawatt pumped hydro storage project in the Snowy Mountains would permanently damage the Kosciuszko national park.\n\u201cSnowy 2.0 is not as it has been publicly portrayed,\u201d they said in a joint statement. \u201cThere are many alternatives that are more efficient, cheaper, quicker to construct and incur less [greenhouse gas] emissions and environmental impacts.\u201d\nThe group was assembled by the National Parks Association of New South Wales and Ted Woodley, a former managing director of Energy Australia. In a letter to the prime minister, Scott Morrison, and NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, the members said they hesitated to raise the issue during the unparalleled challenge of the coronavirus pandemic, but they were concerned about the project going ahead without \u201cindependently validated justification\u201d.\nThey said they were sceptical about the merits of Snowy 2.0 when it was announced by former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull in March 2017 and that scepticism had consolidated as more information emerged.\nTheir listed concerns included that they believed:\nAbout 40% of the energy generated is lost before it reaches consumers, more than other pumped storage schemes due to the distance between reservoirs being far longer, and more than other storage options.\nIt was likely to cost at least $10bn, compared with Turnbull and Snowy Hydro\u2019s initial estimate of $2bn. A $5.1bn contract has been signed as part of the project, with further costs to be added. They say this will be more than the Snowy Hydro\u2019s estimate of the market benefit of between $4.4bn and $6.8bn.\nIt would require substantial transmission works to connect to the grid, costing billions more.\nIt will lead to more than 50 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions during construction and the first 10 years of operation.\nIt will convert extensive areas of national park into a construction site, with permanent damage over thousands of hectares and the destruction of habitat used by 14 threatened species.\n\u201cSnowy 2.0 should not proceed on the basis of overstated claims that have never been tested,\u201d the letter concluded. \u201cAt stake are billions of dollars of Australian taxpayers\u2019 money, tens of millions of tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions and thousands of hectares of Kosciuszko national park.\u201d\nThe project was proposed by Turnbull as a 50% expansion of the celebrated scheme, which was built over 25 years, starting in 1949. The official estimated cost of Snowy 2.0 has more than doubled and the timeline for completion has been pushed out from 2021 to 2027 since it was announced.\nAsked for its response, the federal government said it would be responding to the letter in writing.\nA Snowy Hydro spokesman said an environmental impact statement was being considered by the NSW Department of Planning, Industry and Environment, and the issues in the letter had been raised and responded to before. He said only 0.01% of the national park would be permanently affected by this project.\nSome issues raised in the letter, including what the project would cost, how long it would take to develop and its impact on the environment, have been raised by energy analysts since the project was announced. Letter signatories to have detailed criticisms before include Woodley and Bruce Mountain, the director of the Victoria Energy Policy Centre at Victoria University.\nTony Wood, energy program director with thinktank the Grattan Institute, was not a signatory to the letter, but said he agreed with much of what was in it, including that there should be an independent review, not least because it was public money being invested.\nHe said the process by which Snowy Hydro had been announced before there had been a feasibility study was \u201cordinary to say the least\u201d, and some of the claims about its financial case remained unclear.\n\u201cSurely they could clear the air by tabling an independent review of the project, given it\u2019s not a typical or listed company,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government is the shareholder on behalf of the people of Australia.\u201d\nA further concern some have raised but that is not mentioned in the letter is that the development risked giving the Snowy Hydro company, which is owned by the federal government, too great a hold over the energy market. In his book Superpower, economist Ross Garnaut suggested Snowy Hydro be broken in two so the existing generator and retailer was separate to a new body responsible for ensuring constant capacity to balance electricity supply and demand across the national grid.\nThe group behind the letter suggested a review could be taken by the Productivity Commission, Infrastructure Australia, the federal chief scientist, Alan Finkel, or the NSW chief scientist and engineer, Prof Hugh Durrant-Whyte.",

        "content": "As the coronavirus pandemic destroys jobs across Australia, New Zealanders who have lived and worked here for years are finding they have no access to welfare\nLess than a month ago, New Zealand citizen Sven Nielson was working full-time in the tourism industry in Queensland and supporting his two Australian-born children.\nNow, like thousands of other New Zealanders living in Australia, he is facing the prospect of having no income and a complete lack of government support or assistance.\nWith the Covid-19 pandemic decimating the tourism industry, Nielson\u2019s hours were drastically reduced before being cut entirely. Because he is a New Zealand citizen living and working permanently in Australia on the special category visa, he is ineligible for virtually all forms of welfare, despite having worked in Australia for nearly a decade.\nHe is now looking for work but the prospects are not good. With his landlord helping with the rent, Nielson will be able to keep a roof over his and his children\u2019s head, at least in the short-term.\n\u201cI certainly don\u2019t have a month or two months\u2019 worth of savings,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve got a total lack of financial support due to a lack of work because of something out of my control. I\u2019ve gone from full-time work to nothing.\n\u201cThe end to this problem is not in sight. I\u2019ll either find work or I\u2019ll have to pitch a tent next to a park.\u201d\nNew Zealanders can live and work in Australia indefinitely on the special category visa, which they receive automatically upon arrival. But due to changes in 2001, they are ineligible for nearly all forms of welfare, including sickness allowance and the JobSeeker payment, as well as the National disability insurance scheme.\nThere are an estimated 650,000 New Zealanders living and working in Australia on this visa, many in casual or hospitality jobs either shut down or under threat due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\nThose who have lost work and are facing financial hardship due to Covid-19 are ineligible for the JobSeeker allowance, and have found it virtually impossible to return to New Zealand. Even if they did, they would have to quarantine for two weeks and then go into the full lockdown that has been imposed around the country.\nWith highly limited flights and skyrocketing prices, this is no longer an option for most. With jobs lost, little prospect for new work and no government support yet, many are now facing an uncertain future and potential homelessness.\nDiane* has lived in Melbourne since 2004 and is married to an Australian, with two children. She works part-time in healthcare, but is ineligible for permanent residency due to the salary threshold.\n\u201cWorld-changing events like this are happening and you realise you don\u2019t have the same safety net that people around you do,\u201d Diane said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re living, functioning and contributing to society but we\u2019re not considered in the same boat \u2013 we\u2019re in immigration no-man\u2019s land. They\u2019re happy to have us here, have us contribute and get the benefits of that, but they won\u2019t support us when we need it.\u201d\nChristel Broederlow, a New Zealander living in Australia who runs the Maori in Oz Facebook page, says she is receiving several messages every day from people worried about how they will survive over the coming months after losing their income.\n\u201cI\u2019m getting inundated every day with messages from Kiwis who have lost their jobs all around Australia,\u201d Broederlow said. \u201cIt\u2019s upsetting. We\u2019re finding it quite overwhelming.\n\u201cSome people will have savings for a couple of weeks or a month but if this is prolonged it\u2019s quite frightening to think of the dire consequences for people.\u201d\nLabor has called on the government to temporarily extend the JobSeeker payment to New Zealanders currently in Australia on the special category, with shadow human services minister Linda Burney writing to social services minister Anne Ruston last week.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t let people in our country fall through the cracks, we need to support New Zealanders and other temporary migrants who contribute so much to Australia and will need support during the Covid-19 crisis,\u201d the shadow minister assisting for immigration and citizenship, Andrew Giles, said.\nRuston now has the power to extend these payments to temporary visa holders without the need for new legislation, and has signalled that the government is mulling whether to do so.\nA spokesperson for Ruston said: \u201cWe are investigating options for expanding support to vulnerable people which could include assistance for paying bills and buying other essentials such as food, clothing and petrol.\u201d\nThe New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has also raised the issue directly with Australian prime minister Scott Morrison, calling for a \u201cshort-term exemption\u201d.\n\u201cWe are providing care to Australians here, we think it is the right thing to do,\u201d Ardern said on Friday.\nMore than 200,000 people have now signed a Change.org petition calling for New Zealanders to receive full Centrelink support during the ongoing crisis.\nThis could save lives during the ongoing crisis, Broederlow says.\n\u201cThey just want assistance through this period,\u201d she said. \u201cWe pay our taxes but in a crisis situation we\u2019re not getting any financial help from the government.\u201d\nMany of these New Zealanders have made a life in Australia, but have not met the high salary threshold to obtain permanent residency. Returning home to a country they haven\u2019t lived in sometimes for decades is now not an option.\nSusan\u2019s* government contract role is about to come to an end. With a number of jobs she had applied for now being scrapped, she is facing the prospect of having to try to return to New Zealand in the coming weeks.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been here since 2013, this is my home, this is where a lot of my friends are. I have worked hard here,\u201d she said. \u201cSomething needs to be done or there\u2019s going to be homeless people, and there\u2019s going to be crime.\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t have savings and we can\u2019t access any type of support from the country we\u2019re born in or the country we reside in, we\u2019ll be forced to work to support ourselves and potentially spread the virus.\u201d\nEven for the New Zealanders in Australia lucky enough to currently still have employment, the constant uncertainty and lack of a social safety net to catch them is leading to stress and anxiety.\nDan Codyre is a freelance graphic designer who has been based in Sydney for nearly two decades. He has had a number of jobs cancelled due to Covid-19 already.\n\u201cBecause the market is so soft at the moment, freelancers are the first people to not have work,\u201d Codyre said.\nIf all of his work dries up, Codyre would be forced to return to a country he hasn\u2019t lived in for 20 years, with no work or support around him.\n\u201cI\u2019ve spent my entire career here paying tax and building a network of clients, but there\u2019s no support,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would really be a huge life upheaval. My life is here.\u201d\nThis uncertainty is already having a huge impact on thousands of New Zealanders in Australia, Broederlow said.\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a huge increase in New Zealand citizens already feeling that stress and reaching out to get some mental health guidance,\u201d she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t know what to do. They feel like their hands are tied behind their backs and they\u2019re frantically trying to reach out for some kind of financial assistance and assurance.\u201d\nWhether the federal government decides to temporarily extend some welfare payments to New Zealanders or not, those facing ongoing uncertainty need answers soon.\n\u201cIf not we need to look at every other measure we can to help feed these families. We\u2019ll have to pull out all stops,\u201d Broederlow said.",

        "content": "Vulnerable women and children in self-isolation are facing the prospect of being forced to stay inside with an abusive partner\nWith the number of cases of Covid-19 climbing by the day and the country debating whether to go further into lockdown, for some the prospect of staying inside is just as dangerous as going out.\nThe relationship between Covid-19 and domestic violence has been seen wherever the virus has spread. From Wuhan to New York, the associated financial, health and domestic pressures that come with a lockdown act as a pressure cooker on men who are already violent and controlling.\nIn Australia, those who work in frontline services are well aware of the risks. They will continue to operate and for the last two weeks these organisations have been holding planning sessions as they brace for what comes next.\n\u201cWomen will be even more socially isolated. The thing that happens behind closed doors that we\u2019ve tried to open lately, tried to raise awareness about, Covid-19 will slam the door shut with a vengeance,\u201d Karen Bentley says.\n\u201cAnd there are going to be so many other things that are going to fall out of this. We\u2019ve been talking among ourselves about the things some women will be experiencing as a result of this as bad actors and abusers take advantage of the situation.\u201d\nBentley, the national chair of Wesnet, the national peak body for domestic and family violence services, says what is needed is a coordinated national response.\nWith face-to-face contact no longer possible, most communication will take place over the internet, by phone, or through police intervention. This raises questions about what will happen if a woman needs to leave home suddenly, or cannot find crisis accommodation quickly.\nHayley Foster, CEO of Women\u2019s Safety NSW, says that at least within her own state, police handling of domestic violence cases may have improved greatly in recent times but under the pressure of a lockdown, how they handle interactions will be critical. Without specialised oversight from trained officers, it is possible first responders may make the wrong call, at the wrong moment.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to heavily rely on a police response,\u201d Foster says. \u201cThere was also a significant concern raised in the web conference today about the emergency measures in NSW which will see prisoners being granted bail early.\n\u201cDomestic violence services haven\u2019t been consulted and we need to know more so we can help assess the risk to public safety in releasing certain DV offenders while also keeping the victims informed of his release.\u201d\nThe other question is one of funding. Dr Merrindahl Andrew from the Australian Women Against Violence Alliance says a spike in demand during extraordinary circumstances will test service providers as they are pushed to their limits.\n\u201cPart of the problem is all of the funding gaps that existed before the pandemic. Those cracks will be wider now. They are cracks that people will be falling through with even more damaging results because of the pandemic,\u201d Andrew says.\nOne such example is the discontinuation of the Telstra Safe Phone program administered by Wesnet and funded by the Department of Social Services. The department has been contacted for comment but has not responded by deadline.\nThe program which offers women safe, unmonitored phones will now be discontinued as of 1 July this year after funding cuts \u2013 even though it has never been more in demand.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got agencies ringing us, they\u2019re trying to get more phones,\u201d Bentley says. \u201cWe\u2019ve even had an increase in the number of women contacting us directly trying to get hold of phones.\u201d\nIn a letter to senators Maurice Payne, Anne Ruston and the prime minister, Scott Morrison, on Thursday, the Queensland senator Larissa Waters backed calls from the family violence sector for more funding to restore services like the Safe Phone program, dedicated crisis accommodation, specialised police services and a national awareness campaign.\n\u201cServices are reporting that the expected increase in violence is now a reality. Additional funding and support for frontline services is essential to keep women and children safe in the coming months,\u201d she said in the letter.\nSuch additions would make a world of difference for vulnerable women and children facing the prospect of being forced to stay inside with an abusive partner.\nWithin New South Wales, Foster says the information her organisation collects from frontline staff may not show an uptick in crisis calls yet, but they are seeing a growing number of inquiries from vulnerable women making preparations ahead of an lockdown.\n\u201cAs of yesterday we have 40 per cent of our services saying they\u2019re seeing the first cases [relating to Covid-19[ coming through but they\u2019re also saying there\u2019s a lot more complexity to cases,\u201d Foster says.\n\u201cSo the issues now are how we are going to find housing for people in a lockdown? Do they have complex legal needs? Are there custody arrangements that are going to make this difficult? And income. How are they going to sustain an income?\u201d\nFamily violence survivor and advocate Nicole Lee says that this is to be expected. Many women will have individual strategies to reduce or minimise harm to themselves and their children in the home, but many will also struggle if they are forced to seek help.\n\u201cIf I can relate it to my own experience as someone with a disability, my whole connection to the outside world was through my support workers and through my partner,\u201d Lee says. \u201cIf he decided I wasn\u2019t going to see anybody, I wasn\u2019t going to see anyone.\n\u201cWhat hope you do you have if you need to escape? What happens if you need to call 1800 RESPECT and you are deaf? Or speak a second language? The ways people are going to be controlled [by an intimate partner] via this virus, it\u2019s going to be shocking.\u201d Lees said it was important to note that people could still access services through webchat.\n\u201cI would assume any government, Liberal or Labor, would be looking to send money to those services. They\u2019d have to be thinking about doing that. And anybody would be imploring them to do that.\u201d\nIn Australia, if you or someone you know is impacted by sexual assault, domestic or family violence, call 1800RESPECT on 1800 737 732 or visit 1800RESPECT.org.au.

Like the rest of the Australian arts industry, it has been plunged into chaos and uncertainty by the coronavirus crisis \u2013 but we\u2019re hearing less about film and TV because decisions have been more piecemeal; publicly announcing that a shoot has been stopped is more complicated \u2013 and involves more stakeholders \u2013 than announcing a venue is closed.\nScreen Producers Australia believes at least 60 shoots around the country have had to postpone or cancel, with around 20,000 people being stood down, put on unpaid hiatus, or losing their jobs altogether. But Matthew Deaner, that organisation\u2019s CEO, says even that number is likely to be an underestimate. According to their preliminary survey, the economic impact is at least $195m in postponed production spending \u2013 but that figure will likely increase as more productions are shut or delayed. \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of fat to cut,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a real strain. We\u2019ll see bankruptcies.\u201d\nProduction designer Fiona Donovan has worked in the Australian industry for 27 years. This is the worst downturn she\u2019s seen.\n\u201cIt was pretty bad in the early 2000s, but this? It\u2019s just across the board, there\u2019s nothing; you can\u2019t get work anywhere, even the networks are closing shoots down. Even Fox Sports is stopping \u2013 there\u2019s no sport!\u201d\nDonovan was working on the Back to the Rafters reboot when the Covid-19 stop order came down. \u201cWe\u2019d spent the last couple of weeks all wondering what would happen. The producers had been doing what they can to keep us safe, the safety protocols were getting more and more stringent.\u201d Then an extra on the shoot tested positive. \u201cA whole lot of the crew had to go into self-isolation.\u201d\nLike hundreds of thousands of Australians this week, Donovan has applied to Centrelink for welfare benefits. \u201cWe\u2019re mainly sole-traders and freelancers, so most of us don\u2019t have a lot to fall back on,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re starting out, you are literally living from paycheck to paycheck. Some of my crew were in tears.\u201d\nProminent Brisbane-based production house Hoodlum has had to shut two of its key shoots, Harrow and Five Bedrooms. \u201cWe are gutted,\u201d Hoodlum\u2019s executive producer Nathan Mayfield wrote in an email.\nMayfield estimates these two closures alone will affect more than 400 cast and crew. \u201cWe take our duty of care very seriously ... we believe it is the right decision to comply in every way we can,\u201d Mayfield added. \u201cThe impacts will be felt for years to come if we don\u2019t \u2026 put the right measures in place to make sure we can all hit the ground running as soon as we can.\u201d\nAquarius Films\u2019 managing director Rachel Okine has worked for FilmFour, Hopscotch, Studiocanal and STX across a 20-year career in production. When she spoke to Guardian Australia this week, she had just had to postpone work on a TV series that was meant to go into pre-production this week. \u201cI can\u2019t go into specifics, but obviously it leaves a huge hole in cashflow for 2020,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s now a big blank space where production fees would have been.\u201d\nOkine says the uncertainty around Covid-19 has major downstream implications, too. \u201cThere\u2019s the uncertainty for us, in terms of when we can reschedule pre-production.\u201d And with crew based around the world, travel bans pose extra challenges. \u201cOur lead director is based in Los Angeles, and that makes it extra complicated. We may need to completely rethink the production methodology.\u201d\nOkine added that she was in \u201cdaily discussions\u201d with insurance firms about completion guarantees and other cover required to operate. \u201cThere\u2019s so many people affected, so many more people than I realised.\u201d\nWith production stopped and the pipeline halted, there will be much less Australian content hitting our screens in the months and years to come \u2013 to say nothing of the global situation, with major productions around the world being cancelled, distributors delaying releases and cinemas shutting their doors.\nSmaller firms are feeling it too. In Alice Springs, Rachel Clements from Brindle Films was scheduled to start pre-production of a children\u2019s series, MaveriX, in June. \u201cWe\u2019re in limbo,\u201d she said.\nThe fledgling screen sector in the Territory is particularly vulnerable to a downturn at this point, with shoots currently impossible and finance uncertain down the track. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a very emerging industry in the Territory \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of documentary makers here, everyone is scared,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we get pushed back or are unable to go into pre-production, it\u2019s going to affect the entire NT industry.\u201d\nScreen Producers Australia\u2019s Deaner is looking for a policy response from the federal government to help the industry weather the storm.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have nothing happening for quite a long time,\u201d he said. \u201cThe real challenge is how long it takes to reboot.\u201d\nScreen businesses will be able to access some of Scott Morrison\u2019s stimulus measures, and out of work cast and crew will be able to apply for Centrelink. But SPA would like to see further stimulus now to save as many productions as possible, as well as insurance guarantees and a temporary increase in production offsets to help prime the pump when the threat finally abates.\n\u201cIf we can keep the core teams together by doing some work and some production moving forward \u2013 if the clouds lift, you\u2019ve got an opportunity to roll that out.\u201d",

        "content": "Government \u2018too slow to act\u2019 and ministers have failed to lead by example, health experts say\nBoris Johnson was accused of failing to heed his own advice to the public over how to contain coronavirus on Friday as it emerged that he and other key government figures had themselves contracted Covid-19.\nOn a day of extraordinary developments at the heart of the operation to counter the virus, both the prime minister and health secretary, Matt Hancock, said they had tested positive. The chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, also reported symptoms and went into self-isolation.\nBut while Johnson said he would be able to continue to run the government\u2019s response to the crisis alone in his Downing Street flat, public health experts rounded on his attitude to the infection and accused him of being \u201cnonchalant\u201d and \u201cslow\u201d to behave appropriately.\nThe prime minister has previously been accused of failing to keep an appropriate distance from other senior figures in public, and has continued with parliamentary duties this week, raising the possibility that he may have infected others in the cabinet and beyond.\nOn another day of rapid growth in the number of deaths caused by the virus, Johnson issued a video message revealing that he had developed \u201cmild symptoms\u201d. But he added: \u201cBe in no doubt that I can continue, thanks to the wizardry of modern technology, to communicate with all my top team to lead the national fightback against coronavirus.\u201d\nJohnson\u2019s chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, was subsequently spotted running out of No 10 and along Downing Street, apparently hoping not to be noticed.\nNot long afterwards, Hancock issued his own statement saying he too had tested positive, and would be working from home. And later in the day, Prof Whitty, who had advised the prime minister to get tested, said he too was displaying symptoms.\nThe three men leading the UK\u2019s response to the pandemic \u2013 Johnson, Hancock and Whitty \u2013 must now do so from quarantine, as cases continue to surge.\nThe foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, is the designated stand-in for Johnson if the prime minister proves unable to continue with his duties, but that contingency plan has not yet been activated.\nCabinet Office minister Michael Gove announced at Friday\u2019s Downing Street press conference that another 181 people had now died from the virus, taking the total across the UK to 759.\nExperts questioned whether Johnson had been shielded from the virus effectively enough, and asked why ministers and other colleagues who have worked closely with him in recent days were not being tested.\nThe deputy chief medical officer, Dr Jenny Harries, said detailed contact-tracing was \u201cnot appropriate\u201d at this stage of the outbreak, but that the men would have been tested because of their importance to the government\u2019s response to the crisis.\nJohnson\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cNo 10 is considered a workplace. The advice to staff here and the prime minister\u2019s colleagues is that they don\u2019t need to do anything in terms of self-isolation unless they start to suspect that they have symptoms, in which case they should follow the Public Health England advice.\u201d\nDespite urging the nation in a solemn broadcast on Monday evening to \u201cstay at home\u201d where possible, Johnson continued to carry out his parliamentary duties, including prime minister\u2019s questions \u2013 though the Downing Street press briefings have been carried out by video link since Monday.\nProf Susan Michie, director of the centre for behaviour change at University College London, said: \u201cThose in leadership positions should practise what they preach. If leaders do not adhere to their own recommendations, this undermines trust in them, which in turn can undermine the population\u2019s adherence to their advice. The advice was to go to work only if essential or if you could not work from home and could guarantee your own and others\u2019 safety by keeping at least two metres apart.\n\u201cGiven the transmission routes, of touching contaminated surfaces and breathing in virus-laden droplets, it should not come as a surprise to hear that the prime minister and health secretary have tested positive.\u201d\nDr John Ashton, a former regional director of Public Health England, said: \u201cThe government has been too slow to act on this, and they\u2019ve been slow as individuals. I was surprised to see prime minister questions going ahead this week \u2013 it was clearly unnecessary.\n\u201cIt reinforces the view that lockdown measures taken earlier this week should have been taken sooner, and raises questions about the ability of people in power, including the prime minister, to discipline themselves. They should all have been more careful.\u201d\nProf Devi Sridhar, chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, said: \u201cLeaders need to lead by example. It wasn\u2019t a good thing that he was telling people that he was going around shaking hands and being quite nonchalant about the virus.\u201d\nJohnson received the result of his test at midnight, hours after he was seen outside the door of No 10 clapping in support of NHS workers alongside the chancellor, Rishi Sunak.\nBoth Johnson and Hancock have been in repeated contact with other senior political figures, including cabinet members and advisers, in the last few days. But no other ministers would be tested for the virus unless they showed symptoms, Downing Street said.\nIt is unknown how Johnson contracted the illness, but officials confirmed that other people who worked in No 10 were self-isolating after showing symptoms.\nJohnson\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cFrom the moment he had symptoms, he took steps to ensure that he wasn\u2019t in close contact with anyone.\n\u201cHe did really want to take part in clapping NHS staff. It\u2019s something he felt was important, but in taking part in that national moment he ensured he didn\u2019t come into close contact with anyone. He stood outside No 10 at a very significant distance from the chancellor.\u201d\nNo 11 Downing Street and its four-bedroom flat\u2013 previously occupied by the former prime ministers David Cameron and Tony Blair \u2013 have been sealed off from No 10 and No 12 by shutting the doors that staff and government officials usually use to move between the buildings.\nThe prime minister will work from the office usually used by the chancellor, who has given it over to Johnson during his period of isolation. It has been fitted with video-conferencing equipment.\nDuring his isolation, Johnson will have meals and work delivered to him by staff, who will knock on the door and then give him time to collect it.\nThe prime minister\u2019s spokesman would not comment on whether his partner, Carrie Symonds, who is pregnant, was in Downing Street or would be self-isolating. The recommendation for members of the household of someone who has the virus is to self-isolate for 14 days.",

        "content": "Attempts to resume the Premier League and English Football League seasons after 30 April could be thwarted by players refusing to \u00adcompete because of the coronavirus pandemic.\nPremier League, English Football League and \u00adProfessional Footballers\u2019 Association \u00ad officials held a conference call on Friday to discuss a unilateral response to the threat posed to clubs and players by the crisis, along with the prospect of resuming their seasons \u201cwhen it is safe and conditions allow\u201d. But even the possibility of playing matches behind closed doors after 30 April appears remote with players concerned about putting their health, and their \u00adfamilies\u2019 health, at risk by returning to work while the crisis continues.\nPlayers\u2019 representatives are also understood to be exploring whether insurance policies could be declared null and void should their clients contract a potentially career-\u00adthreatening illness after playing again while being aware of the risks involved.\nThe professional leagues and clubs continue to follow government advice regarding the pandemic and playing behind closed doors is one of several contingency measures being discussed. The resumption of the league seasons, future transfer \u00adwindows, player contracts that are due to expire on 30 June and wage deferrals or reductions were the main topics of Friday\u2019s conference call.\nNo decisions were taken by the three parties \u2013 the next Premier League stakeholders\u2019 meeting is scheduled for next Friday, 3 April \u2013 but there is recognition that a broad consensus is required to \u00adprevent several lower league clubs going bankrupt.\nA joint statement released on Friday read: \u201cThe Premier League, EFL and PFA met today and discussed the growing seriousness of the Covid-19 pandemic. It was stressed that the thoughts of all three organisations continue to be with everyone affected by the virus.\n\u201cThe Premier League, EFL and PFA agreed that difficult decisions will have to be taken in order to mitigate the economic impact of the current suspension of professional football in England and agreed to work together to arrive at shared solutions. The leagues will not recommence until 30 April at the earliest. They will only do so when it is safe and conditions allow. Further meetings will take place next week with a view to formulating a joint plan to deal with the difficult \u00adcircumstances facing the leagues, their clubs, players, staff and fans.\u201d\nLeeds, who are top of the Championship, agreed a wage deferral on Thursday when their manager, \u00adMarcelo Bielsa, players, coaching staff and club executives reached a deal that will protect the incomes of 272 other employees at Elland Road. Blackburn are in negotiations to follow suit. Wage deferrals must be agreed individually by clubs, rather than being imposed centrally by the EFL.\nThe Premier League is not facing the same financial pressure as EFL clubs but, while not at the same stage of considering wage deferrals, some members of the lucrative top flight believe they will have to come into play should the season remain suspended for \u00adseveral more months.\nFifpro, the world players\u2019 union, has expressed concern that clubs \u201cin more than half a dozen countries\u201d have terminated players\u2019 contracts or reduced salaries since the pandemic began. \u201cAt a time of such a significant social crisis, solutions must be found with everybody\u2019s contribution,\u201d the union said in a statement on Friday. \u201cMost football players outside the world\u2019s biggest leagues are earning at the same level or below average domestic income and would be severely affected by salary decreases.\u201d\nManchester United, meanwhile, have reiterated their commitment to completing the current Premier League season but have informed season ticket holders they can expect a pro-rata rebate or refund if matches are played behind closed doors or cancelled. The club \u201cfully supports the collective intent to complete the Premier League, FA Cup and the Uefa club competitions\u201d, it stated on Friday, following reports that a growing number of Premier League clubs want to end the campaign with immediate effect.",

        "content": "Games officials have the power to purge profiteering from elite competition and rewrite how we watch and enjoy sport\nCitius. Altius. Cancelled by a bat virus. In the end the decision to postpone the Olympic Games came as no surprise to anyone. Tokyo 2020 had struggled on manfully, like the last Japanese soldier still fighting the second world war from inside a small Pacific island copse in 1974. But there was never any doubt which way this was heading.\nGlobal plague trumps global sport every time and the degree of delay and fudge was just a function of the political and financial capital involved, the need to erect sufficient litigation-shields and anti-blame mechanisms.\nNobody wants to be the general who announces defeat.\nThe suggestion is Tokyo 2020 may now be rescheduled for spring 2021. In the meantime sympathy will be felt most keenly for the athletes, as it will for everyone else whose hopes for the future, daily routine and basic means of subsistence have been ripped apart by the Covid-19 pandemic\nStill, though. This is also a time for unvarnished truths. Whenever it does end up happening Tokyo 2020 will provide the usual mix of individual human inspiration and mild economic stimulus. But it will also \u2013 and we can say this now \u2013 be stuffed full of bullshit, revved up on the deeply phoney and self-serving Big Sport model, these four-yearly events that circle the globe like mobile city states clearing the fields, raiding the public stores, favouring the local Maharajahs with their magic dust.\nThe Olympic rescheduling is likely to cost an extra \u00a32bn, indication in itself that the whole thing was already far too big. God only knows how that might look or feel in a time of global anxiety and deep economic depression. Is this a chance to do things differently?\nIt is tempting to imagine the old certainties might just be swept away in times of macro-disaster, that there is also a kind of freedom here. During the London Blitz, George Orwell wrote about the railings coming down from the capital\u2019s private squares as the army took charge of all spare iron. Suddenly every squit and herbert and passerby could play in these previously shuttered spaces. Orwell imagined the squares staying like this, how a new egalitarianism might change life for everyone, an obsession with shared public land that also touched on his unshakable hatred of golf courses.\nThe iron railings went back up. These days the city is more opaque and unapproachable than ever before. But it doesn\u2019t have to be like this. In Big Sport, as in so many areas of life, there is an opportunity here for a mass-correction, for a step-change in what we see as acceptable. Strip it back. Flush out the murky corners. Get rid of all the things you never needed anyway. Do we have the guts and the will to make it so?\nHere\u2019s a more cheerful digression. The question for Tokyo 2020 is simple enough. Does it want to end up looking like something along the lines of the great lost Nazi Fifa World Cup of 1942, a grandiose, rather misjudged footnote, overtaken by the world falling apart around it?\nOr could it draw on the spirit and the practise of the Austerity Games of 1948, perhaps the most uplifting of all the modern Olympics, staged at a time when the world was still in chaos?\nNo new venues were built for those games. The Olympic torch came down the Thames in a rowing boat. Athletes arrived at Fenchurch Street station to be greeted by village-level bunting and were then housed eight to a room on tubular steel wartime beds.\nEveryone looked thin and pale and desperately happy to be out running and jumping around. Harrison Dillard of the USA won the men\u2019s 100m on a sodden cinder track that left him spattered with mud. Fanny Blankers-Koen won a thrilling women\u2019s sprint double but almost missed the relay final because she\u2019d popped out to buy a raincoat. The javelin took place by torchlight.\nBy all accounts it was joyful and cathartic and an experience that came from an entirely different place to the machine world of modern-day Big Sport, that profiteering global circus that constantly tells you this, sport, belongs to someone else, that it is simply a circus to be consumed at a price.\nThe Olympic Games is not the worst offender. It still offers those moments of individual inspiration. But it does also tend to amplify the vices of those who seek to stage it. Beijing was an astonishing show of nation-state power but it cost \u00a340bn and most of its venues lie rotting. Greece 2004 helped kill the local economy. London 2012 was a triumph of styling, but left behind declining participation and an ever more passive populace. Rio 2016 was a wonderful case study in elite-level corruption.\nWhy propagate this? Why allow it to be the model? Nobody really likes the way Big Sport is arranged now, apart from the small minority that stand to benefit from it.\nThere is still an opportunity to reset, to take out the chaff and the profiteering hangers-on. To revolt, for example, against Fifa\u2019s reserves of \u00a31.5bn and demand that money be given back; or to get rid of the pernicious influence of gambling sponsors (if you need gambling to be interested in sport, you\u2019re not interested in sport).\nAnd beyond this to rewrite the terms of every competition to favour inclusion and access, to ask constantly how easy is it for every member of society to play and watch and enjoy this sport.\nPeople will say this is impossible, that nothing can change. But does it really feel like that right now? Sport in the form it was intended, sport with the unhealthy additives taken away, sport in the spirit of London \u201948 and Orwell\u2019s railings. This is one thing we can still have.",

The country would see a \u201cdramatic\u201d increase in testing next week, he added.\n\u201cIncreasing our testing capacity is absolutely crucial in our response to and our fight against coronavirus,\u201d said Gove. \u201cThis is a particular priority for those who work in the health and social care sector and are working so hard to keep us all safe.\u201d\nThe increased testing capacity will be delivered by an alliance that includes Thermo Fisher Scientific, Amazon, Boots, Royal Mail and Randox, alongside the Wellcome Trust and leading universities. The antigen tests spot viral proteins in the blood and are a much quicker way of identifying whether someone has an infection. For other infections the tests can give an answer in less than an hour.\nAntigen tests are different from the antibody tests that the government said it plans to roll out as early as next week. Antibody tests are not diagnostic; they reveal whether a person has previously had an infection after they have recovered.\nSir Simon Stevens, chief executive of the NHS, said: \u201cIt is urgently important to test frontline staff who are off sick or are self-isolating. The number of tests carried out will be doubled by the end of next week compared to this week.\u201d\nIn another announcement which also underlined the pressure on the NHS, Stevens said two further NHS Nightingale hospitals would be opened amid efforts to turn London\u2019s ExCel centre into a facility that can hold up to 4,000 beds. One, based at the NEC in Birmingham, will start with up to 500 beds equipped with the capacity to increase up to 2,000 if needed. The other, based at the Manchester Central convention complex, will provide up to 500 beds but could expand to 1,000.\nThe tests for NHS employees will start with critical care doctors and nurses and other intensive care staff, as well as those in emergency departments, ambulance services and GPs. Stevens said the service would be expanded to a range of essential public workers, including those in social care services, as testing volumes increased.\nThe government has come under increasing pressure in the past week to make testing available to healthcare workers. Chaand Nagpaul, chair of the council of the British Medical Association, told parliament\u2019s health and social care select committee on Thursday that \u201clarge numbers\u201d of NHS staff were off work already with coronavirus symptoms, leaving hospital departments and GPs with serious staff shortages as the demand for care continues to rise.\nChris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, told the Guardian this week that the challenge of coping with a surge in patients in London hospitals had been exacerbated by medical staff being off with suspected coronavirus or in vulnerable groups, with 30% to 50% not at work in some trusts.\nWithout widely available testing, staff in hospitals have had to self-isolate if they or anyone in their household have Covid-19-like symptoms, including a cough or fever, even though they might not have the virus. The new testing regime would address this problem, Gove said, giving people the knowledge that they are safe to return to work if they test negative.",

He was overruled by a unanimous show of force, House leaders seeking to avoid a recorded vote so lawmakers would not be forced to return to Washington. The last-minute drama brought strong bipartisan criticism of Massie, from the White House down.\nThe legislation will deliver one-time direct payments of $1,200 to most taxpayers and substantially enhance unemployment benefits. The measure also creates a $500bn lending program for businesses, cities and states and a $367bn fund for small businesses.\nThe US has surpassed China and Italy in the number of confirmed coronavirus cases and a record 3.3 million Americans have filed for unemployment. The Senate approved the measure in an extraordinary 96-0 vote on Wednesday night.\nEarlier on Friday, Trump berated Massie, calling him a \u201cthird rate Grandstander\u201d and \u201ca disaster for America, and for the Great State of Kentucky!\u201d\n\u201cHe just wants the publicity. He can\u2019t stop it, only delay, which is both dangerous \u2026 & costly,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cWorkers & small businesses need money now in order to survive.\u201d\nTrump also heaped praise on former secretary of state John Kerry, a frequent target of his wrath, for a tweet claiming Massie \u201ctested positive for being an asshole\u201d.\nIn a series of 11 tweets, Massie, a libertarian member of the ultraconservative House Freedom Caucus, explained his rationale.\n\u201cThe constitution requires that a quorum of members be present to conduct business in the House,\u201d he said.\n\u201cRight now, millions of essential, working-class Americans are still required to go to work during this pandemic such as manufacturing line workers, healthcare professionals, pilots, grocery clerks, cooks/chefs, delivery drivers, auto mechanics and janitors (to name just a few). Is it too much to ask that the House do its job, just like the Senate did?\u201d\nA memo from the sergeant-at-arms, Paul Irving, and the House attending physician, Brian Monahan, suggested members of the chamber whose ages span from 30 to 86 consider staying home. In bolded and underlined text, they wrote: \u201cMembers should use extreme care and deliberation when making the determination to travel to Washington DC.\nEarlier, Massie dismissed concerns about legislators having to fly back to Washington, noting he chose to drive and suggesting stranded colleagues might \u201chitch a ride with a trucker\u201d.\nHis colleagues were furious. At least two House members have tested positive for coronavirus, while a number of others are awaiting test results or in quarantine after coming into contact with an infected person.\n\u201cIf you intend to delay passage of the coronavirus relief bill tomorrow morning, please advise your 428 colleagues RIGHT NOW so we can book flights and expend [more than] $200,000 in taxpayer money to counter your principled but terribly misguided stunt,\u201d the Minnesota congressman Dean Phillips tweeted late on Thursday.\nThe Republican Fred Upton, of Michigan, drove nearly 10 hours to \u201chelp get this thing over the finish line\u201d. Several lawmakers from western states said they would fly in.\n\u201cGetting on a red eye,\u201d the California congressman Mike Levin tweeted. \u201cToo much is at stake and Americans can\u2019t afford to wait any longer.\u201d\n\u201cI am jumping on the red eye tonight,\u201d the Arizona congressman Ruben Gallego, a Democrat, tweeted. \u201cThanks Massie.\u201d\n\u200bAs the crisis deepened across the country, with the US death toll rising to more than 1,200, lawmakers shared a sense of urgency. In more than three hours of debate, which began on Friday morning and was split evenly between Republicans and Democrats, lawmakers made impassioned pleas for their communities.\nCongresswoman Haley Steves, a freshman Democrat from Michigan who drove through the night to get to Washington,wore pink latex gloves to emphasize the risks faced by medical professionals combatting the virus.\nWhen her speaking time had expired, Stevens, whose district outside Detroit has been devastated by the spread of the disease and the economic fallout, began to shout over the chairman as he ruled her out of order.\n\u201cI rise for every American who is scared right now,\u200b\u201d she shouted, holding her gloves in the air as the presiding chair banged the gavel and other members joined the fray.\n\u201cYou will see darkness! You will be pushed,\u201d she said.\n\u200bMoments later the New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, whose state is at the center of the outbreak, delivered an impassioned speech on the shortcomings of the bill.\n\u201cWhat did the Senate majority fight for?\u200b\u201d she said, her arms punching the air in fury.\u200b \u201cOne of the largest corporate bailouts with as few strings as possible in American history. Shameful!\u201d\nA surreal scene today. Legislating during #COVID19. pic.twitter.com/5OuBf7Rl4P\nAs the debate came to a close, the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, asked lawmakers to assemble on the House floor and in the galleries above, typically reserved for the public, in order to ensure social distancing.\nWhen it was time to vote, a resounding \u201cYea\u201d echoed throughout the chamber. Massie was among a handful of discordant \u201cNos\u201d.\n\u201cI came here to make sure our republic doesn\u2019t die by unanimous consent,\u201d he said, demanding a roll call vote. With at least the 216 required lawmakers present, the gavel cracked and the legislation cleared the chamber.",

Last summer was the best butterfly year since 1997, the eighth best in 44 summers of scientific recording. It was good partly because 2018 was so hot.

Its arc is a mystery\nI\u2019ve been on to my solicitor to draft a certificate setting out why I should be saved when the Great Triage comes.\nI can\u2019t think of a single reason off the top of my head but he\u2019ll come up with something. He\u2019s good. He\u2019s expensive. I want the document on me when I\u2019m wheeled into ICU.\nMeanwhile, we wait. Those who matter most to us are putting their lives at risk on the frontline. Politicians are frantic. The media is in overdrive. But the rest are part of a waiting nation.\nSome of us wait at home. Some in queues. In Redfern this week, the line waiting for Centrelink to open went all the way up the street, a disciplined queue, each citizen a little apart, sitting on milk crates and cradling takeaway coffee.\nGod bless the milk crate, there for us in good times and bad \u2013 to gawp at Mardi Gras or disarm a killer rampaging round the Sydney CBD and now the crates are indispensable as we queue, perhaps endlessly, for help.\nStrange how old-fashioned the responses are to this new-fangled intruder in our lives. We\u2019re washing our hands. Grandmothers are cutting hair again. Rolled oats are in short supply. One of my in-laws is selling chooks at $35 each.\nWhat\u2019s happening is clear: the virus is taking us back to our childhoods. But a word of caution. The happy memory of hens in the garden and fresh eggs for breakfast doesn\u2019t survive much scrutiny. I know. I fed the buggers. It means a lot of work with never enough eggs. How I loved the sight of my father at the chopping block killing the chooks too old to lay.\nPity he won\u2019t be round when all this is over. There will be work. But when will that time come? We haven\u2019t a clue. The most remarkable thing about these remarkable times is having so little idea when and where this story will take us. Its arc is a mystery.\nThe virus is reminding us how much time and energy we spend predicting the future. We do it automatically. And despite the twists and turns that catch us off guard, we humans are pretty good at working out what\u2019s coming down the track. It\u2019s how we survive.\nBut not this time.\nThat\u2019s why the virus has overwhelmed the news cycle. With the future so uncertain we can\u2019t tear ourselves away. We keep reading and watching and listening though the story wasn\u2019t different this morning and will be the same tomorrow \u2013 the same yet new.\nMind you, the old are beginning to tire. \u201cI\u2019m so sick of the news,\u201d a celebrated whinger raged at me the other day. \u201cTwenty-five minutes of coronavirus and then the weather. It\u2019s not enough. What about a murder every now and again \u2026\u201d\nThe mysteries of the future are throwing politics in the air. Politics divides over the best way to deal with reasonably predictable outcomes. Politicians and commentators throw the words unprecedented around all the time. But it\u2019s rarely justified. Now it is.\nPoliticians are feeling their way forward into the unknown. Old divisions are all but meaningless. There\u2019s no left or right way to approach this catastrophe. There\u2019s only doing it badly or getting it right.\nSo we\u2019re seeing an extraordinary sight I can\u2019t remember in my lifetime: conservative governments making radical choices and spending huge sums of money to address a national crisis.\nHow trivial this makes the politics of the last decade seem, all those years conservatives spent blocking solutions to that other great challenge we face. It\u2019s too expensive to do anything about climate change, they said. Too daring. Too disruptive. So they deliberately pursued the politics of logjam.\nBut now the purse is open. Extraordinary demands are being made of the country. And perhaps, in the end, it will work. The great lesson of the coronavirus may well be that we have it within our grasp to address and solve the problems of this country.\nThat would change Australia, a nation that\u2019s grown increasingly pessimistic over recent years about the possibilities of politics and increasingly reluctant to demand political solutions to the problems we face in the future.\nPerhaps the culture wars might be abandoned at the same time out of sheer pointlessness. It\u2019s sweet to see the panic merchants of the media \u2013 those who revved up the nation about refugees and Indigenous land rights and transgender kids and the high price of doing anything about climate change \u2013 urging calm in the face of the virus, calm and trust in the government.\nWe wait. One day we will tell stories about being there when handshaking stopped; when we held our breath passing people in the street; when cruise ships roamed the seas; when the Minister for Keeping Out Foreign Contagion came down with the bug; and, for a couple of days, Bondi beach was closed while Crown Casino stayed open.\nWe all have friends waiting on milk crates and know grandparents in exile from their families. With dry coughs and breathlessness, the pandemic has also brought loneliness and, of course, ruin everywhere.\nThe business of a woman I know has gone kaput and 15 employees are facing the sack. She\u2019s a big figure in her trade. She\u2019s always grown vegetables as a hobby but you should see her garden now. It\u2019s never been so planted, weeded and fed. It\u2019s a picture.\nOver the road, friends of friends are hunkered down for a fortnight\u2019s self-isolation. The prisoners sit with their little girl in the doorway and their families gather at the gate. They bring picnic chairs and, of course, takeaway coffee.\nThey\u2019re learning not to kiss and hug. It isn\u2019t easy. Worse, we all find, is learning to stand a little apart. It feels so awkward, so cold, so wrong.\nA woman known for her extreme attitudes on a number of fronts has stood apart rather dramatically by retreating to the remote hinterland of Canberra where she is running her business from a tent pitched in a paddock. \u201cFrom here,\u201d she explained, \u201cI get line of sight to the Telstra tower.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a reassuring lesson for capitalism here. From that great distance, even though they are scattered to their own homes, she is still able to terrify her staff.\nI\u2019m working from home as I always have. As usual, I sit in a bubble of good fortune. But I\u2019m getting on.

Some still have to work while their kids are not in school. She has been going to the supermarket pretty much every day for the past two weeks, buying loads of groceries.\n\u201cI have been helping her get the care packages ready for delivery.

If everyone does their best to stay hygienic, follow the guidelines, then hopefully Wimbledon has a chance of going ahead. But I have no idea if that will be the case or not.\u201d\nSwan, languishing at 256 in the world and keen to return to the Tour, added, \u201cI know the WTA, ITF and ATP are working hard to do their best. Nobody could have predicted this. I have no idea how the system is going to change or if it will change.\n\u201cI am trying to take all the positives out of this. I had my 21st birthday on Tuesday.

        "content": "The security council is struggling to function as the US defies secretary general\u2019s advice and Russia probes for political gain\nIn the face of a truly global crisis, the world\u2019s highest deliberative body, the UN security council, has been paralysed by squabbling among the major powers.\nThe 15-member council has not even been able to muster a joint statement on combating the spread of the coronavirus \u2013 in part because of US insistence that it should stress the Chinese origins of the pathogen, which was unacceptable to other states, not least China.\nA draft statement would have echoed the calls from the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, for a global ceasefire in view of the pandemic.\nThe US has also ignored Guterres\u2019 calls for sanctions to be suspended on vulnerable countries. Over the past week, Washington has intensified punitive action against Iran and Venezuela. At the same time, Russia has blocked an attempt to hold virtual security council sessions by video conference.\n\u201cIn the current circumstances, it is important to show to the rest of the world that UN and its security council are functioning,\u201d the Russian ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, wrote to his Chinese counterpart, who had proposed video conferences.\nThe letter was first reported by Foreign Policy. The Russians have allowed some video conferences to go ahead but have insisted they be counted as informal consultations rather than formal sessions.\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be afraid to gather from time to time in the UNSC chamber. After all the preventive measures taken by the secretary general, the UN is one of the safest venues in NYC, and the risk of getting the virus there is much lower than when we go to a shop for basic needs,\u201d Nebenzia argued.\nOther council members did not share his assessment of the health risks, and were suspicious of Russian motives.\n\u201cI thought, initially, it was a Russian macho thing \u2013 and it may have been at first \u2013 but it looks like it might be tactical,\u201d one security council diplomat said. \u201cThey like being on the security council, but they don\u2019t like being called to account for their behaviour in Syria, Libya, Central African Republic, etc. So they\u2019ll enjoy the break.\u201d\nThe UN\u2019s general assembly can step in where the security council has failed, and is currently considering a resolution to uphold the organisation\u2019s central role in fighting the pandemic and to ensure that \u201cthere is no place for any form of discrimination, racism and xenophobia in the response to the pandemic\u201d.\nBut some diplomats voiced concern that if the security council becomes less visible at the height of the pandemic, it will lose its centrality as an arena in which the world\u2019s most powerful governments are held to account.\n\u201cIf there aren\u2019t meetings on things like Syria now, it makes it easier for them not to happen and easier to make the UNSC a less important global meeting once we come back,\u201d said the security council diplomat, who suggested that could be Russia\u2019s long-term aim. \u201cI think they\u2019ll see if they can reshape the world order to their benefit.\u201d",

        "content": "How do you adapt to working from home, keep fit, maintain a social life \u2013 and maybe even cut your hair?\nSocial media is awash with professional colourists pleading with absent clients not to reach for the box dye while they\u2019re closed for business. This is partly because, like every service profession, hairdressing will take a financial beating during this crisis.\nBut professionals are also genuinely worried about their clients\u2019 hair, and tell me they\u2019re bracing themselves for a plethora of complex colour correction appointments when they finally reopen. \u201cColour correction can be a long, drawn-out and expensive process,\u201d warns Luke Hersheson, my own stylist and creative director of Hershesons in London. \u201cUntil we know when salons might reopen, it\u2019s much safer to use a temporary fix, like a root touch-up spray or powder that shampoos out,\u201d he says.\nHe believes many women can buy a few more weeks by just changing where they part their hair. There\u2019s usually more grey at the temples, so a centre parting is a good stopgap.\nTop salon colourist Josh Wood isn\u2019t against box dyes \u2013 he even sells them under the Josh Wood Colour brand in Boots. However, the secret to a successful home dye job, he says, is in knowing your limitations. \u201cNow is not the time to transform the colour of your hair, or for tricky techniques like balayage, ombre or bleaching,\u201d he says.\nRetouching roots or toning existing colour should be the extent of your ambition as an amateur. Wood suggests applying a moisturising hair mask a couple of days before colouring, and \u201calways choosing dye in one shade lighter than you think you need from the picture\u201d, as too dark is impossible to correct. Follow the box instructions to the letter, Wood says, \u201cstarting at the greyest point \u2013 usually the front \u2013 and cover roots for twice the length of time as the lengths\u201d. He suggests enlisting your spouse or teen to do the back.\nIn any case, you must always, always do a skin test in advance, according to instructions, to minimise the risk of potentially serious allergic reaction. It can be a lifesaver.\nHersheson (whose team, like Wood\u2019s, is offering video consultations during the crisis) points out that it\u2019s worth considering whether social isolation might be a good opportunity to push through the pain barrier of transitioning to grey. \u201cIt\u2019s also a good time to grow out an unwanted fringe \u2013 you can clip it back and not worry about how that looks, and not have the stress of trimming it yourself,\u201d he says.\nHersheson counsels against trimming your fringe, unless you\u2019re very adept. But I have trimmed dozens of fringes in extremis, and if you think you\u2019re up to the job, here\u2019s my own technique:\nAlways start with clean, but dry hair \u2013 never, ever cut when wet or even damp. Clip back the rest of your hair, leaving the dry fringe isolated and loose.\nComb through, and with the comb, gather the entire fringe into a single, flat, one-inch section at the very centre of your forehead.\nClamp it between two flat fingers at the bottom of the section, approximately 1cm from the hair tips (use a plastic freezer bag clip instead, if you prefer).\nTake the sharpest scissors you own and cut up into the one-inch section of tips, naturally stopping at the fingers. Do not cut across, only upwards. When you\u2019ve snipped the entire inch-wide section, release your fingers and comb through to assess the length, snipping away any single hairs you may have missed.\nIf it\u2019s still too long (always preferable to too short), repeat the process, nudging fingers up only half a centimetre at a time, before combing through and checking.\nNot only is it eminently possible to maintain your friendships under lockdown, talking to people other than those you live and work with is highly advisable if you are to emerge with your sanity intact. Our social lives\u2019 pivot to video just means a bit more planning.\nIf it\u2019s a large group you are trying to meet with, you can gauge everyone\u2019s availability using the easy web scheduling tool Doodle.\nThe best platform to use is probably the one the majority of people already have an account with. If everyone is using an iPhone or Apple computer, use FaceTime. WhatsApp permits video calls with up to four participants but, without calling on WhatsApp Web, ties you to your phone.\nFor many, Skype is a tried and trusted classic that supports up to 50 participants \u2013 though rarely seamlessly. Otherwise, most people have a Google account, making Hangouts a straightforward choice.\nThe video conferencing platform Zoom, which has seen its shares spike since the coronavirus outbreak, limits free group calls to 40 minutes \u2013 but you can always call back.\nNo matter the platform , some lagging audio and frozen faces are inevitable, especially for large groups. Adding some structure \u2013 such as a book club, quiz or a table-top role-playing game such as Dungeons & Dragons can be helpful in adjusting to an unfamiliar medium and minimising people talking over each other.\nThe Houseparty app might be geared more towards younger groups, having been a fad among kids a few years ago. But now it seems to be a royal platform of choice. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing, I just press a button and all my family pop up,\u201d the Duchess of Cornwall reportedly told a friend. The app can alert you when your friends are online, allowing you to effectively drop in on them. It also has in-built games, for up to eight players at a time.\nSome people have ramped up, or perhaps rediscovered, their love of gaming as a means of socialising at a distance, with popular games such as Minecraft, Fortnite and Call of Duty all allowing some in-play communication. It is also possible to play board games online, such as at Board Game Arena and \u2013 for the more hardcore \u2013 Tabletop Simulator.\nFor a more relaxed interaction \u2013 and one that does not demand that you broadcast your face \u2013 Netflix Party is a Google Chrome extension that permits you to sync your streaming with friends, like a remote movie night.\nEvery longtime freelancer knows the secret to effective working from home: put your shoes on. It\u2019s really effective in cueing the mindset shift from \u201chome is where the couch is\u201d to \u201cproductivity ninja\u201d.\nThe goal is to create a distinction, even one that is mostly symbolic, between work mode and home mode, \u2013 especially now that you cannot go anywhere else. Setting up a home office, if only a dedicated corner of your kitchen table, that you can arrive at and leave at the day\u2019s end will help (do make sure you leave).\nYour new colleagues may also take some adjusting-to. Novelist Julie Cohen shared on Twitter her top tip for working around family, care of her marriage counsellor: a literal work hat. \u201cTrain everyone (and yourself) that when you\u2019re wearing The Work Hat, they should leave you alone. (And when you\u2019re wearing it, you should only work),\u201d she tweeted. It will be a talking point on all those video-conferencing calls, too.\nBe aware that whatever is visible behind you on your webcam will be under close scrutiny from your colleagues, and inform their judgments of your home, taste and private life. Style accordingly.\nThose more used to finding their focus in the informal-formality of a cafe or library are now seeking to replicate the effect at home. Gretchen McCulloch, linguist and author of Because The Internet, tweeted that her current strategy was \u201cmellow cafe songs playlist \u2026 With coffee and sitting in a different part of my apartment than usual,\u201d recommending an additional background of an eight-hour YouTube stream of Magical Tearoom ASMR Ambience. With the sound of teaspoons tinkling on saucers and hissing espresso machines over gentle indie music, you won\u2019t believe it\u2019s not Starbucks.\nYou can even fudge together your own overly sweet frappuccino concoction. On the video platform Tik Tok, enterprising teenagers have been filming themselves making \u201cdalgona\u201d coffee to replicate cafe coffee at home. It is easy to make, if high in caffeine and wasteful of milk: mix equal parts instant coffee, boiling water and sugar \u2013 about two tbsp per person \u2013 and whisk. Add more sugar to taste. Once the mixture is stiff and glossy, pour over milk and ice, stir and serve. And whisk it by hand, even if you have an electric maker. It takes ages; the morning will fly by.\nThere is no shortage of material online about how to stay fit at home \u2013 if anything, the proliferation is the problem. Choice is deadly to motivation, so start by trying to whittle down your options.\nWhat do you want to do each day, and how long do you want to do it for? 15 minutes is reasonable, 30 shows a bit more backbone. It\u2019s more habit-forming to do some every day than an hour twice a week.\nThere are whole-week programmes, such as the book Be Para Fit, or Canadian Air Force Exercises, available on YouTube, that build in your rest days. You can also follow a particular person; Joe Wicks is the obvious one, Adrienne for yoga, and they\u2019ll do a daily workout which will make your decisions for you.\nIf you\u2019re of a more independent bent, do a timetable more like a classic cardio/resistance workout for two days, yoga on the third day, cardio/resistance the fourth, something fun like a dance routine on the fifth, resistance on its own for the sixth, yoga on the seventh.\nIf you used to do regular classes, check to see if they\u2019ve gone online; a live-streamed pilates class, at a fixed time, is much more conducive to discipline than roaming freely round WikiHow, trying to find some illustrations that look a bit like your instructor. If you already have some equipment in the house \u2013 resistance bands, a skipping rope, a mat, a multi-function Fitt Cube \u2013 you can build your own workouts around those. I would really recommend buying a mat, which you\u2019ll need for all floor work.\nFind the online instructor who irritates you least: over time, it\u2019ll be a love-hate pendulum, but if you find their voice grating at the start, that\u2019s never going to work. If you\u2019re feeling nostalgic, almost all the classic workouts \u2013 Cindy Crawford, Mr Motivator, Rosemary Conley \u2013 are on YouTube.\nIf you find all people basically annoying, there are some brilliant illustrated resources like DAREBEE Workouts. If you find it hard to watch and move at the same time, choose one workout and repeat it: after a week, you\u2019ll be doing it from memory, which is good for morale. Swap it over after a fortnight, though, as there\u2019s evidence that you build fitness faster when you do things you\u2019re inept at.\nJust because there\u2019s no professional asking you whether you have any injuries does not mean you can ignore your injuries. Look up first what to avoid with an gammy knee or similar, rather than typing \u201croutines for one rubbish knee\u201d into Google.\nThe single most important thing is: don\u2019t wait until you feel like it \u2013 wait long enough, and you\u2019ll never feel like it. In the words of the prophet Joe Wicks, the bit where you feel good is at the end of the workout, not the beginning.",

Typically deployed to provide disaster relief, the ship has fully equipped operating rooms, a 1,000-bed hospital facility, a medical laboratory, a pharmacy, and a landing deck for military helicopters.\nSpeaking from an afternoon press conference, with navy ships as a backdrop, California\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, said the Mercy was fully staffed and operational with 800 medical staffers and 12 operating rooms. It would be ready to start taking patients as early as tomorrow, Newsom said.\nThe Los Angeles mayor, Eric Garcetti, joining Newsom at the press conference, said the ship would increase available hospital beds by two-thirds across Los Angeles and become the city\u2019s largest hospital.\nThe ship arrived as Los Angeles prepares for a surge in cases similar to those now overwhelming hospitals in New York.\nConservative estimates indicate California will have a caseload comparable to New York\u2019s within 12 days, while the most aggressive say that could occur within five days, Garcetti said.\n\u201cEither way, we will have doctors making excruciating decisions on how to deal with that surge. That\u2019s the rate of increase we are seeing now,\u201d added the mayor.\nHe said the Mercy will act as a \u201cCovid-19-free bubble\u201d, serving patients unrelated to the outbreak to free up room at other hospitals in the city for critical care.\n\u201cThis ship is full of angels in a city of angels,\u201d Garcetti said. \u201cEvery bed not taken in Los Angeles will mean one more bed for the surge.\u201d\nThe Mercy\u2019s admiral said the ship would serve as a \u201crelief valve\u201d that allows other hospitals to focus on treating Covid-19 patients.\nWhile New York remains ground zero for the fight against the virus, with more than half the nation\u2019s coronavirus cases, cases in California are ballooning. As of Friday afternoon, more than 4,500 cases were confirmed statewide, with 1,400 in Los Angeles alone.\nNewsom has said the state needs to add 50,000 hospital beds to meet the projected demand. About 30,000 of those beds will come from the state\u2019s hospital system. The remaining 20,000 will be cobbled together through various sources such as the Mercy ship and field hospitals.\nState leaders hustling to find shelter for the unhoused have located 4,666 hotel rooms. Garcetti said Los Angeles would receive 637 trailers from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to be used for shelter.\nNewsom also announced on Friday a temporary statewide ban on evictions for those who have lost work or pay due to the coronavirus crisis. The order prevents landlords from evicting tenants for not paying rent, and extends through 31 May.\nRenters are still required to pay owed rent and have to notify their landlords in writing within a week of a missed payment, according to the governor\u2019s executive order.\nThe coronavirus is already wreaking havoc on the US economy with a particularly staggering effect on California, the world\u2019s fifth-largest economy. Newsom said this week that more than 1 million Californians had filed for unemployment since March 13.\nThe state\u2019s unemployment department has seen 108,000 unemployment claims a day, he added, up from 2,000 claims on a typical day before the pandemic took hold.\nThe state\u2019s 40 million residents are currently under lockdown orders to leave their homes only for essential services and exercise, and the governor called on Californians to continue to observe physical distancing guidelines. Officials have closed beaches and parking lots across the state, which have become especially crowded on weekends, and Newsom urged residents to do their part.",

The taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, said on Friday evening that people should stay at home for two weeks.\nAfter many delays, and then a series of tweets earlier today, Donald Trump announced he was invoking the Defense Production Act to compel General Motors to build ventilators for hospitals.\nFollowing the news that the prime minister, Boris Johnson, had tested positive for Covid-19, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, confirmed that he too has coronavirus. Both are experiencing mild symptoms and are in self-isolation. The chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, says he is also experiencing symptoms and has gone into isolation.\nTests for healthcare workers in the UK will be rolled out next week, allowing them to find out whether they have been infected or are safe to work, the British government has announced.\nSocial distancing appears to be keeping the coronavirus at bay in British Columbia \u2014 a rare moment of positive news as cases around the world continue to surge. The daily rate of growth of coronavirus cases in the Canadian province has been cut from 24% to 12%, far lower than that of China and Italy during their severe outbreaks.\nBrazil\u2019s polemicist president Jair Bolsonaro has sparked further outrage by insinuating that the number of coronavirus cases is being inflated for political purposes and declaring: \u201cSome people will die. I\u2019m sorry. That\u2019s life.\u201d\nThousands of Australians caught by India\u2019s dramatic nationwide shutdown say they face running out of food and water or being evicted from accommodation, as 1.3 billion people across the world\u2019s second most populous nation are ordered to stay indoors.\nIn the UK, the Principality stadium in Wales is to be converted into a temporary hospital providing around 2,000 additional beds to support the NHS.\nVirgin Atlantic is applying for hundreds of millions of pounds in state aid to keep afloat during the coronavirus crisis, after the chancellor told the stricken aviation sector this week he would consider assisting firms on a case-by-case basis.",

Everyone who needs one?\u201d He also hurled abuse at state governors and complained bitterly that he feels unappreciated by them.\nFor weeks the president seemed reluctant to enforce the Defense Production Act (DPA), which grants him power to require companies to expand industrial production of key materials or products. He claimed it smacked of nationalising free enterprise and even drew comparisons with the socialist government of Venezuela.\nBut officials say he did use it on 18 March, when he signed an order prioritising contracts and allocating resources to the US health secretary, Alex Azar, and again on 23 March, when he signed an order to prevent people from hoarding health and medical resources.\nThe third instance, an order compelling GM to begin manufacturing ventilators, was the most far-reaching as Trump came under criticism from state governors, Democrats and doctors for playing down a nationwide shortage of ventilators. \u201cGM was wasting time,\u201d Trump said in a statement. \u201cToday\u2019s action will help ensure the quick production of ventilators that will save American lives.\u201d\nCovid-19 is a respiratory illness. Most who contract it recover but it can be fatal, particularly among older people and those with underlying health problems. Ventilators enable a person with compromised lungs to keep breathing.\nSome observers suggested Trump had acted out of spite after a long feud with GM. At the White House, he complained that \u201cwe thought we had a deal\u201d with GM \u201cand I guess they thought otherwise. They didn\u2019t agree, and now they do \u2026 We let them know the way we felt and they can\u2019t be doing that.\u201d\nHe went on to list a series of grievances with GM, including its building of plants outside the US, adding: \u201cWe thought we had a deal for 40,000 ventilators, and all of a sudden it became six, and then price became a big object \u2026 We didn\u2019t want to play games with them.\u201d\nThe moved followed a series of tweets earlier on Friday in which Trump lambasted GM\u2019s chief executive and its closure and sale of a car assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio. This stood in sharp contrast to a message sent in May last year, praising the decision to sell.\nAfter Trump invoked the act, GM said it had been working around the clock for more than a week with Ventec Life Systems, a medical device company, and parts suppliers to build more ventilators. The company\u2019s commitment to build Ventec\u2019s ventilators \u201chas never wavered\u201d, it said.\nTrump also announced that the White House trade adviser Peter Navarro would become the national DPA policy coordinator for the federal government. Navarro has been a leading advocate of Trump\u2019s protectionist trade agenda, championing tariffs against China and the European Union.\nNavarro told reporters: \u201cWe cannot afford to lose a single day, particularly over the next 30 to 60 days.\u201d\nThe House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, welcomed Trump\u2019s use of the DPA as \u201can important but seriously belated step\u201d. She added in a statement on Friday: \u201cMuch more must be done. The president must use the full powers of this law to address the dire, widespread shortage of materials required to fight this pandemic, including diagnostic test supplies, masks and other personal protective equipment.\u201d\nCritics say Trump ignored early warnings about the threat of the pandemic and had he acted sooner, mass production of ventilators would now be well under way. The New York Times reported estimates that if the White House had reacted to the shortage in February, the private sector might have had them ready in mid- to late April; instead it is now unlikely to be before June.\nTrump\u2019s call for the building of more ventilators comes one day after he expressed scepticism about New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and medical experts\u2019 prediction that his state would need 30,000 to 40,000 ventilators when the coronavirus outbreak peaks there.\nOn Friday Trump refused to back down on his comments, saying: \u201cI think their estimates are high. I hope they\u2019re high.\u201d\nHe suggested the ventilators produced by GM and others would serve not only New York but other parts of the US was well as helping the UK, Italy, Germany and Spain. When he called Boris Johnson, the British prime minister, who has tested positive for the virus, Johnson immediately said, \u201cWe need ventilators,\u201d Trump recalled. \u201cWe\u2019ll take care of our needs but we\u2019re also going to take care of other countries.\u201d\nDuring Friday\u2019s briefing, Trump also lashed out at state governors. \u201cAll I want them to do, very simple, I want them to be appreciative. I don\u2019t want them to say things that aren\u2019t true. I want them to be appreciative. We\u2019ve done a great job.\u201d\nHe described Jay Inslee, the governor of Washington, as a \u201cfailed presidential candidate\u201d and dismissively referred to Governor Gretchen Whitmer as \u201cthe woman in Michigan\u201d.\nTrump said of the vice-president, Mike Pence: \u201cHe calls all the governors. I tell him, I\u2019m a different type of person, I say: \u2018Mike, Don\u2019t call the governor of Washington. You\u2019re wasting your time. Don\u2019t call the woman in Michigan.\u2019 You know what I say? If they don\u2019t treat you right, I don\u2019t call.\u201d\nIn another bizarre moment, when Trump was asked for a message to schoolchildren forced to stay at home, he said: \u201cYou can call it a germ, a flu, a virus, you can call it many things. I\u2019m not sure people know what it is.\u201d Scientists have identified it as coronavirus disease (Covid-19), an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus called Sars-CoV-2.\nIn another sign that Trump is not living up to his appeal for bipartisanship, Trump did not invite Pelosi or any other Democrats to the signing of a $2.2tn emergency relief bill. Pelosi said in a statement on Friday: \u201cWe must do more to address the health emergency, mitigate the economic damage, and provide for a strong recovery.\u201d",

        "content": "Two people have tested positive for coronavirus and four have died on the Zaandam luxury cruise liner\nPassengers on a cruise ship stranded off the coast of Panama have issued a desperate plea to be allowed to dock after four people died during a covid-19 outbreak on board.\nTwo people have tested positive for the disease and dozens are ill with flu-like symptoms on the Zaandam luxury cruise liner, which has not been able to dock after several Latin American countries closed their ports in response to the global pandemic.\nHundreds of North American, Australian and British citizens are in isolation in their rooms and a boat-to-boat operation is underway to move some healthy travellers to a sister ship, the Rotterdam, over the weekend.\nBut there are fears that sick, elderly passengers and crew members will be left stranded at sea during a global pandemic, with some on board isolating in small, humid cabins with no natural light or fresh air.\nHolland America Line, which owns the cruise ship, confirmed on Friday that four elderly passengers had died onboard. It is not clear whether they died after catching Covid-19.\n\u201cUnfortunately, four of our fellow guests have passed away \u2013 one last night, two yesterday and one a few days ago,\u201d the ship\u2019s captain Captain Jan Smit said in an announcement, which was obtained by The Guardian. \u201cWe are still seeing both guests and crew with symptoms reporting to the medical center. The situation continues to grow more challenging each day.\u201d\nPanamanian authorities have refused to let the Zaandam cruise liner pass through the canal in Central America to attempt dock in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Chile and Argentina have also refused to let the cruise ship enter port, which departed Punta Arenas in Chile on 14 March.\nRick de Pinho, a passenger on the ship with his wife Wendy, told the Guardian: \u201cLife on the boat took a serious turn when our captain asked us to return and stay in our cabins on March 22 around 2pm ship time.\n\u201cMeals were delivered three times a day and initially included hot meals but that seems to no longer be the case.\u201d\n\u201cWhile we scraped together the pieces of information, no one was really prepared to learn that four had passed away. It\u2019s one of those moments when you realise the severity of the situation. While we are holding up well I truly was bothered to see my wife\u2019s eyes tearing up.\u201d\nPassenger Laura Gabaroni Huergo of Florida has been issuing pleas for government assistance for days from the cabin she\u2019s sharing with her husband, but she said the bad news announced on the ship Friday left her speechless and fearful.\nWe\u2019ve \u201cnot heard any details about where we go from here,\u201d she said in a message to the Guardian. \u201cWe are waiting and hoping that all the parties involved will do the right thing, for both the ill and the healthy.\u201d\nMany on board the Zaandam have only been able to pass messages via Whatsapp or through family members due to poor internet connection. Before passengers are allowed to move to the Rotterdam, which brought supplies and Covid-19 test kits to the stranded boat, travellers are screened for illness but many are not passing the tests.\n\u201cPeople are being screened on the basis of a medical questionnaire and if anyone has had a cough, cold, fever, runny nose, breathing problems, headaches or sore throat within the last 10 days, then they fail the medical. Lots of people are bound to have had non related coughs, colds, etc., during this time, so many are failing the medical,\u201d one woman on board explained.\nThe wife of one of the 85 crew members in isolation with flu-like symptoms on the Zaandam expressed concerns about the conditions for staff.\n\u201cThose who are confined were quarantined in a five square metre cabin, given only three small pieces of bread and a small amount of cereals,\u201d she said, adding there is a lack of water, fresh air and two people are confined to each cabin room.\nThe Guardian was also contacted by an NHS doctor whose mother and aunt are on the Zaandam, who was scared her loved ones were being left \u201cstranded at sea\u201d while she cared for people back in the UK.\n\u201cThey are being left onboard scared and anxious. They have not stepped foot on land for over 2 weeks. My mum had an existing cough and for this reason she was refused on the rescue boat and kept on the \u2018sick ship\u2019 Zaandam. They are so close to land and just want to get home. Can someone not help them like I am helping others?\u201d she told the Guardian.\nThe Zaandam, is just one of at least 10 ships stuck at sea as of Thursday-- carrying nearly 10,000 passengers \u2013 around the globe, after having been turned away from their destination ports in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic, a Guardian analysis of ship tracking data has found.\nIn a statement on Friday, Holland America Line said that once healthy passengers had been moved to the Rotterdam, the company planned to sail both cruise ships to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, keeping all passengers in isolation on both ships.\nBut when contacted by the Guardian, Broward County authorities in Florida said it had not yet received a formal request for docking from Holland America, nor has a plan been worked out with the federal and state health officials.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very scary,\u201d said Broward County Commissioner Michael Udine Friday. \u201cWe are waiting for a plan to be presented to us.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe that the Panama Canal people will let their employees get on a ship with coronavirus in order to get it through the canal,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a sticky situation.\u201d\nHe said, before the county commission could approve a docking in Fort Lauderdale \u201cwe would need to be sure that it is safe for the residents of South Florida\u201d.\n\u201cRemember, we\u2019re already a hotspot,\u201d said Udine, noting that hospitals in Broward County are already filling up with Covid-19 patients and running short of medical supplies. \u201cIt would be difficult for us if 1500 people (potentially needing treatment) just got off the ship.\u201d\nIn a statement, the Panama Canal said that all journeys through the system required their staff to board ships and restrictions on ships with Covid-19 outbreaks were in place to protect workers.\nPanama is battling the largest outbreak in the region, with 786 cases and 14 deaths as of Friday.\nThe British Foreign Office said they are doing \u201call they can\u201d to help citizens on board and are in close contact with the cruise operator and authorities in the region.",

        "content": "Hundreds of health workers will be stood down unless governments help pay for them to stay open for future Covid-19 needs\nA leading healthcare operator has warned dozens of private hospitals across the country will be forced to close over the next week, standing down thousands of health workers, unless governments help replace the revenue lost when elective surgery was banned.\nHealthe Care, Australia\u2019s third biggest private hospital operator, told its workforce on Thursday that \u201ca considerable portion\u201d of them would be stood down on half pay for at least four weeks because governments had cancelled all non-urgent elective surgery as it sought to limit the spread of coronavirus.\nPrivate hospital industry associations said other providers would follow, and a failure by state governments to support them would have dire consequences for national health capacity as the pandemic worsened. \nIn a letter to staff seen by Guardian Australia, Healthe Care\u2019s head of speciality services, Julia Bellamy, said the company had been forced into a shutdown period.\n\u201cDue to the escalating Covid-19 pandemic and its impact on our business we find ourselves having to make some very difficult decisions which are completely outside our control,\u201d she said.\nThe company\u2019s chief executive, Steve Atkins, told Guardian Australia the prime minister, Scott Morrison, caught private hospitals by surprise when he announced on Wednesday that non-urgent elective surgery would be banned from midnight that night.\nHe said it would not be difficult for private providers to do a deal with public hospitals to support them during the crisis, but they needed urgent government help so they could stay open until they were required.\nAtkins said Healthe Care, which owns 34 hospitals and employs 8,000 staff in eastern states, generated about 70% of its revenue from elective surgery. The other 30% had begun to decline as people stayed home and private hospitals responded to calls to save dwindling supplies of protective equipment for urgent cases.\n\u201cWe\u2019re sort of between a rock and a hard place when our revenue has been cancelled on us without notice,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re hopeful that the states and other providers and us will get an other arrangement in place promptly, but if this doesn\u2019t happen soon what we have seen [with staff being stood down] in the last few days will be a small impact compared with what we will see in the next week once elective surgery stops completely.\u201d\nAtkins\u2019s statement was supported in a joint statement by the Australian Private Hospitals Association, Catholic Health Australia and Day Hospitals Australia.\nThe groups called on the states and territories to deal with concerns raised by the federal health minister, Greg Hunt, as part of a national coronavirus partnership on Wednesday, and guarantee the viability of the private sector in return for a guarantee all hospitals would be geared to treat the virus.\nMichael Roff, from the Australian Private Hospitals Association, said negotiations with states and territories had been fragmented. \u201cThe states don\u2019t seem to understand the urgency of reaching a deal this weekend. If they don\u2019t do that the beds they need in a few weeks\u2019 time may no longer be available,\u201d he said.\nThe Catholic Health Association\u2019s Pat Garcia said all hospitals should be using the time before the \u201cfull coronavirus onslaught\u201d to train existing clinical staff and hire additional staff. \u201cHospitals cannot simply close down entire wards and ICUs then turn them back on at the flick of a switch,\u201d he said.\nHunt said the national cabinet, made up of the prime minister, state premiers and territory chief ministers, had committed on Friday to urgently finalising agreements with private hospitals to ensure they had \u201csufficient and viable\u201d capacity during the pandemic and once it was over.\nHe said it was an \u201castonishing breach of faith\u201d that a private health provider would let nurses go at a critical time of need. \u201cI urge the state and territory governments to complete whole-of-sector agreements with the private hospital sector in the timeframes agreed at national cabinet,\u201d Hunt said.\nBrett Holmes, general secretary of the NSW Nurses and Midwives\u2019 Association, estimated more than 600 nurses across the state had been stood down since Thursday night and hundreds more could follow. He accused the federal government of bungling the announcement of the elective surgery ban.\nThe government announced on Wednesday that all non-urgent surgery except for category 1 (operations classified as required within 30 days) and urgent category 2 (procedures required within 90 days) would be postponed from midnight that day.\nThe start of the ban was later pushed to 1 April. Holmes said the biggest private operator, Ramsay Health Care, stopped non-urgent surgery on Friday.\n\u201cThere doesn\u2019t seem to have been a lot of forethought of the consequences of sending people on leave and laying them off and, when the shit has hit the fan in four weeks\u2019 time, relying on them coming back into what will be a pretty daunting situation,\u201d Holmes said.\nThe Victorian health minister, Jenny Mikakos, said the state was working to secure an agreement. \u201cThe private healthcare sector in Victoria has, and will continue to be, an important and integral component of Victoria\u2019s healthcare system.\u201d she said.\nA NSW Health spokeswoman said it was talking to private hospital operators \u201cfocusing on how private hospitals can help support the health system with their facilities and workforce\u201d.",

        "content": "Activists say pattern of increasing abuse is repeated in countries from Brazil to Germany, China to Greece\nAround the world, as cities have gone into lockdown to stop the spread of coronavirus, the mass efforts to save lives have put one vulnerable group more at risk.\nWomen and children who live with domestic violence have no escape from their abusers during quarantine, and from Brazil to Germany, Italy to China, activists and survivors say they are already seeing an alarming rise in abuse.\nIn Hubei province, the heart of the initial coronavirus outbreak, domestic violence reports to police more than tripled in one county alone during the lockdown in February, from 47 last year to 162 this year, activists told local media.\n\u201cThe epidemic has had a huge impact on domestic violence,\u201d Wan Fei, a retired police officer who founded a charity campaigning against abuse, told Sixth Tone website. \u201cAccording to our statistics, 90% of the causes of violence [in this period] are related to the Covid-19 epidemic.\u201d\nIt is a pattern being repeated globally. In Brazil a state-run drop-in centre has already seen a surge in cases it attributes to coronavirus isolation, the Brazilian broadcaster Globo said.\n\u201cWe think there has been a rise of 40% or 50%, and there was already really big demand,\u201d said Adriana Mello, a Rio de Janeiro judge specialising in domestic violence. \u201cWe need to stay calm in order to tackle this difficulty we are now facing.\u201d\nThe Catalan regional government said that calls to its helpline had risen by 20% in the first few days of the confinement period; in Cyprus, calls to a similar hotline rose 30% in the week after 9 March, when the island had its first confirmed case of coronavirus.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a dramatic rise and it has only gone up,\u201d said Annita Draka, of the association for the prevention of domestic violence, which is based in Nicosia, the island\u2019s capital. \u201cIt\u2019s a 24-hour helpline and the calls come in all the time.\u201d\nThose alarming figures log only cases where women are able to seek help; many cannot make calls because they fear being overheard by abusive partners, or are stopped from leaving home.\nIn Italy activists said calls to helplines had dropped sharply, but instead they were receiving desperate text messages and emails.\n\u201cOne message was from a woman who had locked herself in the bathroom and wrote to ask for help,\u201d said Lella Palladino, from EVA Cooperativa, an activists\u2019 group for the prevention of violence against women. \u201cFor sure there is an overwhelming emergency right now. There is more desperation as women can\u2019t go out.\u201d\nPalladino said she expected to see an \u201cexplosive increase\u201d in the number of reports of domestic abuse once the lockdown restrictions eased.\nMara Bevilaqua, an activist for the Casa Lucha y Siesta shelter in Rome, said all shelters were open and they were looking out for women trying to get in touch by any means. \u201cWe\u2019re all ensuring that channels of communication are kept open,\u201d she said. \u201cOur mobile phone is active all the time and women can also contact us by email and Facebook.\u201d\nIn Spain \u2013 where lockdown rules are extremely strict, and many people are being fined for breaking them \u2013 the government has told women they will not be fined if they leave home to report abuse.\nBut on 19 March, the country saw the first domestic violence fatality since the lockdown began five days earlier, when a woman was murdered by her husband in front of their children in the coastal province of Valencia.\nThe increased threat to women and children was a predictable side effect of the coronavirus lockdowns, said activists. Increased abuse is a pattern repeated in many emergencies, whether conflict, economic crisis or during disease outbreaks, although the quarantine rules pose a particularly grave challenge.\n\u201cIt happens in all crisis situations,\u201d said Marcy Hersh, a senior manager for humanitarian advocacy at Women Deliver. \u201cWhat we worry about is just as rates of violence are on the rise, the accessibility of services and the ability of women to access these services will decrease. This is a real challenge.\u201d\nIn many countries there have been calls for legal or policy changes to reflect the increased risk to women and children in quarantine.\nIn the UK, Mandu Reid, leader of the Women\u2019s Equality party, has called for special police powers to evict perpetrators from homes for the duration of the lockdown, and for authorities to waive court fees for the protection orders.\nA prosecutor in Trento, Italy, has ruled that in situations of domestic violence the abuser must leave the family home and not the victim, a decision hailed as \u201cfundamental\u201d by the trade union CGIL.\n\u201cBeing confined to home because of coronavirus is difficult for everyone, but it becomes a real nightmare for female victims of gender-based violence,\u201d the union said in a statement.\nIn Germany the Green party\u2019s parliamentary leader, Katrin G\u00f6ring-Eckardt, said this week she feared for the lives of thousands of women trapped with violent partners, and called on the government to free up money for safe houses.\n\u201cThe spaces in safe houses for women are tight even during normal times,\u201d she told German media, and urged authorities to consider transforming empty hotels and guest houses, and lift conditions on leaving home for women who are vulnerable.\nHer deputy, Katja D\u00f6rner, said house visits should continue in cases where there was suspicion that children were being maltreated, despite rules banning contact.\nPolice in India\u2019s Uttar Pradesh state, which has one of the worst track records on violence against women in the country, have launched a new domestic violence helpline as cases surge.\n\u201cSuppress corona, not your voice,\u201d read an advertisement on the front page of one newspaper. Police promised a female officer would handle each case, and police could arrest the perpetrator of any violence.\nIn Greece, officials said they were stepping up a campaign to help women deal with problems clearly emerging from the issue of confinement.\n\u201cRecognising that, generally, in times of crisis this is a problem, we are working around the clock to get the word out,\u201d said Maria Syrengela, who heads the general secretariat for family policy and gender equality.\n\u201cOnce official figures are released next week, and we know the true scale of the problem, we\u2019ll be enlisting TV channels as well as social media and the mainstream press. There is no question in my mind that with the economic impact of the crisis this will get worse.\u201d\nKate Connolly in Berlin, Sam Jones in Madrid, Tom Phillips in  S\u00e3o Paulo, Lily Kuo in Beijing and Annie Kelly also contributed reporting",

Another boatload of passengers did the same on 8 March.\nOn Tuesday NSW Health revealed there were 11 cases in Western Australia, nine in Queensland, three in Tasmania, two in the Northern Territory and one in the ACT linked to the ship.\nBut on Friday the NSW department said it would stop \u201cproviding any more national or interstate figures, just our NSW figures\u201d, despite the rise in interstate cases.\nIn South Australia cases from the Ruby Princess are the single biggest cluster of coronavirus cases, making up a fifth of the state\u2019s total.\nThree Queenslanders who were on board the ship told Guardian Australia they were expecting to be tested but had been texted while on the ship to \u201cdisembark\u201d and board a bus to Sydney airport.\nThe daughter of one of the passengers, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said her mother and two friends had all tested positive for Covid-19 since leaving Sydney.\n\u201cWe all assumed they would have to stay on the ship until cleared,\u201d she said. \u201cMy mum and friends thought this would be the case also.\n\u201cNext thing we know, we all receive a text saying that all passengers had to disembark and were put on a bus to Sydney airport with nothing more than a leaflet instructing them to self-isolate upon arriving home.\n\u201cMy father, who does not leave home due to his health, made the choice and effort to pick Mum up from the airport [in Queensland] as he didn\u2019t want to risk anyone else\u2019s health.\u201d\nThe passenger\u2019s daughter said her father had also contracted Covid-19.\n\u201cThis should never have happened,\u201d she said. \u201cHow many people have these passengers encountered on their return home to isolate? Our medical staff in this country are working tirelessly and risking their health [and] this situation was avoidable.\u201d\nOn Saturday the NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard, said it had been a mistake to allow the 2,700 passengers to disembark on 19 March without testing.\nOn Thursday it emerged that the NSW Port Authority had been warned as early as January by the Maritime Union of Australia of \u201ca gaping hole\u201d in biosecurity networks when it came to coronavirus.\nA Queensland Health spokesman said: \u201cAll other passengers have been given clear direction from Queensland Health to quarantine themselves for 14 days and phone ahead before attending their GP or attend a local fever clinic should they develop symptoms.\u201d\nEarlier this week a spokesman for Princess Cruises said: \u201cOur onboard medical team was rigorous in its treatment of some guests who reported flu-like symptoms, and these guests were isolated.\n\u201cThe ship reported these cases to NSW Health, which in turn requested swabs to be provided following the ship\u2019s arrival in Sydney, some of which subsequently tested positive for Covid-19.\u201d\nOn Tuesday NSW Health said in a public statement: \u201cNo cases of Covid-19 had been identified by doctors on board before docking.\u201d",

The fatalities took the country\u2019s death toll to 9,134 while the total number of cases topped 86,400, second only to the US, according to Johns Hopkins University. The head of Italy\u2019s national health institute warned that infections had not yet reached their peak and lockdown measures would have to be extended.\nIn an attempt to contain community transmission, Australian states have implemented fines, closed beaches and threatened stricter measures if people defy pleas to stay at home. The death toll from the virus rose to 14 after an elderly woman died in an aged-care facility in New South Wales, where several residents and employees have tested positive.\nSouth Korea reported 146 new coronavirus cases on Friday, the highest number in a week, its disease control agency said on Saturday, with the country suffering a rise in imported cases from Europe and the United States during recent days.\nChina\u2019s National Health Commission said on Saturday that 54 new coronavirus cases were reported on the mainland on Friday, all involving so-called imported cases.

By Friday night there were more than 6,000 hospitalised Covid-19 patients in New York with almost 1,600 in intensive care while the state had logged 519 deaths, the most in the US, and more than 44,000 infections.\nHospitals in New York City, New Orleans, Detroit and other virus hotspots have sounded the alarm about scarcities of drugs, medical supplies and trained staff.\n\u201cThis is going to be weeks and weeks and weeks,\u201d the New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, told members of the National Guard working at the Javits convention centre which has been converted to hospital. \u201cThis is going to be a long day, and it\u2019s going to be a hard day, and it\u2019s going to be an ugly day, and it\u2019s going to be a sad day.\u201d\nIn California a navy hospital ship, the Mercy, has docked at the Port of Los Angeles to provide 1,000 beds and full medical facilities \u2013 freeing up hospitals on land for seriously ill coronavirus patients, as the state braces for an outbreak potentially on New York\u2019s scale.\nThe president on Friday invoked a national security law compelling General Motors (GM) to mass produce ventilators \u2013 accompanied by barbs that the carmaker had not been acting quickly enough. Some saw it as partly an act of spite amid Trump\u2019s continuing feud with the company \u2013 GM said it had already been working around the clock for more than a week to help build more ventilators.\nItaly became the second country to overtake China in terms of the number of infections, reaching more than 86,000 cases. Its latest 969 deaths represent the highest national one-day figure anywhere since the outbreak began, seemingly dashing hopes that Italy might be flattening its rate of infection.\nSouth Korea reported 146 new coronavirus cases on Friday, the highest number in a week, its disease control agency said. Officials said they were \u201cimported\u201d cases: infected people who had arrived from Europe and the United States during recent days.\nChina\u2019s National Health Commission said on Saturday that 54 new coronavirus infections had been reported on the mainland on Friday, all involving so-called imported cases. There were 55 new cases a day earlier. The total number of infections for mainland China stood at 81,394 with the death toll rising by three to 3,295, the commission said.\nThe number of coronavirus deaths in the UK has risen sharply from 578 to 759, the country\u2019s biggest day-on-day increase to date.\nPassengers on a cruise ship stranded off the coast of Panama have issued a plea to be allowed to dock after four people died on board. It was not yet known on Friday whether the deaths were coronavirus-related but two people tested positive on the Zaandam, operated by Holland America Line, while dozens were taken ill with flu-like symptoms. Hundreds of North American, Australian and British citizens were in isolation in their rooms as a boat-to-boat operation began to move some healthy travellers to a sister ship, the Rotterdam, throughout the weekend. Panamanian authorities were refusing to let the Zaandam pass through the canal to reach Fort Lauderdale, Florida, after other countries including Chile and Argentina turned it away.\nAround the world, quarantine and lockdown conditions have caused a rise in domestic violence. In Hubei province, China, domestic violence reports to police more than tripled in one county during February, activists said. In Spain the Catalan regional government said calls to its helpline had risen by 20% while Italian crisis centres said they were fielding desperate text messages and emails. \u201cOne message was from a woman who had locked herself in the bathroom and wrote to ask for help,\u201d said Lella Palladino, president of D.i.Re, the Women against Violence Network. \u201cThere is more desperation as women can\u2019t go out.\u201d",

Half of the YouGov poll sample reported that they were self-isolating, and 53% of NHS workers were worried about getting food.\nHalf of parents on low incomes with children eligible for free school meals said they had not yet received any substitute meals to keep their children fed, despite government promises to provide food vouchers or parcels. Around 830,000 children are therefore likely to be going without daily sustenance.\nOf those surveyed, 12% \u2013 representative of 6.1 million adults \u2013 said they were struggling to follow the government order to stay at home because they had to keep earning to survive.\nThe scale of financial and food insecurity is revealed by the numbers reporting that they had already had to borrow money to survive, just a week into the lockdown. Of those surveyed, 6% had taken out personal loans. Households with children were two and a half times more likely to have borrowed than those without.\nYouGov polled 2,070 adults on 25 and 26 March. The figures have been weighted and are representative of all adults in Britain.\nOn 21 March the government instructed people at greater risk of Covid-19 to stay in their homes and self-isolate for 12 weeks. It said it would contact 1.5 million people in this category and set up a system with local authorities, voluntary organisations and business to deliver food parcels to the homes of those who lacked family support.\nMilitary planners have been assigned to work with councils, but the Guardian understands that the scheme is not yet running and will take a few weeks to scale up to supplying food to 400,000 people. The Food Foundation has calculated that more than twice that number \u2013 860,000 people who fall into the medically vulnerable category \u2013 were suffering from food insecurity even before the crisis.\nMichael Gove, minister for the Cabinet Office, said at Friday\u2019s daily briefing that the government was working across departments to make sure food could be distributed to the vulnerable with the help of businesses and volunteers.\nAnna Taylor, director of the Food Foundation, said the problem could not be solved by the voluntary sector alone and called on the government to coordinate emergency food aid immediately. \u201cOur poll results suggest people are already going hungry. There are at least five government departments which have responsibility for aspects of the food response,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWe need a food aid task force, led by a single minister, to conduct a comprehensive assessment of need and coordinate across government, with local authorities, businesses and charities to deliver the right package of food and financial assistance. We cannot afford to delay.\u201d\nThe Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government is responsible for overseeing emergency planning around food; the Department for Education is responsible for action on free school meals; the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is negotiating with the food industry over supplies to food banks; and the Department for Work and Pensions has responsibility for getting money through universal credit to those who have lost work and cannot afford to eat.\nThe government has been approached for comment.",

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.\u00a0Learn more.\nYou have to hand it to Rian Johnson. To go from directing a Star Wars franchise entry to trying out a genre widely perceived as having had its heyday in the 1930s is the kind of risk more blockbuster directors should take. Better yet, it paid off: with more than \u00a3260m in the bank, Knives Out proved that there\u2019s life yet in the dusty old country-house mystery. Naturally, a sequel has already been greenlit.\nThe Guardian\u2019s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.\u00a0Learn more.\nThe film, available on streaming and DVD this week, is lively, limber entertainment for a quarantined night in. The spirit of Agatha Christie is strong in this jazzy old-school whodunnit revolving around a dead mystery writer, his bewildered Latina nurse and his money-grubbing family \u2013 all investigated by Daniel Craig\u2019s peculiarly southern-fried gumshoe \u2013 though its modern twist of Trump-era class politics finds fresh crannies of meaning in its classic family mansion location.\nThe manor house has long been an ideal hothouse for storytellers seeking to amp up tensions \u2013 social, romantic, homicidal \u2013 between a motley array of characters. There needn\u2019t always be a mystery element: Jean Renoir\u2019s scalpel-sharp comedy of manners The Rules of the Game (streaming on BFI Player) has all those aforementioned conflicts, but its streak of blood is almost wickedly incidental.\nIts DNA is equally present in Johnson\u2019s romp, but one\u2019s mind goes first to the out-and-out murder mysteries, beginning with cinema\u2019s many and varied Christie adaptations. None is more pure than the 1945 version of And Then There Were None, directed by Frenchman Rene Clair in the last of his Hollywood ventures. Beyond its reliance on the racist nursery rhyme that gave Christie\u2019s book its original title, it\u2019s one of Christie\u2019s most macabre, playfully contrived narratives, as eight strangers answer an invitation to a remote Devon getaway \u2013 and get picked off one by one. With a splendid cast of golden-age character actors, it\u2019s tighter and nervier than the campy all-star Christie extravaganzas of later decades. And it\u2019s in the public domain, so easy to find on YouTube.\nYou can\u2019t leave out The Hound of the Baskervilles, can you? Basil Rathbone remains the ideal screen Sherlock Holmes, and his first outing in the role \u2013 in this smoky 1939 adaptation of the Conan Doyle chestnut, uncovering the real killer in a Dartmoor mansion supposedly cursed by a canine demon \u2013 was his best. Or dip into a different franchise: in the 1930s and 1940s, more than 40 B-movies centred on intrepid Hawaiian detective Charlie Chan, but 1934\u2019s Charlie Chan in London was the one foray into classic country-house territory. Also on YouTube, it\u2019s an antiquated hoot.\nIt also plays a background role in Robert Altman\u2019s supremely chic addition to the genre, 2001\u2019s Oscar-winning Gosford Park (on iTunes), which mined its Christie-esque set-up for piquant upstairs-downstairs social satire in a comparable way to Knives Out. It spawned Downton Abbey, of course, but is still far tarter and cleverer than that legacy suggests, with its vast dream cast on imperious form.\nFinally, if you\u2019re in a sillier mood, few genres are quite so ripe for parody. The 1976 adaptation of Neil Simon\u2019s Murder By Death (on Chili), with none other than Truman Capote commanding proceedings as a mysterious aristocrat inviting a variety of knockoff famous detectives \u2013 including, unfortunately, Peter Sellers as a kind of Lidl Charlie Chan \u2013 is loopy fun, but it doesn\u2019t quite scale the soaring camp peaks of 1985\u2019s bananas boardgame adaptation Clue (on NowTV), which is worth a stream for Madeline Kahn\u2019s hysterical Mrs White alone. It makes Knives Out look austerely serious, but it\u2019s perfectly delirious viewing for when your own cabin fever sets in.\nHoney Boy (Sony, 15) \n This Shia LaBeouf-scripted reflection on the star\u2019s own troubled childhood and daddy issues is no minor vanity project, thanks to Alma Har\u2019el\u2019s tangy, inspired direction and a lead performance of prodigious wit and sensitivity by Noah Jupe.\nFrozen II (Disney, U) \n Disney\u2019s handsome, mega-hyped sequel may now be the highest-grossing animated film of all time, but it\u2019ll never have quite the cultural footprint of its predecessor: kids won\u2019t carp, but the story lacks shape and the songs don\u2019t stick.\nFor Sama (Channel 4, 18) \n  Long available to stream, Waad Al-Kateab and Edward Watts\u2019s shattering, Bafta-winning first-person Syrian survival diary now arrives on physical media: it\u2019s an essential film in any format.\nMotherless Brooklyn (Warner Bros, 15) \n Edward Norton\u2019s adaptation of Jonathan Lethem\u2019s New York noir is unequal to its ambition: beginning with its odd transposition of the narrative to the 1950s, few of its grandest creative gambits come off.\nThe French Lieutenant\u2019s Woman(Sony, 12)Harold Pinter\u2019s metatextual, time-hopping 1981 adaptation of the John Fowles novel was rather ingenious, but its tricksiness hasn\u2019t aged all that freshly: now released in the Criterion Collection, it\u2019s an arch, elegant museum piece.",

Staff and student deaths. Fires, floods, students with weapons. I\u2019ve had threats from the English Defence League. But there have always been support teams behind me with advice. This crisis is different.\nIn the past week we have had to tell distraught and fearful year 11 and year 13 students that there will be no exams this summer \u2013 without a plan for what will happen instead. We had a partial shutdown as people self-isolated. Now we have the school lockdown that is not a lockdown \u2013 it is a guessing game of how many students will come in. We\u2019ve gone from 1,500 students to five. Who knows about next week, or the week after?\nMy school is in an area in which few doctors live, but we have nurses, binmen, transport workers. We\u2019ve hastily cobbled together numbers we can expect, plus all the children with additional needs and an education and health care plan (EHCP) or who have a social worker. We have planned for about 100 children. Just 21 arrive. We attempt to get them logged on to Hegarty Maths, a popular website. But the rest of the country is trying to do the same, and our school internet cannot cope. We move to the library instead.\nOf our nearly 100 staff, about 70% come in. We all try to keep a distance. After a couple of hours of planning, we send most home, but not everyone wants to go.\nSome teachers have stood at my office door coughing, asking: \u201cWhat shall I do?\u201d It is as if they are frozen into helplessless and only the headteacher can authorise their illness. I send them home.\nToday I am trying to arrange how the children entitled to free school meals will eat over the coming weeks. Many come from families struggling for food and I am so worried about them \u2013 the children who normally eat proper food only in school. I am ensuring the building is deep-cleaned and figuring out which staff need to self-isolate for seven days, for 14 days, or even indefinitely.\nWhen I get home I sleep for three hours on the sofa, dribbling and unable to respond to my own daughter. She has done nothing educational today at home with her dad, unless you count TikTok. If I can\u2019t enforce a decent education for my own daughter, what hope have I for the rest?\nToday even fewer children come in \u2013 just nine. They are happy enough and are enjoying the activities. One of our most vulnerable year 7 students, who had been managing only two hours a day after a long period of school-refusing, did the whole of yesterday, does the whole of today, and I actually see him smiling. For him, this could be the best thing that has happened.\nI attempt to Skype with my senior team. After an hour of technological frustration we return to sending one another memes on WhatsApp; at least we can still make one another laugh. These are the people who will get me through, an incredibly dedicated group of professionals who, even when working at home, understand one another and the concept of relentless optimism. Knowing those you rely on most have got your back is a godsend.\nToday we have just five children. Once I\u2019ve welcomed them, sent the attendance information off to both the Department for Education and the local authority (they are battling it out as to who needs this information) and checked in with the skeleton crew, there is time to breathe.\nToday a number of us are phoning vulnerable families \u2013 checking they have enough to eat, are coping with the lockdown, that they still have gas and electricity. Yesterday one of my team visited a home to put \u00a320 on the family\u2019s PayPoint card, paying for electricity to keep them going for a few days. She also bought them food basics such as bread and milk. I know colleagues in more affluent schools who have parents emailing for university-level extension tasks. Here the calls are about food vouchers. The coronavirus has made the societal differences across the country more glaring.\nThe vouchers we have sent to families with children eligible for free school meals have arrived in some homes but not others, probably owing to a disrupted postal service. We posted them to avoid having hundreds of parents turning up at school, but we are inundated with calls from those who have not yet had them.\nAt least three have moved without telling the school, several want a set of vouchers per parent as \u201cwe share custody\u201d, and one mum has moved into an emergency refuge.\nIt feels as if we are trying to solve all of society\u2019s ills. In the end, I go to Tesco myself and buy as many vouchers as I can put on my own credit card, inviting the neediest in, one at a time, to collect.\nToday we have 12 children and I am expecting the numbers to rise as soon as those who went into 14-day isolations start to come out. Some parents call to say they can\u2019t cope and they want to send their children back in for respite. It is difficult trying to explain that we can\u2019t do this. Every child in school needs adult supervision and every member of staff I ask to come in is another I\u2019m putting at risk. The majority of the children we are supervising have special needs and respond best to their regular teaching assistants, most of whom are more mature women. It is a vicious catch-22.\nI\u2019m exhausted and miserable and deeply scared for so many children. The ones on the edges of gang life, at risk of exploitation, in unsafe homes, and with little food in the cupboard. I shut my blinds, hide in the corner, have a cry and then pull myself together.\nOne of our most vulnerable children, who is in foster care, has created a PowerPoint about happiness and he wants to share it with me. It\u2019s touching. When we have the bandwidth, I\u2019ll share it with the whole staff.",

Here are some of the significant advances this week.\nCheap, reliable antibody tests that reveal whether someone has previously had Covid-19 are viewed as crucial for managing the next phase of the pandemic. Population-level screening can gauge the overall level of immunity and can allow people to incrementally return to work. Various teams around the world are already using lab-based antibody testing, but this is challenging to scale up, partly because the tests need to be performed a few weeks after infection. In parallel, companies have been working on home-testing kits that work something like a pregnancy test. This week, the UK government signalled it thought such tests could be reliable enough, announcing it had bought 3.5m testing kits, with a view to making them available first to healthcare workers, and then to the public through high street chemists or Amazon delivery. An unnamed prototype is being validated in Oxford this week and the proposal still hinges on the tests\u2019 performance. \u201cThe one thing that is worse than no test is a bad test,\u201d Chris Whitty, England\u2019s chief medical officer, said on Wednesday. In Spain, the government was forced to withdraw 9,000 Chinese-made coronavirus testing kits from use after it emerged that they had an accurate detection rate of just 30%.\nAnecdotal reports have been circulating for weeks that Covid-19 can cause people to lose their sense of smell. This week, the idea gained credibility with the British Association of Otorhinolaryngology suggesting that so-called anosmia could be a useful symptom for screening for the virus, based on reports from South Korea, China and Italy, and higher than usual numbers reporting the complaint in UK clinics. On Monday, World Health Organization officials also said they were also looking into the possible link. \u201cWe are reaching out to a number of countries and looking at the cases that have already been reported to see if this is a common feature,\u201d said Maria Van Kerkhove, the head of the WHO\u2019s emerging diseases and zoonoses unit. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the answer to that yet.\u201d\nThe good news is that even if the coronavirus kills off some of your olfactory cells, the nose lining contains stem cells to make replacements. \u201cColleagues in Italy report encouraging rates of recovery, with many patients reporting return of sense of smell within seven to 14 days,\u201d the British association advises. \u201cThis seems to be the experience of patients in the UK.\u201d\nCoronaviruses, in general, don\u2019t tend to mutate rapidly and this week scientists provided further reassurance that this is true for Covid-19. A team at Johns Hopkins University analysed 1,000 samples and, according to the Washington Post, found only four to 10 genetic differences between the strains circulating in the US and the original virus that was isolated from patients in Wuhan. An Italian analysis, also out this week, reached similar conclusions. This suggests that if an effective vaccine is found it should continue to work for some time. However, there is still an open question about how stable the human immune response is to Covid-19, and whether people who are infected once will be protected against reinfection long into the future.\nHopes that life could get back to normal some time soon were dampened this week with models suggesting that lockdown measures need to remain in place for months to have their intended effect. A paper published in the Lancet suggested that if controls in Wuhan had been relaxed in early March, when case numbers dramatically dropped, the city would already be ramping up towards a fresh outbreak in June. China\u2019s decision to maintain its lockdown until early April was estimated to reduce the average number of new infections by the end of 2020 by 24%. The restrictions currently in place in the UK will be reviewed on 13 April.\nEvidence is growing that men are more likely to die from the disease than women. This was first observed in China, where the fatality rate was around 2.8% for men and 1.7% for women and the pattern has been mirrored as successive countries have released data. This week Spain reported that around twice as many men as women had died. The difference was initially put down to high rates of male smoking in China \u2013 about half of men smoke compared with just 2% of women. However, as the same trend has been replicated in countries with more equal proportions of male and female smokers, scientists are starting to consider other possibilities, including that women\u2019s immune systems may be better able to overcome the virus. Serological studies from China, tracking the immune response throughout the course of infection, should soon start to provide some answers about why men appear more vulnerable and whether behaviour, lifestyle factors or biology is the leading factor.",

Similar provisions to those in the act were contained in a previous law that was declared unconstitutional in 2005.\nBarishaki said it \u201cdefies logic as to why parliament would rush to pass an act of parliament containing provisions that are pari materia [the same] with those that were declared unconstitutional\u201d.\nThe police used the law to brutally disperse rallies organised by opposition politician Kizza Besigye in the lead-up to the 2016 elections, and more recently to block meetings and concerts by pop star turned politician Bobi Wine.\nIn a tweet, Besigye said: \u201cCongratulations @nickopiyo & the petitioners for this important court decision nullifying Uganda\u2019s obnoxious POMA Law! Without rule of law however, Uganda police will continue to act with impunity (as it did before this law was made) but without a false cover. Shame on Uganda parliament.\u201d\nDr Livingstone Sewanyana, executive director of the Foundation for Human Rights Initiative, welcomed the ruling, saying it had been \u201can obstacle to the enjoyment of the right to freedom of expression, association and assembly in Uganda\u201d.\n\u201cGranting unfettered powers to police to deny, disperse and block meetings had a chilling effect on the democratic rights of Ugandans, particularly the political opposition, human rights defenders and activists,\u201d he said.\nDeprose Muchena, Amnesty International\u2019s director for east and southern Africa, said the law had been used as a tool of repression.\n\u201cUnder this law police have brutally dispersed spontaneous demonstrations and opposition rallies, while opposition politicians have been beaten up and arrested simply for exercising their rights,\u201d she said, adding that Ugandan lawmakers must now repeal the entire act, which contradicted the constitution, ahead of next year\u2019s presidential elections.\nIn January, police arrested Wine and fired teargas at his supporters when he tried to hold a rally to mark his 2021 presidential bid.\nSince he became a legislator in 2017, Wine has rattled Ugandan authorities, who see him as a threat to President Yoweri Museveni. Museveni has been in power since 1986.\nJoel Ssenyonyi, spokesperson for Wine\u2019s People Power Movement, said he was concerned that the ruling would be ignored. \u201cThis government is notorious for disregarding court orders,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe are hoping this shall not be disregarded, [that] it shall take effect and also that parliament will not run again and create another law like they did previously.\u201d\nSarah Kasande, of the International Centre for Transitional Justice, said the move \u201cwill open up space for political activists and human rights defenders to exercise their rights to peacefully assemble, and to debate public policies and advocate for change\u201d.\nSewanyana said: \u201cIf people are allowed to speak up, assemble and demonstrate freely, a new political dispensation will be born, giving rise to transformative leadership in the country that is needed more than ever before to counter the new threats once Covid-19 is contained.\u201d Uganda has 18 confirmed cases.",

It could happen as early as next week. The situation is increasingly alarming.\u201d\nScotland\u2019s prisons are badly overcrowded, creating the perfect environment for virus transmission. As of Friday, the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) confirmed that 111 individuals across 10 establishments were self-isolating.\nThe UK justice secretary, Robert Buckland, said on Tuesday he was considering temporary release as one of a number of options to mitigate the public health crisis in English prisons, after campaigners warned that prisoners with health issues were \u201cfacing death sentences\u201d.\nThere are currently two mechanisms available for early release in Scotland \u2013 home detention curfew which is almost always used for prisoners sentenced to under four years, and temporary release towards the end of a longer sentence.\nBut Yousaf added that the Scottish government would be considering whether further powers for emergency release were necessary ahead of Holyrood\u2019s own emergency powers bill, which will be debated this Wednesday.\nHe added: \u201cTo reassure the public, this would be done with the appropriate risk assessments in place, we\u2019re talking about people that would be towards the end of their sentences.\u201d\nLast Monday, the SPS suspended all family visits which the Scottish Prisoner Advocacy and Research Collective (SPARC) warned is detrimental to the mental health of those in custody as well as their loved ones.\nSPARC has called for the provision of free stationery, phone credit and tablets so all prisoners can make use of video-calls during the health crisis, alongside a lifting of the ban on mobile phones. Non-internet enabled mobile phones are already being distributed in prisons in England and Wales.\nWriting for the Scottish centre for Crime and Justice Research, Dr Cara Jardine of the University of Strathclyde called on the Scottish government to take radical action, but cautioned: \u201cReducing the prison population through early release will require careful planning, coordination between agencies, and likely additional funding alongside wider government support. Criminal justice reform in Scotland has tended to be incremental, particularly with regard to prisons, and despite prolonged efforts to bring down our prison population, it has remained stubbornly high.\u201d\nDespite the Scottish government\u2019s emphasis on \u201csmart justice\u201d, which last year saw the extension of a presumption against short-term sentences to 12 months, the prison population remains the second highest in western Europe.\nLast October, Europe\u2019s anti-torture watchdog warned of \u201cemergency\u201d conditions, in a damning report that highlighted the overuse of segregation, and inmates confined to their cells for lengthy periods of time, sometimes in less than 3 sq metres of living space.",

        "content": "Barry John, a mixture of Machiavelli and Napoleon, bamboozled and outplayed one of the strongest clubs in Britain with his match-winning brilliance\nThere are many images of Barry John, but a personal favourite is of the outside-half sitting on the ball where the touchline met the 22 on the side of the main stand as Cardiff slid towards defeat against a club that was then one of the strongest in Britain. He wore the insouciance of someone watching his dog retrieve a stick as he waited for a Coventry player to revive from the ministration of what passed then for a medic, someone armed with a bucket of water and a sponge. It took a while and, with Cardiff having been awarded a penalty, the opposition retreated behind their line in readiness for John\u2019s attempt at goal.\nThere did not seem much to concern them, leading 15-3 against a side they had beaten 22-10 at Coundon Road the previous September. They fielded seven England internationals with two other players, Peter Preece and Geoff Evans, winning their first caps later in the year. Cardiff had two asterisks, but what a pair, John and his half-back partner Gareth Edwards. They had only recently returned to action after a long lay-off following the successful Lions tour to New Zealand. It was not a vintage period for the Arms Park club whose vet captain John James did not play all season after jabbing himself with cow vaccine.\nBut they had John, in his prime at 27. He was to make his final break four months later \u2013 for freedom after feeling trapped by fame having been hailed as the King after his return from New Zealand and treated with royal reverence. While Edwards was a player who tended to reserve his best for Wales and, protecting his hamstrings, ration his club appearances, John treated each match the same, there to be won, by whatever means it took.\nAs he sat on the ball, he plotted. Part of the reason that made him stand out was that he thought a few moves ahead of everyone, a mixture of Machiavelli and Napoleon whose slight frame disguised his fierce competitiveness. As the spongeman made his way off the field, John slowly rose to his feet and addressed the referee, who nodded in response. Casually, he bent down to address the ball before tapping it and running to the line as his opponents, who had not checked whether he had indicated he was going for goal, gawped incredulously.\nHe showed his mortality by missing the conversion, but the crowd sensed the turning of the tide and became vocal. Cardiff\u2019s pack, full of gnarled forwards who either just failed to get a Wales cap or, in the case of the second row Ian Robinson, collected two in 1974, got on top. Four of the Coventry team had been part of the England side that had collapsed next door the year before and they had a feeling of deja vu as John\u2019s boot put Cardiff in front on a day when he went through the card.\nAnd then came the coup de grace. Few club matches were televised then, confining most of John\u2019s feats with Cardiff to memory, which can play tricks, but the sight of his making an arcing run to the spot where he traded a penalty for a try remains indelibly imprinted. It became clear, as three defenders converged on him, that he was not going to make it but still he went on. At the point just before the three pounced on him, he passed blindly out of the back of his right hand. Chugging up in support, the No 8 Carl Smith did not have to break his stride, only catch the ball with the defence occupied elsewhere.\nIt was only a friendly, but the reaction to the 22-15 victory was as if a league had been won. A week later, John and Edwards were at Twickenham, helping Wales to victory over England, another day, another collar.",

Isolate. Don\u2019t be around people, and [for] people that are in recovery, that\u2019s like a recipe for disaster,\u201d said Denny Kolsch, a licensed mental health counselor, who is in recovery, and founded a mental health and addiction treatment facility in Florida.\nAlthough it\u2019s only been a few weeks since local and state governments in the United States started taking drastic measures to limit the spread of the virus, health professionals have already seen relapses or near-relapses as people experience more urges and cravings to use drugs and alcohol.\nKolsch said one person relapsed on fentanyl and heroin after losing their new job when their workplace suddenly shuttered. And in every group therapy session over the last two weeks, the conversation has turned to Covid-19 \u2013 \u201cEvery single one of \u2019em,\u201d Kolsch said.\nElie G Aoun, a psychiatrist who serves as vice-chair of the American Psychiatric Association\u2019s council on addiction psychiatry, was surprised to discover that one of his patients had filled a prescription for oxycodone even as he was prescribing a treatment for addiction to the drug.\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying that this is because of the coronavirus crisis, but the social distancing and the isolation that this person was experiencing is what he used as an excuse to justify why he did that,\u201d Aoun said.\nOn the flip side, mental health professionals feared that people would be forced into abstinence because of supply chain disruptions, potentially suffering lethal withdrawals or overdosing when they use again.\nUnder normal circumstances, Americans dealing with addiction rely heavily on their community and routine for support when they decide to get sober. But now, there\u2019s no gym, no coffees with friends or sponsors, and few in-person gatherings.\nWorkers, meanwhile, are getting laid off in droves, and some people are spending most of their day cooped up with their significant others, sometimes while fighting or experiencing abuse.\nOthers are completely on their own. One of Aoun\u2019s patients, who is sitting at home not talking to anyone, is feeling more and more depressed, a major trigger for his alcohol use and gambling, Aoun said.\nAndrea St Clair, a mental health and substance use disorder professional at an outpatient program in Seattle, worried about people who may be missing even the most mundane interactions such as handshakes or hugs.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s definitely a time where people are subject to having more thoughts, more triggers, more urges,\u201d St Clair said.\nThe excessive downtime right now \u201cis not helping,\u201d said Jimmy Hamm, who owns a sober living home in New York City. Usually, he tries to fill his clients\u2019 schedules so they\u2019re busy and out of the house most of the time. Now, though, his Manhattan residence is in the middle of a Covid-19 global hotspot, and because of the virus, he\u2019s not even allowing the men he works with to go on walks without a staff member.\n\u201cWe keep telling them, \u2018listen, we\u2019re not punishing you. Listen, we\u2019re all suffering here. But be grateful that you all have each other,\u201d Hamm said.\nEven so, Hamm makes sure that his clients attend meetings \u2013 one at his sober home and two by video every day. With social distancing and self-isolation, support groups, meetings and mental health professionals have mostly moved online.\n\u201cWe want to acknowledge how hard this moment is, but we also want to encourage people to take advantage of the resources and solutions that are still available,\u201d said Jamie Tworkowski, founder of To Write Love on Her Arms, a not-for-profit that in part helps people struggling with addiction. \u201cWe don\u2019t want anyone to think, \u2018Oh, I just can\u2019t get any help right now because I\u2019m alone in my house.\u2019\u201d\nThe jury\u2019s still out on whether telehealth and online recovery resources on such a massive scale can effectively replace in-person contact for addiction treatment. At least two patients have told Aoun that they don\u2019t want to use his new online platform, and even if people do seek care or support, some of them may have additional screens in view, pulling their attention from the group they\u2019ve joined virtually, St Clair said.\nSome of Hamm\u2019s clients are tuning out during the virtual meetings, he said. Others seem to enjoy them. Regardless, Hamm didn\u2019t know what people would be doing without that lifeline.\n\u201cI mean, to be honest, I have a mixed bag about it, too,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s the only option we have.\u201d",

        "content": "Our Italy correspondent on how the crisis went from a foreign news story to a crisis that has cost thousands of Italian lives\nSometimes being a journalist means having to improvise. It was Sunday 23 February when Italy announced draconian measures to stop people leaving or entering 11 towns that had been put under quarantine - 10 in the Lombardy region and one in Veneto. I got up early that day to hike around Lake Albano in Castel Gandolfo, about 40 minutes by train from Rome. I had left home more prepared for the possibility of needing to work \u2013 bringing with me a notepad and pen \u2013 than I did for the hike.\nSure enough, 20 minutes into the walk the announcement came. I stopped, found a spot by the lake, and wrote the first 600 words that began the Guardian\u2019s coverage of Italy\u2019s coronavirus outbreak. Fortunately, I have a robust smartphone. Sitting by the lake, I had a feeling that life as we knew it had stopped. By the end of that day, three people had died of the virus and 152 were infected.\nWe knew Covid-19 had made it to Italy in late January, when two Chinese tourists in Rome were confirmed to have contracted it. \u201cNo more masks\u201d signs started to appear on the windows of chemists; my neighbour in Rome began disinfecting the banisters of the building\u2019s stairwell and door handles. \u201cYou never know,\u201d he said one morning, smoking a cigarette. I chalked most of this up to paranoia, not quite grasping that something that was happening so far away in China could reach Europe.\nSo when the outbreak suddenly emerged, it caught most of us off guard. As with any major breaking news story, a journalist\u2019s first instinct is to get to the scene quickly. In recent years, I\u2019ve covered an earthquake, an avalanche and the collapse of Genoa\u2019s Morandi bridge. All of those were tragedies that had a profound impact, but they were also ones in which the cause of the events and level of destruction was known and clearly visible. Covering the coronavirus outbreak, especially in the early stages, has been different in the sense that the threat is there, but cannot be seen or properly understood. Coverage needs more caution and planning.\nWith journalists unable to cross into the quarantined towns, the closest I got to the centre of the outbreak was Milan. That was on 25 February. I was fairly relaxed, worrying most about meeting my deadline. This time I had my computer with me, and filed the story from the foyer of a hotel close to the cathedral. A group of tourists were sitting nearby, coughing repeatedly. Did they have coronavirus? I became hypervigilant for potential symptoms.\nSince then, most of my reporting has been done by phone, as the country rapidly shut down.\nThe death toll and number of people infected kept going up. However, the high number of those recovering, including the two Chinese tourists, was reassuring. Three people I spoke to who had recovered said their symptoms were mild. My first insight into the virus\u2019s real destructiveness only came when I spoke to Costantino Pesatori, the mayor of Castiglione d\u2019Adda, one of the first Lombardy towns under quarantine, on 6 March. The town lost 18 citizens in less than two weeks, one of them a 55-year-old man who had no known underlying health issues. Three of the town\u2019s five doctors were in quarantine, the other two hospitalised with the virus. \u201cWe have many people with a fever who are at home and who are unable to be visited by a doctor,\u201d Pesatori said.\nStill, at that point, the voices \u2013 including some medics \u2013 saying \u201cthis is no worse than flu\u201d or \u201cmillions die of flu\u201d were louder than the voices of people such as Pesatori. The media came under attack. In one post shared on Facebook, coronavirus was described as \u201ca godsend\u201d for journalists who were using it to enjoy a moment in the limelight. Seeing friends who run small businesses in Italy worrying about their livelihoods, I felt guilty. Was I being irresponsible? But the more I wrote, the more I learned about the virus. I thought about family and friends who would be vulnerable to it, those either suffering or recovering from cancer, those with heart issues, diabetes, or high blood pressure. This wasn\u2019t an illness that affected only the elderly or frail. People were dying before their time, regardless of their age.\nAs we told stories about the victims, the overwhelmed hospitals and how Italy was struggling to bury its dead, the horror of the virus\u2019s impact started to hit home, especially abroad. When a reader emailed thanking us for our \u201cresponsible\u201d coverage, I cried. The reader had shared a story about Bergamo, the worst-affected province, with friends in the UK and said it had made an impact in terms of the message sinking in there.\nThe whole of Italy has been under lockdown for almost three weeks. Every day at 6pm the population solemnly tunes in for the \u201cwar bulletin\u201d, when the civil protection authority gives an update on the number of deaths and infected. There was hope on Monday when, for two days in a row, the numbers for both had decreased. All we have now is hope that Italy will soon turn a corner. And when it does, I look forward to finishing the hike around Lake Albano.",

        "content": "Coventry have taken legal advice and launched a petition that has been signed by thousands of businesses in the leisure industry after the Championship club\u2019s insurer refused to pay out when the season ended prematurely.\nIncome from the club\u2019s stadium, Butts Park Arena, stopped abruptly because of the coronavirus lockdown. That left them with a shortfall of \u00a3750,000 and their backer, Jon Sharp, stepped in to keep the club afloat and ensure this month\u2019s wages were paid.\nThe club fear their dire circumstances are commonplace outside the rugby union elite and that some clubs will go to the wall without help and a change in insurers\u2019 policies.\n\u201cWe would struggle to survive without him [Sharp],\u201d said Coventry\u2019s managing director, Nick Johnston. \u201cWe pay \u00a330,000 a year for insurance and were covered by notifiable diseases under the business disruption clause.\n\u201cWe were turned down because no one employed by us has tested positive for the virus and the excuse another Championship club was given was that Covid-19 was not listed among the diseases covered. It is new, so how could it be?\n\u201cWe are one of many businesses throughout the land in this position and we have taken legal counsel,\u201d Johnston added. \u201cThe government has been no help and from next month all our staff will be paid under the national job retention scheme.\u201d\n\u201cI appreciate that the priority is saving lives but make no mistake, we are talking about the future of rugby clubs.\u201d\nCoventry launched their petition at the beginning of last week and were contacted by several businesses in the leisure industry, who said they had experienced similar problems with insurers refusing to pay out. Some have claimed underwriters were trying to insert retrospective clauses concerning the virus.\nThe ban on social gatherings means no sport is being played in Britain and it may not resume for some months. Clubs and administrations have reacted to a drastic loss of income by cutting wages, prompting some Premiership Rugby players to consider refusing to accept what amounts to a breach of contract.\n\u201cI can see where they are coming from,\u201d said Johnston, \u201cbut at the same time how many Premiership clubs would be in business without the support of owners?\n\u201cThis is a very difficult time and no one knows when things will start to get back to normal. We are all trying to do the right thing and make sure we survive this, but there is only so much money to go around.\n\u201cThe government has been calling on banks to help business. The same needs to apply to the insurance industry.\u201d\nCoventry had four home league games remaining in the English second division, including one against the leaders, Newcastle, who were expected to attract a 5,000 sell-out crowd. Butts Park Arena plays host to a number of sports, including cricket in the summer, and is accessed by junior clubs, schools and universities while rooms are used for corporate functions.\n\u201cWe estimate we will lose \u00a3750,000,\u201d said Johnston. \u201cWe are covered by insurance and feel harshly treated. Some of our staff showed symptoms of the virus and were told to self-isolate after ringing 111. We are looking to establish whether they did have it to help with our claim because only Sars and Ebola were excluded on the policy.\n\u201cI struggle to sleep at night, worrying how to make sure everyone at the club still has a job when this all ends. I am determined to make sure they do.\u201d",

        "content": "Covid-19 has intensified the rivalry between the US and China \u2013 but it has also strengthened international co-operation. Will nations be more united or divided, more \u2013 or less \u2013 free?\nThe global impact of the coronavirus pandemic poses a fundamental question: is this one of those historic moments when the world changes permanently, when the balance of political and economic power shifts decisively, and when, for most people, in most countries, life is never quite the same again?\nPut more simply, is this the end of the world as we know it? And, equally, could the crisis mark a new beginning?\nGenuinely pivotal global moments, watersheds or turning points (pick your own terminology) are actually quite rare. Yet if the premise is correct \u2013 that there can be no return to the pre-Covid-19 era \u2013 then it poses many unsettling questions about the nature of the change, and whether it will be for better or worse.\nFor countless individuals and families, normal life has already been upended in previously unimaginable ways. But how will the pandemic influence the future behaviour of nation states, governments and leaders \u2013 and their often dysfunctional relationships? Will they work together more closely, or will this shared trauma further divide them?\nSome analysts see grounds for optimism, for example in beneficial environmental effects in northern Italy and China. Countries hitherto at odds, such as Iran and the UAE, are cooperating, at least temporarily. In the Philippines, the crisis prompted a ceasefire with Communist rebels. Global interdependence and the importance of collective, multilateral approaches have been vividly underscored.\nBut there is also a more pessimistic view, typified by Stephen Walt, professor of international relations at Harvard University. \u201cThe pandemic will strengthen the state and reinforce nationalism. Governments of all types will adopt emergency measures to manage the crisis, and many will be loath to relinquish these new powers when the crisis is over,\u201d he wrote in Foreign Policy magazine.\nWalt continued: \u201cCovid-19 will also accelerate the shift in power and influence from west to east. The response in Europe and America has been slow and haphazard by comparison [with China, South Korea and Singapore], further tarnishing the aura of the western \u2018brand\u2019\u2026 We will see a further retreat from hyper-globalisation, as citizens look to national governments to protect them and as states and firms seek to reduce future vulnerabilities.\n\u201cIn short, Covid-19 will create a world that is less open, less prosperous and less free.\u201d\nIs Walt right? The cop-out answer is only time will tell. Yet the outcome is not preordained. The responses of everybody, from presidents and prime ministers to ordinary citizens, to the myriad challenges and upheavals arising from the pandemic will help determine what happens next.\nIt\u2019s a chance to reset both global and personal landscapes. Notwithstanding present feelings of powerlessness, there are choices to be made about what kind of future awaits. After Covid-19, everything could be up for grabs.\nAfter early blunders, China\u2019s government is working hard to turn Covid-19, first detected in Wuhan in November, into a national success story. It claims draconian measures to suppress the disease have largely worked. Now, by offering assistance to Italy and other badly affected countries, China is reinforcing its credentials as a global leader. The virus has become a soft power tool to overtake its superpower rival, the US.\n\u201cA critical part of this narrative is Beijing\u2019s supposed success in battling the virus. A steady stream of propaganda articles, tweets and public messaging, in a wide variety of languages, touts China\u2019s achievements and highlights the effectiveness of its model of domestic governance,\u201d wrote commentators Kurt Campbell and Rush Doshi in Foreign Affairs magazine.\nIn contrast, Donald Trump is struggling to dispel a widespread perception of gross incompetence. \u201cThe US government\u2019s pandemic leadership has been its own special brand of catastrophe\u2026. [It] has placed its own citizens in unnecessary peril, while sidelining itself from acting as a global crisis leader,\u201d wrote Mira Rapp-Hooper of the US Council on Foreign Relations.\n\u201cThis domestic and international governance crisis could change the nature of the international order in several ways \u2026. If the US remains absent without leave, China may take the crisis as an opportunity to start setting new rules according to its own global governance vision,\u201d she continued.\nChina\u2019s challenge to US hegemony was already strengthening on many fronts before the Covid-19 crisis erupted. The pandemic may accelerate this shift. For US-allied democracies that value open governance, civil rights and free speech, this is a worrying prospect.\nThe trend towards centralised, authoritarian rule evident in countries such as India, Brazil and Turkey, and typified by China and Russia, has coincided with the rise of rightwing nationalist-populist governments and parties in Europe. Some are now following China\u2019s lead in attempting to weaponise the virus for political ends.\n\u201cThe pandemic unquestionably presents an era-defining challenge to public health and the global economy [but] its political consequences are less well-understood,\u201d the independent monitor, International Crisis Group, warned last week. \u201cUnscrupulous leaders may exploit the pandemic to advance their objectives in ways that exacerbate domestic or international crises \u2013 cracking down on dissent at home or escalating conflicts with rival states \u2013 on the assumption that they will get away with it while the world is otherwise occupied,\u201d the ICG said.\nOne example cited by the report was Vladimir Putin\u2019s recent attempt to indefinitely extend his presidency in Russia (although the virus has since forced him to postpone a vote that could have allowed him to stay in power until 2036). Another was a bid by Viktor Orb\u00e1n, Hungary\u2019s nationalist leader, to renew a state of emergency \u201cthat prescribes five-year prison sentences for those disseminating false information or obstructing the state\u2019s crisis response.\u201d\nGovernments such as Egypt\u2019s have followed China\u2019s example in expelling foreign journalists, restricting media access and curtailing public discussion. Like Boris Johnson and many European leaders, Trump has also assumed emergency powers. From Bolivia, India, Sri Lanka and Iraq to the US, UK and France, elections have been postponed, parliaments suspended, and lockdowns and curfews imposed.\nMost people may support such measures in the short term. But what if the crisis is protracted, with a \u201csecond wave\u201d running into next year? And what if the new controls are not relaxed or withdrawn after it ends? This is what Harvard\u2019s Stephen Walt meant about the danger of \u201cless free\u201d post-pandemic societies.\nUnprecedented government aid packages for businesses and workers, intended to mitigate the disease\u2019s economic and financial impact, have led some analysts to suggest \u201cthe state is back\u201d \u2013 and that the limits of the postwar neoliberal, free market model have finally been reached.\nWhat the crisis has shown, it is argued, is that when the challenge is truly existential, only the state can offer holistic and equitable solutions. A natural corollary is that the high-water mark of globalisation has arrived. These are radical paradigm shifts. Will they endure?\n\u201cThe pandemic could be the straw that breaks the camel\u2019s back of economic globalisation,\u201d wrote Robin Niblett, director of the Chatham House thinktank. The architecture of global economic governance established in the 20th century was at risk, he warned, raising the prospect that political leaders may \u201cretreat into overt geopolitical competition\u201d.\nFor Robert Kaplan of the Eurasia Group, \u201ccoronavirus is the historical marker between the first phase of globalisation and the second \u2026. Globalisation 2.0 is about separating the globe into great-power blocs with their own burgeoning militaries and separate supply chains, about the rise of autocracies, and about social and class divides that have engendered nativism and populism \u2026. In sum, it is a story about new and re-emerging global divisions.\u201d\nIf that\u2019s true, few will mourn the passing of the globalisation era. And support for Kaplan\u2019s theory may be found in increased post-pandemic protectionism if, as some predict, countries attempt to limit future exposure to global threats. The UN warned last week of worldwide food shortages caused by lack of workers, tougher immigration controls, sanctions and tariffs \u2013 and called for a new, more open approach.\nThe weakening of multilateral forums and institutions, evident before the crisis, is another sign of a shrinking world. Trying to revive their collective clout, the wealthy G20 countries belatedly pledged last week to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to fight the virus. But it remains largely unclear what that entails in practice, and who will take the lead.\nThe pandemic and its aftermath could be a game-changer for poorer countries with limited resources and means of recovery, and for refugees and people in conflict zones \u2013 but probably not in a good way.\nThe ICG report is blunt: \u201cThe global outbreak has the potential to wreak havoc in fragile states [and] trigger widespread unrest \u2026. If the disease spreads in densely packed urban centres, it may be virtually impossible to control.\u201d This is precisely the fear stalking South Africa\u2019s townships right now.\nThe report said the dramatic global economic slowdown would disrupt trade flows and create unemployment in commodity-exporting poorer countries. \u201cIts implications are especially serious for those caught in the midst of conflict if, as seems likely, the disease disrupts humanitarian aid flows, limits peace operations, and postpones diplomacy.\u201d\nWar-afflicted Syrians, Afghans, Somalis, South Sudanese and Yemenis could be especially badly affected. That\u2019s why the UN last week launched an appeal for $2bn in humanitarian aid. Its secretary-general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, wants trillions more in global financial stimulus to prevent \u201cmillions\u201d of deaths. \u201cCovid-19 is threatening the whole of humanity and the whole of humanity must fight back,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe pandemic is a powerful reminder of two things: the shared challenges of our global village, and the deep inequalities we must grapple with to fight them,\u201d said David Miliband, who heads the International Rescue Committee. \u201cCoronavirus is not just a problem for rich countries. We are only as strong as our weakest health system.\u201d\nWhether the international community heeds this and similar calls will be a key test.\nThe crisis has exposed an endemic lack of resilience, symbolised by chronically under-resourced healthcare systems in even better-off countries. The decision of many governments to call in the armed forces to help with logistics and manpower partly reflects fears that weakening social cohesion may lead to disorder on the streets.\n\u201cIf governments have to resort to using paramilitary or military forces to quell, for example, riots or attacks on property, societies could begin to disintegrate. Thus the main, perhaps even the sole objective of economic policy today [rather than supporting financial markets] should be to prevent social breakdown,\u201d wrote Branko Milanovi\u0107, a professor at the London School of Economics.\nYet, looked at differently, this kind of national mobilisation can be seen as a positive development rather than a threat to civil liberties \u2013 and as a more beneficial use of military power. In Britain as elsewhere, the call to arms has created new legions of NHS volunteers. This renewed sense of national sharing and identity is a much-needed antidote to the regressive nationalism of recent years.\n\u201cLooking ahead, governments will have to decide whether to support more cooperative approaches to handling the crisis, not only in global public health terms but also as a political and security challenge,\u201d the ICG said. \u201cAll leaders face pressure to focus on domestic priorities, and in particular to ignore conflict risks in weak states \u2026. But there will be a day after.\u201d\nWhile there is concern the pandemic could deepen divisions between countries and, for example, exacerbate anti-migrant sentiment, there is a fighting chance it will boost international cooperation, support for the UN, and a willingness to pursue dialogue rather than military and economic confrontation. The future need not be a globally debilitating US-China fight for supremacy.\nElisabeth Braw of the Royal United Services Institute warns of a moment of extreme geopolitical vulnerability. \u201cThe coronavirus is a perfect opportunity for the west\u2019s adversaries to watch how countries cope \u2013 or don\u2019t cope \u2013 with a major crisis,\u201d she wrote. But John Ikenberry, professor of international affairs at Princeton University, is less fearful, pointing to the US-led recovery after the 1930s Depression.\nIntensifying great power rivalry in a fractured, damaged, poorer world might indeed be the future that awaits, Ikenberry suggested. But it was equally possible that, \u201cover the longer term, the democracies will come out of their shells to find a new type of pragmatic and protective internationalism\u201d.\nIn other words, after the nightmare, a fresh start.\nThe Versailles peace conferenceThe 1919-20 conference that followed the first world war was a historic turning point. It marked the formal demise of the German, Russian and Austro-Hungarian empires, the advance of democratic, representative governance in Europe, and the start of what came to be known as the American or transatlantic century.\nThe Great DepressionThe Great Depression, the biggest worldwide economic calamity of the 20th century, began in the US in 1929 after the Wall Street crash. In the ensuing three years, global GDP fell by about 15% (compared with under 1% in the 2008-09 Great Recession). Things did not really pick up again until the second world war \u2013 a drastic remedy.\nThe battle of StalingradFought on the banks of the Volga in southern Russia in 1942-43, the close to seven-month battle, the biggest in history, proved to be a pivotal moment in the second world war in Europe. For the first time, Hitler\u2019s armies were halted and beaten, and the myth of German invincibility destroyed. About 2 million combatants died.\nThe fall of the Berlin WallThe peaceful fall in 1989 of the Berlin Wall, the actual and symbolic dividing line between the Soviet bloc and the west, in effect ended the 44-year-long cold war. The ensuing implosion of the Soviet Union triggered the collapse of Russian-backed regimes around the world, leading the US to proclaim itself the sole global superpower.\nThe 9/11 attacksThe attacks launched by al-Qaida on New York and Washington DC in September 2001 punctured American illusions of invulnerability and prompted George W Bush to declare a \u201cglobal war on terror\u201d. This led directly to the US invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, and the ensuing expansion of anti-western jihadism typified by Islamic State.",

It is not going to happen.\u201d\nIt is now expected that some other method will be found so that brief acceptance speeches can be made on the day of the announcement by the two winners.\nUnder the current plans the candidates to succeed outgoing leader Jeremy Corbyn and his former deputy Tom Watson will be informed of the result a few minutes before it is made public.\nThe deputy leadership is being contested by Angela Rayner, Rosena Allin-Khan, Richard Burgon, Ian Murray and Dawn Butler.\nThe original plan had to been to gather at least 1,000 party members and senior figures at a special conference in London to announce the new leader.\nStarmer is the bookies\u2019 favourite to win the contest for leader while Angela Rayner is regarded by many as frontrunner for the deputy post. On Friday Rayner announced she was \u201cself-isolating\u201d after suffering symptoms of coronavirus.\nShe said on Twitter: \u201cI am now in self isolation as I have the symptoms of #Coronavirus they started last night and have gradually got worse. I will be a bit quieter than usual but will still be keeping in touch with people as best as l can.\u201d\nIn an interview with the BBC\u2019s Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg on Friday, Corbyn said the country had been \u201cill-prepared\u201d for the coronavirus pandemic because of \u201c10 years of austerity, of underfunding the National Health Service and underfunding our benefit system\u201d.",

The 2013 production of Howard Brenton\u2019s Drawing the Line was directed by the late Howard Davies and, with a large cast, it tells of the chaotic partitioning of India in 1947 in a celebration of human endurance.\nRoxana Silbert, the current artistic director of the theatre in Swiss Cottage, north London, thanked the artists involved in allowing the project with the Guardian to go ahead so quickly. \u201cI hope these productions offer audiences entertainment, connection and nourishment in a time of uncertainty and isolation,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThese three plays all shine a light on turbulent points in international history which, along with acknowledging the worst of human behaviour, celebrate the ingenuity, humour, compassion and resilience of the best.\u201d\nI and You, Lauren Gunderson\u2019s witty portrayal of youthful friendship, a box office hit from 2018 starring Game of Thrones actor Maisie Williams, is streaming on Instagram\u2019s mobile video platform IGTV until 10pm on Sunday.",

Is that the right approach?\nIf there\u2019s been a fall in custom at the Nyhavn restaurant, it\u2019s hardly noticeable. Groups of drinkers huddle under heat lamps out on M\u00f6llev\u00e5ng Square, the centre of nightlife in the Swedish city of Malm\u00f6, seemingly oblivious to the virus spreading through Europe.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the Swedish trust in government,\u201d says Linus Bohman, 28. \u201cNo one told me you have to stay home right now,\u201d agrees his friend, Fredrik Gl\u00fcckman, a history student at Lund University. \u201cWe\u2019re not in quarantine. And as soon as we hear from our government that we have to stay in, like you do in Britain, then we will do it.\u201d\n\u201cBut not,\u201d Bohman adds, \u201cif Boris Johnson says it.\u201d\nWhile every other country in Europe has been ordered into ever more stringent coronavirus lockdown, Sweden has remained the exception. Schools for pupils up to 16 years, kindergartens, bars, restaurants, ski resorts, sports clubs, hairdressers: all remain open, weeks after everything closed down in next door Denmark and Norway.\nUniversities and upper secondary schools have been closed, and on Friday, the government tightened the ban on events to limit them to no more than 50 people. But if you develop symptoms, you can still go back to work or school just two days after you are \u2018symptom-free\u2019 . If a parent starts showing symptoms, they\u2019re allowed to continue to send their children to school.\nIt has only been in the past couple of days that the death toll has started to increase significantly, rising by a third in a single day on Thursday and Friday, with 92 people now dead and 209 in intensive care. As he announced the tighter restrictions on Friday, the prime minister, Stefan L\u00f6fven, warned that the coming weeks and months would be tough.\nBut he defended the decision not to implement the tighter restrictions seen in Denmark, France and the UK. \u201cWe all, as individuals, have to take responsibility. We can\u2019t legislate and ban everything,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is also a question of commonsense behaviour.\u201d\nAnders Tegnell, Sweden\u2019s state epidemiologist, believes it is counterproductive to bring in the tightest restrictions at too early a stage. \u201cAs long as the Swedish epidemic development stays at this level,\u201d he tells the Observer, \u201cI don\u2019t see any big reason to take measures that you can only keep up for a very limited amount of time.\u201d\nHis team at the Public Health Agency of Sweden is critical of the Imperial College paper that warned this month that 250,000 people in the UK would die if the government failed to introduce more draconian measures. A week later Johnson ordered the police to implement a partial lockdown to combat the virus, telling people they \u201cmust stay at home\u201d.\n\u201cWe have had a fair amount of people looking at it and they are sceptical,\u201d says Tegnell. \u201cThey think Imperial chose a number of variables that gave a prognosis that was quite pessimistic, and that you could just as easily have chosen other variables that gave you another outcome. It\u2019s not a peer-reviewed paper. It might be right, but it might also be terribly wrong. In Sweden, we are a bit surprised that it\u2019s had such an impact.\u201d\nThe best explanation for why Sweden is such an outlier centres on the unusual level of independence given to government agencies such as Tegnell\u2019s, and the reluctance of politicians to override them.\n\u201cI feel that the Swedish government is handling this very reasonably,\u201d argues Erika Lindquist, who is drinking with her brother and Danish husband at another table at the Nyhavn. \u201cThey\u2019re listening to the health department; they\u2019re listening to the experts they have on hand.\u201d\nThere is criticism, however. More than 2,000 Swedish university researchers published a joint letter on Wednesday questioning the Public Health Agency\u2019s position, while the previous week saw leading epidemiologists attack the agency in emails leaked to Swedish television.\n\u201cHow many lives are they willing to sacrifice so as not to lockdown and risk greater effects on the economy?\u201d asked one, Joacim Rockl\u00f6v, a professor of epidemiology at Ume\u00e5 University.\nTegnell argues that because in Sweden there are almost no stay-at-home parents, closing schools would have knocked out at least a quarter of doctors and nurses, crippling the health service. By pushing children out into society, it might even have increased the threat to the elderly, particularly if they were called upon to babysit.\nHe points out that Sweden has almost no households where the over-70s live with younger adults and children.\nTegnell even questions whether stopping the progress of the virus is desirable. \u201cWe are just trying to slow it, because this disease will never go away. If you manage, like South Korea, to get rid of it, even they say that they count on it coming back. Stopping it might even be negative, because you would have a pent-up possible spread of the disease, and then once you open the gates, there is a possibility that there would be an even worse outcome.\u201d\nWhile Tegnell understands that he will be blamed if Sweden ends up in a similar situation to that of Italy, he refuses to be panicked. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be too surprised if it ended up about the same way for all of us, irrespective of what we\u2019re doing,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not so sure that what we\u2019re doing is affecting the spread very much. But we will see.\u201d\n This article was amended on 30 March and 2 April 2020. An earlier version misnamed Linus Bohman, who is quoted in the piece, as Elias Billman. On 2 April it was amended to clarify: that the government advice is to return to work two days after you are \u2018symptom-free\u2019 rather than \u201cfeel better\u201d and that schools for pupils up to 16 remain open but upper secondary schools have closed.",

        "content": "A crowd of 50,617 were present at Football Park to witness a masterclass by the Roosters \nThere are few years as significant in the timeline of Australian football as 1987. It was the year the VFL welcomed teams from Western Australia and Queensland, signposting the first iteration of the AFL and the end to a state model that had pervaded for more than a century. It was the year Australia\u2019s indigenous sport grew up and adopted a national approach.\nBut it wasn\u2019t there just yet. South Australia, Victoria\u2019s long-time archrival, was having none of it. The SANFL was robust, well-patronised and financially secure. Despite repeated overtures from the VFL to become part of the new order, South Australia would go it alone.\nIn hindsight it was a nearsighted view. But if the VFL was the dog\u2019s bollocks back then, the SANFL was the cat\u2019s pyjamas. In 1987 a classic South Australian trilogy would enact its final stanza. North Adelaide and Glenelg had contested the 1985 and 1986 grand finals, both won by the Bays, and were to meet again in the 1987 decider at Football Park, still the most ingeniously named stadium in world sport.\nThe match itself was a concoction of brutality and artistic expression inconceivable today. Take a look at the melee early in the first quarter and it\u2019s hard to tell where the crew-cuts stopped and the mullets began. \u201cWayne Stringer\u2019s been reported, I think, but there could have been at least 10,\u201d the commentator Ian Day cried. The game was barely minutes old.\nGlenelg were withering in the heat. As well as winning the fight, North were landing punches on the scoreboard. Darren Jarman, the most sublimely talented footballer this correspondent has seen, stamped his mark with two first-quarter goals from his non-preferred left boot, including one on the run, hard on the boundary 45 metres out, that he executed with a conventional drop punt. Trailing by 31 points, Glenelg were as good as broken with three quarters still to play.\nThe match became a procession, a celebration of all things red and white, with the Roosters winning by 82 points. Michael Nunan, North Adelaide\u2019s coach, spoke of monkeys being removed from backs. The new premiers had winners everywhere but it was Michael Parsons, the former basketballer, whose six-goal haul won him the Jack Oatey medal for best afield. Parsons was also a menacing physical presence; one or two of his tackles were even legal.\nA crowd of 50,617 at Football Park witnessed a masterclass. Not present was yours truly. As a North Adelaide-mad family we had attended the 1985 and 1986 grannies, but, scarred by those heavy defeats, the bill payers of the household thought it best to stay away in 87. Strangely, I don\u2019t recall it irking me. I do remember, however, watching the game on TV with my dad, scarf and beanie on, flag in hand, cheering on the mighty Roosters. I was only 12 yet I\u2019d seen enough to know I was, albeit remotely, in the company of greatness.\nThose were heady days. But change was afoot. The talent drain from South Australia was gathering pace. Faced with the threat of Port Adelaide stealing its thunder, the SANFL softened and in 1991 the Crows joined the AFL. By then, State of Origin footy had run its race, and state leagues had become what they are today: strong, but subservient to the bigger dog. Things would never be the same again.\nBut in 1987, the SANFL was still a force. In 1987 it was blessed with a team of rare quality. North scooped the pool that year, with Andrew Jarman\u2019s Magarey medal and John Roberts\u2019 Ken Farmer medal for most goals in the season (111) completing the holy trinity. The Roosters didn\u2019t just win the grand final on that sunny Saturday in October; they romped it, annihilating a very good team in an exhibition for the ages.\n\u201cThis surely was the greatest performance in the history of the North Adelaide football club,\u201d former Glenelg and Essendon defender Paul Weston said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s stretching the point too far to say that, in the mood North players were in on Saturday, any team in Australia would have struggled to beat them.\u201d\nI may be biased, but I\u2019m inclined to agree.",

        "content": "Tottenham and Manchester City are among the clubs who would probably make very different decisions if they could reset the Premier League as if it were Football Manager\nThe season must be completed. The season must be abandoned now. As the arguments gabble on, only occasionally acknowledging their own hypothetical nature given how little we know about how the virus will proceed, how long the lockdown may last and whether there may be a second wave of infections when it is lifted, it\u2019s tempting t o dip into another hypothetical. What if this were like a game of Football Manager? What if we could quit without saving and go back and start again last summer? What would Premier League clubs, given their time over, do differently?\nLet\u2019s start with the obvious one: Tottenham\u2019s decision to sack Mauricio Pochettino and replace him with Jos\u00e9 Mourinho. Once a path has been embarked on, there is perhaps some logic in pursuing it to its conclusion, but would Daniel Levy really take that road again? Tottenham are without a win in their past six games. They\u2019ve gone out of the FA Cup and Champions League. They\u2019re seven points adrift of fourth. They\u2019ve kept three clean sheets in 26 games under Mourinho. For Spurs, this season has been a shambles.\nInjuries haven\u2019t helped, while Mourinho loyalists point to a creaking and jaded squad. But if the squad is an excuse for Mourinho, why was it not for Pochettino? It\u2019s not as though he wasn\u2019t aware of its failings, not as though he hadn\u2019t been campaigning for two years for greater transfer spending.\nLevy, given the choice between replacing the manager or the bulk of the squad, went for the manager, but it looks as if he will end up having to replace the bulk of the squad as well. And when it comes down to it, which would you rather have: a thrusting manager with a point to prove and a recent history of team-building on a budget or a weary former great who has come increasingly to deal in big transfers and whose ideas have begun to look outmoded?\nIn terms of other managerial comings and goings, Watford may think they could have sacked Javi Gracia in the summer rather than waiting until September and they certainly wouldn\u2019t bother again with the 12 games under Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores. Everton, Arsenal and West Ham, perhaps, will think that they could have acted more swiftly to arrest seasons that were drifting.\nIn terms of the top of the table, Liverpool would presumably change very little, although they might perhaps look at what happened around the winter break and wonder if something in their schedule led to the slight loss of rhythm in February and early March. Given how the Atl\u00e9tico game turned out, they might also look at upgrading their reserve goalkeeper.\nFor Manchester City, though, there is one clear problem that they would surely take steps to address: the lack of cover at centre-back. The departure of Vincent Kompany inevitably risked leaving a vacuum of leadership, but there was no need for there also to be a vacuum of defensive nous. With Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi always a slightly rash and clumsy figure, the least obviously Guardiolista player in the squad, and John Stones\u2019s form uncertain, City were left extremely dependent on Aymeric Laporte. That he has started seven league games this season is the major reason the gap to Liverpool is so vast, not only because of his absence but because Fernandinho has been lost to the midfield as he has been forced to drop back as an emergency central defender.\nManchester United\u2019s case is intriguing. Given their improvement after the arrival of Bruno Fernandes \u2013 they have won six and drawn three games since signing him at the end of January \u2013 they would presumably try to land him in the summer. Harry Maguire, assuming United still deemed him worth the \u00a380m fee, would probably have been signed earlier in the summer to give him more time to adjust to his new teammates; the attempt to drive down the fee by drawing out negotiations simply did not work.\nGiven that Paul Pogba has started five league games this season and none since September, offloading him last summer presumably would be a priority; surely nobody now, even at United, thinks a positive future still awaits him at the club? And there are those, too, who would argue that Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r should have been replaced when Pochettino became available, although recent form has perhaps begun to soften the concerns about the Norwegian\u2019s long-term suitability for the job.\nWhat about signings that clubs would now avoid? Would City spend \u00a358.5m on Jo\u00e3o Cancelo, who has started eight league games? Newcastle, surely, would not spend \u00a340m on Joelinton, a forward wholly unsuited to the isolated frontman role he has been asked to fulfil. Spurs might still splash out \u00a354m on Tanguy Ndombele, but not if they still planned to bring in Mourinho. Aston Villa, perhaps, would rethink their entire transfer strategy: they spent \u00a3140m to no great effect. While the injury to Wesley was unfortunate, only Tyrone Mings has been a clear success. West Ham would probably reconsider their transfer policy, but it\u2019s hard to think of the last season when that wouldn\u2019t have been the case.\nLeicester and Chelsea presumably wouldn\u2019t change too much, although Frank Lampard might start using Olivier Giroud earlier given the opportunity. But perhaps the most interesting case of a club with little to fix is Norwich. It is easy to say that they should have spent more, that a splurge on a couple of high-class players might make the difference for them.\nBut given the financial constraints under which they operate, it\u2019s not clear how much more they could have done. Daniel Farke is a consistently engaging coach whose young team play attractive, bright football. It wouldn\u2019t have taken much to have gone differently for them not to be adrift at the bottom.\nThat, perhaps, is the key: the league table doesn\u2019t lie, but it cannot be considered without context. And that\u2019s where asking, given context, what might reasonably have been improved feels useful. No audit can look only at results.",

Until Thursday, the place had buzzed with activity, day and night. Many members of staff were exhausted, working 18-hour days, or more, at what had for weeks been the national nerve centre for coordinating responses to the pandemic. Some were sleeping in the building to avoid the risks of public transport and to save time.\nSenior ministers including Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, and Matt Hancock, the health secretary, were regularly in and out of formal meetings and more impromptu discussions with the PM, as were Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser to the government, and Professor Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer. Until the middle of last week, meetings of Cobra, the emergency committee, were still taking place, mainly person to person, rather than remotely. But when Johnson tested positive, having developed a cough and temperature during Thursday afternoon \u2013 and it was later announced that Hancock had contracted the virus, too \u2013 such gatherings, and the free movement of people inside Downing Street, were halted.\nAt lunchtime on Friday, Johnson\u2019s chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, appeared to have recognised the urgency of the situation and was seen running out of the building by a back exit with a large rucksack on his back. A decision was taken to close and lock the door between Nos 10 and 11. Johnson\u2019s solitary confinement meant food, drink and papers had to be left outside his door. Hancock stayed at home. Then, on Saturday, the secretary of state for Scotland, Alister Jack, announced that he was self-isolating after developing coronavirus symptoms. He had yet to be tested.\nFor Downing Street staff who were still at work keeping the machine going, new routes had to be taken. \u201cNow, we have to go via an underground passage if we want to get to another part of the building,\u201d said an insider. After days of telling the public where they could and could not go, staff at the heart of government were having to fall into line, too.\nThe news that Johnson and Hancock had contracted Covid-19 \u2013 and, later on Friday, that Whitty had developed symptoms \u2013 raised two urgent new questions to add to the long list already facing ministers. Most immediately: how was it that three of the four-strong team of politicians and medical experts leading the national appeals to people to stay at home and observe social distancing had allowed themselves to fall victim to the virus? And how could government at this time of national emergency continue to function if Covid-19 took many more victims in high places in Westminster, Whitehall and Downing Street?\nJohnson had certainly not practised what he had preached. As well as attending Cobra meetings in person, with key ministers and the country\u2019s leading medical experts, he had been pictured in the Commons on Wednesday, after prime minister\u2019s questions, in a close cluster around the Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle. On Friday, Hoyle felt he had to issue a statement saying he was fit and well, given Johnson that had just tested positive. On Wednesday too, the prime minister posed for pictures standing alongside the Labour MP Rupa Huq and her son. The London MP writes an article for Sunday\u2019s Observer on the failure of parliament to adapt to safer working practices during the outbreak.\nFellow Labour MP Lucy Powell said the whole of government should have decided to operate remotely far earlier: \u201cIt is extraordinary that we did not take measures to close parliament earlier than we did. Westminster and Whitehall have not set a good example to the country, which may be why people have been slow to act on the advice. There are high numbers of MPs who have already had the virus or have got it now. Nadine Dorries had it two weeks ago. So parliament could, and should, have moved to working via [video conferencing platform] Zoom instead of gathering in an epicentre and then disbursing round the country.\u201d\nBy and large, the public is still supportive of the government\u2019s actions and responses, aware of the complexity and enormity of the crisis, and the unprecedented nature of the challenge. An Opinium survey for the Observer taken in the latter half of last week, but before news of Johnson\u2019s illness broke, shows 65% of voters approve of the handling of the coronavirus outbreak. But 56% think government did not move fast enough on a number of fronts, including testing and social distancing. As the number of cases of and deaths from coronavirus grows, questions about the adequacy and speed of the response will only grow. Jonathan Ashworth, Labour\u2019s health spokesperson, who has offered support to the government where possible, said the most criticisms came from within the medical establishment so could not be dismissed as mere political point scoring.\n\u201cA pandemic demands resolve and rapid action from governments. In recent weeks, there have been more and more voices in the wider medical community questioning whether the UK was moving at the speed necessary. NHS staff have continued to warn of delays in accessing protective equipment, we still have not got the ventilators that will be vital, we are not testing at the levels the World Health Organization recommends and many believe social-distancing measures should have been implemented earlier.\u201d\nInevitably at such a time, there have been tensions at the heart of government, notably between Hancock and Gove, over the handling of the crisis and signs of a lack of central control. Whitehall insiders say there is concern that No 10 has not been clear to other departments what their roles should be. There is also dismay that Downing Street has leaked out initiatives, such as plans for a total lockdown of London, which it has not then gone on to announce, causing huge confusion and alarm. \u201cAt times, it has seemed that one arm of government does not know what the other arm is doing,\u201d said one source.\nLast week, some in medical circles were questioning why ministers had not opted to take part in an EU bulk-buying scheme for ventilators, which it was eligible for as the UK is still in its Brexit transition phase. At one stage, Downing Street said it had missed a vital email about a deadline for joining the system. The Observer also understands that offers from foreign companies, including at least one from China, to provide badly needed medical equipment to the UK were held up because of bureaucracy and the UK\u2019s insistence that they would be subject to high customs duties. Chinese companies have found that trying to donate ventilators to the UK has proved far more difficult than it has been to other European countries because of paperwork and arguments over whether they meet NHS standards.\nThe acting co-leader of the Liberal Democrats Ed Davey said confusion over the orders of ventilators was inexcusable: \u201cWho in their right mind wouldn\u2019t want to act with other countries to source ventilators?\u201d Referring to the UK\u2019s failure to join the EU scheme, he added: \u201cWhat it shows is, when it comes to the European issue, the government is so unclear about how they are going to handle the relationship with Europe that they can\u2019t get their act together. It\u2019s quite irresponsible.\u201d\nWriting in the Observer , the Tory MP Dr Dan Poulter, who works part time in the NHS as a psychiatrist and is treating many patients with Covid-19, says testing of NHS staff is urgently needed and could be a \u201cgame changer\u201d. Based on his experience of the NHS frontline, he writes: \u201cNHS staff sickness levels are already high, and they are only going to increase as the Covid-19 outbreak intensifies. Many of us are also worried that we may be infected yet asymptomatic [showing no symptoms] and therefore could be a potential risk to our patients, colleagues and families. That is the last thing that we would want, but we simply do not know. Widespread NHS staff testing would be a game changer and would help NHS clinicians to both protect our patients and return to the frontline faster.\u201d\nDavid Hunter, a professor of epidemiology and medicine at Oxford University, said a national effort was needed to ensure testing takes place effectively. He explained: \u201cWe urgently need someone in charge whose only job it is to solve the supply chain, equipment, personnel and IT issues that are inhibiting the maximal testing scale-up and who reports to the public on progress daily until there is adequate capacity.\u201d\nWhile Johnson and Hancock insist they can continue to handle the crisis despite having become its victims, there are many who are raising questions about their ability to do so alone. Davey believes opposition parties need to come together to hold the government constructively to account in a newly formed committee along the lines adopted in New Zealand. Others are suggesting a new national government, an idea supported by 44% of voters, according to Opinium.\nPoulter says, from his own personal experience, that the NHS is already at \u201cmaximum stretch\u201d. Equally worrying is that Boris Johnson\u2019s government is, too \u2013 and yet, as he says in a letter to the nation today, the worst is yet to come.",

The government says there has been a surge in the number of Google searches looking for support services for domestic violence during the pandemic.\nThe bulk billing incentive for GPs providing telehealth consultations during the crisis will be doubled. The government will also provide an incentive payment to ensure practices stay open to provide face-to-face services when necessary. The funding boost will be in place until the end of September.\nMental health programs will be boosted by $74m, including $10m for a dedicated coronavirus wellbeing support line, delivered by Beyond Blue, to help people experiencing concern due to a coronavirus diagnosis, or experiencing stress or anxiety due to employment changes, business closure, financial difficulties, family pressures or other challenges.\nAn additional $14m will go to mental health support providers, including $5m for Lifeline and $2m for Kids Helpline. The government says mental health support services have experienced an unprecedented surge in call volumes during the pandemic.\nThe government is promising dedicated support services for health workers, and an additional $10m for the community visitors scheme to ensure elderly people in aged care aren\u2019t isolated by coronavirus-related restrictions on visitors. The government says the funding will mean extra staff can be engaged to train volunteer visitors to connect with elderly people online and the the phone.\nA community support package worth $200m will scale up services through the national debt helpline and increase funding to food relief organisations to source additional food and transport for emergency relief service providers.\nIn a statement, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said the funding would flow immediately.\n\u201cAs we battle coronavirus on both the health and economic fronts with significant support packages in place and more to come, I am very aware many Australians are understandably anxious, stressed and fearful about the impacts of coronavirus and what it brings,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe are focused on saving lives and saving livelihoods and this new support package will provide much needed care and help to so many Australians facing hardship at no fault of their own.\u201d\nAs well as the support package outlined on Sunday, the government is working up a third round of safety net measures on the assumption that swathes of the economy will move into a period of suspended animation as lockdowns take effect.\nConceptually, the government wants to ensure that businesses don\u2019t emerge from the pandemic with substantial liabilities on their books that would force them to either declare bankruptcy or sack substantial numbers of workers.\nRestrictions already in place to slow the spread of coronavirus have caused a major economic shock and triggered thousands of local job losses over the past week, and the government has unveiled two stimulus packages over the past three weeks worth $189bn.\nJob shedding is gathering pace. Myer announced late on Friday night it would shut its stores, and on Saturday the clothing stores Country Road and Cotton On, and the stationery store kikki.K followed suit. Total job losses across Australia now exceed 75,000.\nMorrison has acknowledged that further lockdowns will be required in New South Wales and Victoria to try to prevent an acceleration of community transmissions of the virus. NSW, Victoria and the ACT have signalled more restrictions are on the way.\nOn Friday the prime minister hinted further restrictions to enforce social distancing will likely be accompanied by a third round of economic support from Canberra.\nOn Friday, the government said Australian citizens and residents returning from overseas would be forced to quarantine in hotels in a bid to stop returning passengers breaching existing self-isolation requirements. Those arrangements came into effect midnight Saturday.",

No 10 said on Friday that it had narrowed the options down to seven.\nThe shortlist includes companies proposing to design and build machines from scratch, such as the partnership between Dyson and Cambridge-based The Technology Partnership.\nDefence company Babcock is also building its own machine, working with an unnamed firm specialising in medical equipment.\nOn Friday evening, a consortium of seven Formula One teams including Aston Martin, Mercedes-AMG and Renault said they were working on multiple ventilator projects, under the banner Project Pitlane.\nCompanies that already make ventilators are also scaling up production. Breas UK, the British arm of a Swedish company, has tripled capacity and moved to a seven-day working week to increase production at its Stratford-upon-Avon site.\nCrawley-based Inspiration Healthcare signed a \u00a34m contract with the government to import devices from Israel and the US, although the order is understood to be for fewer than 500, likely to help bridge any gaps until new machines become available.\nVentilator Challenge UK has made the fastest progress and expects to begin production this week.\nThe arrival of the first batch could ease pressure on Boris Johnson, who tested positive for Covid-19 last week, after it emerged that the government missed an opportunity to take part in four EU ventilator procurement schemes, because of a \u201ccommunications problem\u201d.",

Nine-year-old Benni (Helena Zengel) is a hostage to her own erratic impulses and scalding rage. Early childhood trauma has left unhealed wounds which, as she pinballs between care homes and psychiatric facilities, only seem to get deeper. Her hunger for love sharpens with each rejection; rejections that she herself pre-emptively engineers, severing emotional ties with a brandished bread knife or a chair hurled at a head. But a connection with no-nonsense youth worker Micha (Albrecht Schuch) seems to offer a sliver of hope.\nWriter and director Nora Fingscheidt uses every tool at her disposal to connect us with the short circuiting electrical fire of Benni\u2019s mind. It\u2019s as vivid in its portrayal of detonating anger issues as Uncut Gems was in getting into the skin of a thrill-seeking risk addict. The camerawork has a hyperactive mania that, together with the glitchy editing and a rushing, skittering score, captures the headlong dash of Benni\u2019s interaction with the world. But most essential is the central performance: Zengel\u2019s oscillating wild joys and storming furies are painful to watch. A moment when she howls for her mother (always tantalisingly out of reach) brought me to tears.\n Available to stream via Curzon Home Cinema and Mubi",

Among the countries to report new cases are South Korea (105) and and Thailand (143). China said it had 45 new cases on Saturday with all but one imported. France has passed 2,000 deaths. Spain, Northern Ireland and Timor-Leste are among countries to introduce new waves of restrictions.\nDonald Trump flagged an enforced regional quarantine of the state of New York and parts of Connecticut and New Jersey, saying \u201csome people would like to see New York quarantined because it\u2019s a hotspot\u201d. But he backed off after the New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, said sealing off the states would amount to \u201ca federal declaration of war\u201d. The US CDC then issued an urgent warning, effective immediately, against all non-essential domestic travel in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut for 14 days. The order was due to \u201cextensive community transmission\u201d in the areas. Employees of trucking, food supply, financial services and some other industries were exempt from the measure, and governors of the three states had full discretion over how to carry out the advisory. More than 120,000 people have become infected with Covid-19 in the US.\nThe first of up to 10 flights to be sent to China to pick up medical equipment for Ireland was on its way back on Sunday morning. More than \u20ac225m had been spent on personal protective equipment for Irish health workers, said the minister for health, Simon Harris. Usually around \u20ac15m is spent in a year.\nNew Zealand authorities reported the first death from Covid-19 on Sunday. The West Coast woman was in her 70s, and was initially diagnosed with influenza. Because of this hospital staff were only wearing PPE suitable for a case of influenza, not Covid-19, and 21 people were now in self-isolation. Authorities said none of the staff were showing symptoms and staffing at the hospital wouldn\u2019t be affected because of the cancellation of all elective procedures.\nSophie Gregoire Trudeau, wife of the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said she had recovered from Covid-19. Her husband and their three children have been in isolation without symptoms. \u201cWhen we get through this, we will be stronger because we will have had each other\u2019s backs,\u201d she said on social media.\nThousands of African, Haitian and Asian migrants bound for the United States have amassed in immigration shelters in Panama and Costa Rica as plans to relocate them to less crowded areas to lower the risk of spreading the coronavirus have faltered. Costa Rica\u2019s government has said it began transferring about 2,600 migrants headed for the United States from its southern border with Panama to its frontier with Nicaragua, citing concerns that large crowds could further spread the virus. However, the head of Costa Rica\u2019s immigration office, Raquel Vargas, told Reuters on Saturday that the transfer was suspended until further notice.\nThe Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, said Australia\u2019s daily rate of increase in confirmed cases had dropped from between 25-30% down to 13-15%, which showed the government\u2019s containment measures were working. However the Australian government would not release modelling to support this. Government and health authorities expressed anger at reports of 33 medical professionals who returned to Australia on Saturday night but did not go into the mandatory hotel quarantine announced by the government on Friday. The state health minister said it was \u201cbitterly disappointing \u2026 They are the people you would expect to know better than anyone else.\u201d Morrison told media that out of the country\u2019s 3,809 confirmed cases there were 2,562 imported from overseas. Two new fatalities were reported on Sunday, bringing the country\u2019s death toll from the outbreak to 16.\nThe Zandam cruise ship, with hundreds of passengers on board including at least 130 with flu-like symptoms, has been granted passage through the Panama Canal. Four people on the ship have died and others with symptoms have been diagnosed with Covid-19.\nA letter from the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, who is in isolation with Covid-19, will be sent to every household in Britain, warning that the epidemic will get worse before it gets better.",

She told me I had saved her life because her kids were driving her up the wall.\nThursday\nRishi Sunak offers to cover 80% of the average monthly earnings for the self-employed. Then we get a real fright when Next announces that it will not be taking any more orders. If other suppliers close too, our jobs could be at risk. We are paid per parcel. If you are doing 100 parcels a day, that\u2019s, say, \u00a3100 a day \u2013 but if a major client shuts down then you might only deliver 50.\nFriday\nToday I only had 45 parcels. Normally it\u2019s 70 to 80 \u2013 it has almost halved. There are couriers who will be on the breadline if they lose work.\nMonday\nFor the last few weeks I\u2019ve been coming into contact with hundreds of people each day at work. It makes me feel apprehensive and worries my wife. We\u2019ve had lots of people abusing staff and panic-buying. I spend the evening hoping everything will get a bit calmer during the lockdown.\nTuesday\nWhen I arrive at work at 5.40am there is already a queue of between 100 and 200 people outside. I spend most of the day restocking the shelves. People are still pushing past me or leaning across me to get something on the shelf, rather than waiting for me to move out of their way.\nWednesday\nI am on the till. A couple of people exceed the amount they are allowed to buy, and when I tell them, they swear at me. Abuse towards shop workers is quite prevalent in general, and it\u2019s getting worse due to the outbreak.\nThursday\nThere are fewer gaps on the shelves, and the shop is quieter. It is the first day I feel the message about staying in is slowly starting to get through. But then I see couples still bringing their kids into the shop. Surely one of them could stay at home with their children while the other goes shopping.\nFriday\nAn elderly gentleman is told he needs to stand behind the line while packing his shopping. He makes comments like, \u201cOh, who makes these stupid bloody rules?\u201d But then a man comes up and says he wants to thank us all for what we are doing. When you get one customer like that, you can forget about five of the abusers.\nMonday\nThis disease targets everyone, of all ages. I\u2019ve seen patients in their 30s really sick with the heart complications you get with Covid-19, and fit and well patients in their 40s and 50s who are very sick. People are kidding themselves if they think they\u2019re safe. So it was weird, before the lockdown, seeing the streets completely packed.\nTuesday\nStill seeing people on my way to work ignoring the lockdown blew my mind. The big challenge with managing Covid-19 patients is that it\u2019s not obvious when they\u2019re deteriorating. That\u2019s heartbreaking. Patients seem blissfully unaware they may be about to die.\nWednesday\nI have the day off, which I spend reading guidance on the disease and listening to a podcast for non-intensive-care doctors about how to, for example, manage a ventilator. I want to be good at my job in the months ahead and aware of every possible challenge I am likely to encounter.\nThursday\nBack at work. I have asthma, and my personal protective equipment is just a plastic gown, a pair of gloves and a surgical mask. It\u2019s pretty alarming going in to see a patient who\u2019s coughing their lungs out, and all you\u2019ve got is a piece of paper over your mouth. But Public Health England says that\u2019s all I need. I have got to trust that recommendation, and I do.\nFriday\nI arrive at work for a night shift. More than 10 people with Covid-19 symptoms are waiting for beds. They all have an oxygen requirement. It gets busy but we remain in control throughout. I have confidence in our ability to manage this. My advice to people is: cherish the moments you have with your family. Because if you die from this, you die alone.",

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.\u00a0Learn more.\nThe closure of schools across the UK has left many parents and carers in the sudden, unexpected position of being home-school teachers. Schools are providing support where they can, but there are also still plenty of smartphone and tablet apps that can be used as part of learning.\nThe Guardian\u2019s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.\u00a0Learn more.\nIt may be tricky to get some children to see these devices as good for more than TikTok, Fortnite and (adult) YouTube, but the positive side is that the best learning apps are interesting enough to \u2013 perhaps with an initial nudge \u2013 engage children. Here are 20 apps that may get parents off to a good start. The \u201cyounger children\u201d apps are most suitable for preschool and early primary kids, while the \u201colder children\u201d apps are more for later primary and early secondary age.\n(Android/Apple/Amazon \u2013 free) \n  The entire range of the BBC\u2019s CBeebies apps will be getting heavy usage in the coming weeks, clearly. They\u2019re all good, but this is the one focused on learning games, from phonics and geography to feelings and self-care, all based on the parent channel\u2019s shows and characters.\n(Android/Apple/Amazon \u2013 free) \n  Khan Academy is a free collection of education courses for all ages, but it has an app specifically for two to seven-year-old children that focuses on maths, reading and social and emotional skills. It has a large and growing archive of learning videos, digital books and simple but engaging exercises.\n(Android/Apple/Amazon \u2013 subscription)\n  For very young children who\u2019ll be missing out on some of the formative teaching at preschool this year, this beautifully crafted app could be a great help. From maths and phonics to music and early coding, its colourful exercises never feel dry or dull. It costs \u00a35.49 a month.\n(Android/Apple/Amazon \u2013 subscription)\n  British company Hopster describes its app as \u201ceducational kids\u2019 TV\u201d. What that means is a collection of familiar cartoons and shows including the likes of Sesame Street, Bob the Builder, Thomas the Tank Engine, Fireman Sam and Pingu, accompanied by fun learning games on topics such as maths and phonics. It will even remind kids not to binge on too many episodes in a row. It costs \u00a34.99 a month.\n(Android/Apple/Amazon \u2013 free)\n  This usually costs \u00a34.99, but has been made free owing to the school disruption. No matter how you feel after a couple of days of home-schooling, the titular monster isn\u2019t your child. Instead, this gets children to create a monster and then teach it to read \u2013 a great way of learning themselves.\n(Android/Apple/Amazon \u2013 subscription) \n  This is one of a growing number of subscription-based children\u2019s apps \u2013 seen as a more trustworthy model than in-app purchases and/or ads. Aimed at preschool children, it\u2019s another collection of learning games, but also has videos, picture-making and songs from the TV show. It costs \u00a34.99 a month.\n(Android/Apple \u2013 free)\n  After a rocky start when some non-child-friendly videos made it through the filters, YouTube has worked hard to make its official children\u2019s app something parents can trust. It includes a dedicated learning category collecting great videos about science, nature, space and other topics.\n(Apple \u2013 \u00a33.99)\n  It\u2019s been out for a few years, but this is still one of the best maths apps for children that feels genuinely educational. It\u2019s built around a range of maths exercises and progress tests. Separate versions cover children up to the age of 11, and there\u2019s a spelling series, too.\n(Android/Apple \u2013 \u00a33.99) \n  \u201cBig A, little a. What begins with A?\u201d Well, augmented reality does, for a start. Dr Seuss\u2019s inimitable alphabet book has been turned into an AR app, with animated characters appearing in the room around your child. The learning aspects include tracing the letters to learn their shapes for (non-AR) writing.\n(Android/Apple/Amazon \u2013 free) \n  Scratch is the programming environment that a lot of children will be familiar with already from school. ScratchJr is an app version designed for five to seven-year-olds, although older children can have fun with it, too. It uses coding blocks to create programs for games, animation, music and other creative tasks.\n(Android/Apple \u2013 free + in-app purchases) \n  This recently released maths game challenges children in quickfire sums, increasing in difficulty if they keep answering correctly. They write the numbers on the touchscreen with their finger rather than tapping buttons. It\u2019s free to try, with a \u00a33.99 in-app purchase unlocking everything.\n(Android/Apple \u2013 free) \n  Field trips and museum visits may be out of bounds for a while, but Google\u2019s Arts & Culture app at least has virtual tours of more than 1,200 museums and galleries. Children can look and read as well as curate their own lists of favourite artworks to share.\n(Android/Apple \u2013 subscription) \n  There are a number of great learn-to-code apps out there for children, but Mimo is one in particular that feels most connected to the world of professional programming. At a cost of \u00a38.49 a month, it offers quick but interesting exercises in languages including Python, Java and Swift.\n(Android/Apple \u2013 subscription) \n  Elevate is one of a clutch of quality brain-training apps (see also: Peak or Lumosity) full of mini-games designed to sharpen your memory, maths skills, focus and other mental skills. Like those other apps, it uses a subscription \u2013 \u00a338.99 a year \u2013 but with a week\u2019s trial to test it out.\n(Android/Apple \u2013 subscription) \n  If music lessons have gone out of the window, Simply Piano is one of the best app alternatives. It helps children (or adults!) to learn songs and then listens to their playing on any real piano or keyboard to give feedback. Two courses are free, but then it costs \u00a383.99 a year \u2013 pricey for an app, but not so much for piano lessons.\n(Android/Apple \u2013 \u00a32.99) \n  This is a history app focused on a range of famous women who \u201chelped us to understand our world better, and to make it a better place to live in\u201d. Rosa Parks, Marie Curie, Malala Yousafzai and Amelia Earhart are among the women profiled through animation and storytelling.\n(Android/Apple \u2013 free + in-app purchases) \n  Duolingo isn\u2019t just a fun and popular way to learn languages that children already study at school. It covers more than 30, including Arabic, Hindi, Hebrew and Welsh. It\u2019s well designed, rewarding short daily sessions of practice. It\u2019s free, but in-app purchases remove ads and unlock some extra features.\n(Android/Apple \u2013 free/subscription) \n  Kahoot! isn\u2019t just an app, it\u2019s also a website: a big collection of trivia quizzes created by other users. It\u2019s going to really come into its own as schools close. It\u2019s also a good group-learning experience: one person hosts a game and the others compete on their own devices.\n(Android/Apple/Amazon \u2013 free) \n  The TED talks archives are a wonderful repository of brain food for all ages \u2013 older children included. Search for history, science, nature \u2013 anything \u2013 and see what comes up. The talks are not all suitable for children, but many are.\n(Apple \u2013 free) \n  Swift is Apple\u2019s own programming language, and Swift Playgrounds is its app for teaching people how to use it. It\u2019s for adults as well as children, but it\u2019s certainly accessible for the latter, with its lessons presented as coding puzzles that will give people the skills needed to start making their own apps and games. It\u2019s on Apple\u2019s iPad, but not (yet) its iPhone.",

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.\u00a0Learn more.\nHoliday rental companies are among the many businesses facing losses since the UK went into lockdown last week. Some hosts saw a surge in interest at the start of the coronavirus outbreak, as international travel restrictions and flight cancellations were imposed, but sales are now falling dramatically.\nThe Guardian\u2019s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.\u00a0Learn more.\nIn a bid to keep business going, travel companies are calling on those with with existing bookings to change their dates rather than scrap trips altogether. Taking a holiday might still be a way off but many rental companies are now also offering increased flexibility when it comes to changing dates.\n\u201cThe best way to help the industry right now is to look ahead. It might feel like a strange time to book a holiday but do consider it if you can,\u201d said Mike Shields, managing director of Sawday\u2019s and Canopy & Stars. \u201cMany of our owners are offering vouchers or credit notes that can be redeemed at a later date and are a great way to show your support. It\u2019s encouraging to already see some of our owners are planning now for when we come out of the crisis, to take advantage of the likely pent-up demand and interest in staycations.\u201d\nThe instructions for reaching Darling How are clear: catch the Honister Rambler bus over the Whinlatter Pass from Keswick and ask the driver to drop you at the end of the forest track.Darling How is at the end of a forest track, then a further half-mile into the hills, almost surrounded by long-established pine plantations. On arrival, hunt down the key safe on one of the barn walls. With the wind moaning in the trees and the looming skyline to the west \u2013 the ridge formed by Graystones, Broad Fell and Lord\u2019s Seat \u2013 it feels properly remote, even though the owners do live next door, the only other humans within an hour\u2019s walk.\nThe cottage is perfectly snug: an air-source heat pump does the heavy lifting, while a logburner adds the final warm touches in the upstairs open-plan kitchen-diner-living area. Laminated maps and a full set of Wainwrights are on the window ledge awaiting the evening planning session, although the DVD selection might cause some distractions. Bedrooms and bathroom (with full-size bath, I\u2019m happy to see) are downstairs.\nNext day we settle on a circuit that will take us up the forested valley then out on the tops for a return along the ridge. However, when we get to the summit of Lord\u2019s Seat, the west wind is ferocious and has added a little scouring powder of hail that confuses the dog, Wilf. He can\u2019t walk into it and keep his eyes open, so closes them and stumbles around blindly. We huddle on the summit for a while, enjoying long vistas across the Solway Firth to Scotland, but the wind only gets stronger so we retreat back to the valley, missing out on that ridge. At this point the hot water and the bath are much appreciated. Darling How has definitely delivered on the remoteness, and provided the perfect amount of cosiness to best appreciate it.\n Sleeps 2, from \u00a3390 a week, sallyscottages.co.uk\nAcross Windermere on the western shores is the area where Beatrix Potter settled and began farming back in 1905 \u2013 when The Cragg was already long established. It\u2019s a big house, with a big slate-floored kitchen, lots of old beams, latched doors and window seats to gaze over the pretty garden.\nThis is an area of gentle walks rather than your big fell classics: head down to Esthwaite Water, or an old favourite, Claife Heights, which follows a lovely woodland way up to High Blind How with views over Windermere and several small tarns. In summer, this can be a busy area, but out of season it is wonderfully peaceful.\n Sleeps 8, from \u00a3586 a week, heartofthelakes.co.uk\nIf I had to pick a base for some great fell walks, The Byre would be a perfect location. It sits on a working farm right under St Sunday Crag and Kirkstone Pass, two places where I\u2019ve also enjoyed rock climbing and cycling challenges, and Helvellyn is also close at hand. The converted byre is on Deepdale Hall Farm, which dates back to the 17th century, and the farm location certainly enlivens most visitors\u2019 stays with its peacocks, Indian runner ducks and \u2013 of course \u2013 sheep. Inside The Byre it\u2019s a spacious open-plan conversion with leather sofas, oriental rugs on boards and a logburner. The bathroom has that essential post-long walk item, in my opinion at least: a bath.\n Sleeps 4, from \u00a3520 a week, sallyscottages.co.uk\nThe much-indented coastline of Cornwall does not easily lend itself to quick access by public transport, but in summer this gem of a lighthouse cottage is linked to Truro by three ferries. First, catch the service down the long fjord to Falmouth, nip across to St Mawes, then (having done your shop for the days ahead) jump on the Place Ferry across the Porth Creek, finally stepping off onto the Roseland peninsula. From there, you have a mile to walk on the access lane, or you can take the longer but more beautiful coastal path.\nThe reward for all this effort is clear when you first spot the lighthouse, perched on rocks above the sea, a fabulous white beacon of comfort and warmth. Inside, the place is well designed and practical, as befits a working lighthouse \u2013 there are even ear plugs for when the fog horn blows.\n Sleeps 4, from \u00a3928 a week, hostunusual.com\nSitting in delightful isolation amid Devon\u2019s fields is this handmade cabin with views down to the River Taw, a trout stream followed by the Tarka trail and the Tarka railway line, two rather large clues that this was the stomping ground of Henry Williamson\u2019s fictional otter. A firepit and hot tub sit a few steps away from this neat Scandinavian-style place complete with logburner and full-length glass doors looking out on the bucolic surroundings.\nThe first walk will be the mile up from King\u2019s Nympton station on the Exeter-Barnstaple route, and after that there are many trails through the woods and valleys of this tranquil corner of the county. It\u2019s on a working farm with a pedigree herd of Dexter cows, pigs and chickens that supply guests with some food, otherwise there\u2019s a 20-minute walk to a community shop. There\u2019s camping in the field, too, for a party too large for the cabin.\n Sleeps 4 (space for 2 more on an air mattress), from \u00a3135 a night, canopyandstars.co.uk\nI\u2019m pushing the limits on this one, since the walk is definitely over a mile, but what a walk! From Whitby set off southward along the cliffs, and be warned: the Dracula Steps up to the Abbey are steep \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t think of carrying anything but a rucksack. Once up, however, the Cleveland Way footpath is an undulating gem with magnificent sea views if the weather\u2019s good.\nThe lighthouse, a bright white structure sitting above a huge cliff, is a working building with an important navigation mark for mariners. Take binoculars \u2013 there are gannets and whales out there, and in winter short-eared owls hunt the tussocky clifftops. Peregrines are often spotted too \u2013 in fact, this is a birdwatcher\u2019s paradise. The cottage is a neat, bright apartment within the lighthouse complex with wonderful views.\n Sleeps 5, from \u00a3572 a week, ruralretreats.co.uk\nThe north Pembrokeshire coast is an old favourite, an exhilarating coastal path takes a rollercoaster ride across a panorama of savage cliffs and sandy bays, with the occasional neolithic monument as a landmark. Abermawr Cottage is a bit more than a one mile\u2019s walk from the nearest bus stop, but the rewards are great. Set in woodland, and it is equidistant (15 minutes) from two superb beaches: Abermawr and Aberbach, which will reliably give visitors either sun-blessed days on the pebbles and sand, or wild wind-blasted walks with an oxygen overdose. To be honest it\u2019s probably going to be the latter, but the former does happen.\nThe house itself is a single-storey place with large open-plan kitchen-diner-living space complete with log fire and a terrace. No neighbours. Nothing to disturb except birdsong.\n Sleeps 6, from \u00a3628 a week, qualitycottages.co.uk\nFor those aiming to get away from human contact and stay deep in nature, then Hutty, a two-person cabin, could be perfect. It sits in a 14-acre private nature reserve under the Preseli Hills, which the owners maintain alongside an organic farm and, to be truly perfectionist about this lack of human contact, there is no electricity but for the solar supply provided by an adapted boat switchboard. The loo and shower are a few steps away in the trees.\nThe hand-built cabin itself is a compact ergonomic gem of rustic creativity: recycled timber, a woodburner and a massive bed with windows all around for a bit of stargazing or nature-watching. There\u2019s a small deck for eating outside with views down to the meadows by the Cleddau Wen river. There are plenty of walks along the steep-sided rocky valley with various neolithic monuments to explore (this is the area where, 5,000 years ago, the builders of Stonehenge sourced their three-tonne bluestones).\n Sleeps 2, from \u00a385 a night, qualityunearthed.co.uk\nFor a cottage with an epic mountain challenge on its doorstep, Tigh Anndra is the one. The Trotternish peninsula, a 19-mile finger of basalt that juts off the jagged northern coast of Skye, is home to the Trotternish Ridge walk, a gargantuan 23-mile trek through some of Scotland\u2019s most magnificent scenery. Fortunately, there are shorter alternatives: anyone staying here will want to see the nearby Old Man of Storr, a famous pillar of rock, and the Quiraing, an area of strange rock formations created by an ancient landslip.\nThe house was once a shepherd\u2019s cottage and is a snug, stone-built retreat with a great patio view towards the hills. There\u2019s a logburner in the kitchen-diner-living room plus a TV and DVD, but no one would come here wanting to be indoors. The location is everything Access is by the bus from Portree, \u2013 just ask the driver to drop you at the door..\n Sleeps 2, from \u00a3279.50 for 3 nights in winter, \u00a3389 a week at other times, ihcottages.com\nMy commitment to public transport access reaches its ultimate destination: a cottage that looks like a railway signalbox.

        "content": "After Call the Midwife and Killing Eve, the Londoner has turned director with her own tale of violent female revenge\nWhen the camera follows a young woman as she staggers around a bar, slurring her words, she is conventionally marked out as a victim. A judgmental film director might even indicate she is deserving of scorn. But what if this vulnerable target is actually the one deciding who really deserves what \u2013 and then meting out her own brutal form of justice? This is the subversive premise of the directorial debut from the British actress, screenwriter and author Emerald Fennell.\nHer film, Promising Young Woman, is released next month and opens with scenes that show Cassie Thomas, a medical school dropout played by Carey Mulligan, apparently indulging in just the sort of self-destructive alcoholic behaviour seen recently from other modern anti-heroines, such as Rachel in The Girl on the Train, or the eponymous Daphne in the admired off-beat British film of 2017. The difference this time is that Cassie has been weaponised by a damaging experience in her past. And although she is clinging on to a job in a coffee shop and still living with her parents at 30, she is no longer anyone\u2019s victim. The result, according to the Telegraph\u2019s Robbie Collin is a \u201cwild and righteous provocation\u201d of a film.\nAs an actress Fennell will already be familiar to fans of either The Crown or Call the Midwife, where she has played, respectively, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, and Patsy the closet lesbian. But for this film she has not just stepped behind the camera as director, but also re-worked an existing screenplay to reflect contemporary attitudes and to puncture some common assumptions. At the Sundance film festival, where Promising Young Woman premiered this January, critics were ambushed by its unusual, dark tone. An editorial in the spring edition of the film magazine Little White Lies celebrated what several pundits have admired in the director\u2019s voice: \u201cFennell\u2019s pitch-black comedy is hard to stomach at times, but a piercing, vital addition to the growing canon of films that allow women to speak for themselves rather than through the gaze of men.\u201d\nIf the film\u2019s violent twist works with audiences, as many reviewers have been slightly surprised to admit, it could be because Fennell has made sure that her story does more than just chime with a worthy Times Up message. While other upcoming feminist offerings, such as the Weinstein-inspired drama The Assistant, starring Julia Garner and Matthew Macfadyen, are also set to give us leading women who are prepared to fight back, Fennell\u2019s debut feels like a more focused correction to some of the wicked fun she recently had working as the show-runner and lead writer on the second series of the wildly successful television show Killing Eve.\nBorn in London and educated at the exclusive Marlborough College and then at Oxford, Fennell was selected by Phoebe Waller-Bridge to take over the drama developed from Luke Jennings\u2019s novelas. It was an honour, in the light of the global impact of the show, and a demonstration of faith in another young female writer. In the end, Fennell\u2019s handling of the tale of the hitwoman and the obsessive sleuth hunting her down proved not quite as popular as the first series, but it continued to deliver a succession of stylishly amoral assassinations. Now, in Cassie, Fennell has found another violent leading lady, but one on a less random and more ethically nuanced mission to punish mankind. Not all men are guilty here, and appearances can deceive.\nAs the Guardian critic who saw Promising Young Woman at the film festival in Utah noted: \u201cOne of the film\u2019s aces is showing us that sexual assault can come in an innocuous package, from an Oxford shirt-wearing, soft-speaking \u2018nice\u2019 guy who can quickly flip into a destructive mode when he thinks the power is in his hands.\u201d\nSince Sundance the title of the film has been applied to Fennell herself several times. And if she still \u201cpromises\u201d much, she is clearly set to fulfil public expectation this year. \u201cFrom her work on Killing Eve to her short film Careful How You Go, Fennell has always demonstrated a fascination with the grey spaces of morality, and her debut feature is no exception \u2013 it\u2019s a meticulous, candy-coloured fairy tale with a blistering central performance from Carey Mulligan that\u2019s quite unlike anything she\u2019s done before. Provocative and recalcitrant, it\u2019s sure to spark plenty of debate, but also resonate with anyone who has seen their life (or, indeed, the life of someone they love) changed forever by rape,\u201d wrote film critic Hannah Woodhead.\nOthers, including the Hollywood News reviewer, have been less convinced by Mulligan as a malignant siren but are still intrigued by Fennell\u2019s film. \u201cLike everything here,\u201d the magazine declared, \u201c[Mulligan\u2019s] turn is skilful, entertaining and challenging, even when the eccentric method obscures the precise message.\u201d\nSo what exactly is this first time director\u2019s message? Well, it is clear Fennell loves to shock. That was an essential for the Killing Eve job, but also evident in the series of scary books she has written for children, starting with the spooky Shiverton Hall in 2013, and then in the mordant grimness of her 2015 novel Monsters, set in Cornwall. This adult book tells of two odd children who encounter a smattering of murders in beautiful Fowey. The acclaimed writer William Boyd was impressed when he reviewed if for the New Statesman. \u201cEmerald Fennell\u2019s Monsters is a tremendous, destabilising work of fiction, infusing the mundane with eerie and unsettling darkness it is written, moreover, in a remarkable tone of voice,\u201d he wrote.\nYet in person Fennell\u2019s jolly manner and upper crust vowels, to say nothing of her close association with Call the Midwife, might also qualify her as a favourite for the title of \u201cthe next Miranda Hart\u201d.\nAnd, rather like Hart, Fennell has been tweeting during the current lockdown in an attempt to distract and amuse her followers. Back in her family home, the entertainment has fairly been thin on the ground, she has suggested. A selection of gratuitous eBay purchases have sent her falling back on her lurid teenage library of romances and ghost stories.\nLast week, on \u201cDay 3 of self-isolation\u201d in her childhood bedroom she wondered: \u201cIs this how our civilisation ends? Wearing moisturiser that expired in 2008, the dregs of a bottle of Gucci Envy and fcuk t-shirt?\u201d\nFennell comes from a family she once colourfully described as full of wizards and circus performers but the financial anchor is father Theo Fennell, a multi-millionaire jeweller and maker of prestigious trophies, such as those handed out to Lewis Hamilton on the Formula One podium.\nThe world inhabited by Camilla Parker Bowles, n\u00e9e Shand, may not be Fennell\u2019s own, but it is probably closer than that of the midwife Patsy she played in Call the Midwife. She has spoken in the past of adoring the chance to work with the young babies who were cast as the newborns in the series.\nThe actress-writer-turned-director is also a huge fan of Roald Dahl\u2019s work, so let\u2019s hope there are a several volumes there still to divert her in her old bedroom tonight. Failing that, Fennell can perhaps download a few Britney songs to listen to. She is a devoted admirer of the performer and remembers crying with emotion as a young girl when the star burst onto the scene in sequins and spangles.",

Trump backed away from the idea after Cuomo likened it to a \u201cdeclaration of war\u201d by the federal government against the states.\n\u201cDue to extensive community transmission of Covid-19 in the area, CDC urges residents of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut to refrain from non-essential domestic travel for 14 days effective immediately,\u201d said the warning, issued late on Saturday, local time.\nThe travel advisory said employees of trucking, food supply, financial services and some other industries were exempt and state governors had full discretion over how to carry out the advisory. The United Nations, based in New York, donated 250,000 face masks to the city. Cuomo delayed the state\u2019s presidential primary from 28 April to 23 June.\nThe number of confirmed deaths in the US passed 2,000 on Saturday, more than double the level two days earlier. Worldwide infections surpassed 660,000 with more than 30,000 deaths, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. More than 135,000 people had recovered, it said.\nThe US has more than 120,000 reported cases, the greatest number in the world. Italy has more than 10,000 deaths, the most of any country, followed by Spain, China, Iran and France. The disease has spread to other major US cities including Detroit, New Orleans and Chicago and into rural America, where hotspots erupted in midwestern towns and Rocky Mountain ski resorts.\nThe Illinois governor, JB Pritzker, said an infant with Covid-19 had died in Chicago. In Detroit, which has a large low-income population, the death toll rose to 31, with 1,381 infections as of midday Saturday. The trajectory was more steep than that of New York, said Dr Teena Chopra, a director at the Detroit Medical Center.\nBritain\u2019s prime minister, Boris Johnson, who is in self-isolation with Covid-19, is to warn British households in a letter that the virus epidemic will get worse before it gets better and a tougher lockdown may be necessary.\nThe Zaandam cruise ship, which has hundreds of passengers on board including at least 130 with flu-like symptoms, has been granted passage through the Panama canal. Four people on the ship have died and two of those with symptoms have been diagnosed with Covid-19.\nElsewhere, the Russian prime minister, Mikhail Mishustin, ordered borders closed from Monday. Vietnam cut back domestic airline flights and ordered restaurants, shopping malls and other businesses deemed non-essential to close for at least two weeks. Gatherings of more than 20 people were banned and the government urged companies to allow employees to work from home if possible. Vietnam has quarantined nearly 60,000 people who entered the country from affected nations or had contact with infected people, according to the health ministry.\nOn the European continent, governments including Italy, Spain and France have continued lockdowns. Germany has fewer deaths than some neighbouring countries but 12 residents of a nursing home in the northern town of Wolfsburg have died since Monday, according to the DPA news agency.\nItaly has been under lockdown for almost three weeks. The prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, has signed a decree freeing up \u20ac400m (US$447m) for coupons and packages of food aid to be delivered door-to-door if necessary.\nNew Zealand reported its first death on Sunday, while in Australia the toll stood at 16 deaths from 3,809 confirmed cases.\nThailand has reported 143 new cases, bringing the total to 1,388, with one new death bringing total reported fatalities to seven.\nAs other governments tightened controls, China eased more restrictions following the Communist party\u2019s declaration of victory over the coronavirus. Subway and bus service resumed on Saturday in Wuhan, the centre of the global outbreak. Restrictions that bar Wuhan residents from leaving the surrounding province of Hubei are due to end on 8 April.",

        "content": "Fears rise that Beijing is stoking mistrust of foreigners as part of an attempt to rebuild a reputation tarnished by the coronavirus crisis\nOver the past few weeks, as Chinese health officials reported new \u201cimported\u201d coronavirus cases almost every day, foreigners living in the country have noticed a change. They have been turned away from restaurants, shops, gyms and hotels, subjected to further screening, yelled at by locals and avoided in public spaces.\n\u201cI\u2019m walking past someone, then they see my blue eyes and jump a foot back,\u201d said Andrew Hoban, 33, who is originally from Ireland and lives in Shanghai.\nExperiences range from socially awkward to xenophobic. An American walking with a group of foreigners in a park in Beijing saw a woman grab her child and run the other way. Others have described being called \u201cforeign trash\u201d. A recent online article, under an image of ship stacked with refuse being pushed away from China\u2019s coast, was headlined: \u201cBeware of a second outbreak started by foreign garbage.\u201d\nAs China moves towards getting back to normal after months of paralysis, authorities are focused on avoiding a second wave of infections from overseas.\nIn the last seven days, China has reported only six locally transmitted cases but dozens arriving from abroad. By last Thursday, officials had reported a total of 595 imported cases since the outbreak began, the main source being the UK. Observers say the focus on imported cases has led to an increase in anti-foreign sentiment, which according to some has been on the rise for years.\n\u201cThere is an effect when state media are reporting this is a foreign virus,\u201d said Jeremiah Jenne, an American historian living in Beijing. \u201cIt is a new variation of a familiar theme: don\u2019t trust foreigners. If there is another flare-up in China, the blame will fall on people coming from outside.\u201d\nLast Saturday, the country temporarily closed its borders to all foreign arrivals. Officials have also ordered local airlines to maintain only one route per country per week.\nSome say the focus on foreigners \u2013 surprising given that 90% of imported cases were Chinese passport holders, according to the country\u2019s foreign ministry \u2013 is the leadership\u2019s attempt to shore up its image.\n\u201cIf there is an opportunity to make themselves look strong, competent and legitimate by capitalising on public anxiety, they\u2019ll take it,\u201d said Mike Gow, a lecturer at Coventry University\u2019s School of Strategy and Leadership. \u201cIf that happens to stoke xenophobia, so be it.\u201d\nSeveral foreign residents stressed, however, that their experiences were not akin to those of Asians in the US and elsewhere, who have been beaten and subjected to racial slurs.\nBill Aitchison, 49, who is originally from the UK and lives between Xiamen and Nanjing, said: \u201cI haven\u2019t been attacked and haven\u2019t heard of any foreigners being attacked\u2026 but the virus has unleashed some ugly sentiments. When borders close and walls go up, it seems people everywhere are apt to see the virus in those who are unfamiliar.\u201d\nBut some foreign communities are experiencing more harassment. An African couple in Beijing were made to wait for two hours at a restaurant before a worker let slip that they were not supposed to allow in heiren \u2013 \u201cblack people\u201d.\n\u201cThe combination of pre-existing attitudes to race and Africans, plus this new wave of fear of foreigners, is making things worse,\u201d said Runako Celina, co-founder of Black Livity China, which documents experiences of Africans and people of African descent in China. \u201cDespite us doing this work steadily throughout the years, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s been a single period of time when we\u2019ve had as many racism [or] discrimination-related incidents from different people and provinces.\u201d\nOthers describe more scrutiny and wariness. American David Alexander, 32, who lives in the southern province of Jiangsu, said his Chinese co-workers had been advised to stay away from foreigners. In a shop last week, a couple waited until he had left before entering. \u201cThere is a sense of fear around foreigners,\u201d he said.\nA British-Canadian software engineer living in Shenzhen described being stopped several times by police and asked for her papers, something that did not happen before.\nThe issue is being replicated across Asia. In Vietnam, hostility toward foreigners has reached such a level that the Vietnamese ministry of foreign affairs issued a statement calling for it to stop.\n\u201cIt is our hope that the spirit of humanitarianism, equality and non-discrimination will be upheld by the entire international community, so that citizens from all countries and territories can enjoy security, safety and healthcare,\u201d the statement said.\nIn Thailand, a since-deleted Twitter account operated by the country\u2019s health minister reportedly said the country had to be \u201cmore careful of westerners than Asians\u201d because they \u201cnever shower\u201d or wear masks. He later denied writing the tweets. In Taiwan, some restaurants have reportedly said they will not serve foreign diners.\nBut several foreign residents in China said they did not feel unsafe, with the minor incidents they experienced not enough to make them reconsider living in China. Others said being treated like a pariah after having lived in the country for years was mostly disheartening.\nChris Lemos, 29, an American living in Shanghai, said he took a seat on the metro last week and a woman abruptly moved to the other side of the carriage.\nLemos, who had been in the city for three months, hunkering down at home to avoid falling ill or infecting others, had hoped for some solidarity. \u201cI was in the trenches with them, so to speak,\u201d he said.",

        "content": "Wherever you live, Britain\u2019s flora and fauna will be at their peak of activity during the nation\u2019s enforced isolation \nAt the risk of sounding smug, I\u2019ve never been so thankful that, a dozen or so years ago, I moved with my young family from London to the heart of Somerset. Like many city-dwellers who have made the change, I do sometimes miss the transport, theatres, cinemas and shops of the capital. Now that these are out of bounds for the foreseeable future, I value even more the things we moved here for: time, space, and nature.\nDuring the fine weather of the past week or so, mygarden has been alive with the sounds of spring. From my office window I can hear the metallic wheezing of a greenfinch, the metronomic sound of a chiffchaff calling out its name, trilling wrens, repetitive song thrushes, tuneful robins, and just now, a quartet of ravens high in the sky overhead, uttering their deep, croaking call. And this is not just at dawn and dusk \u2013 the traditional peak times for birdsong \u2013 but all day long.\nMy large, rural garden is a far cry from the place I grew up \u2013 a three-bed semi on a suburban housing estate with a small lawn and flowerbeds \u2013 and indeed very different from the various urban properties I lived in for much of my adult life. But nevertheless, when I did live in London, I used to see all sorts of wild creatures in, from and over my various gardens.\nOne advantage of city life is that most creatures are far less fearful of people in the urban jungle than they are in the countryside, meaning you can often get much closer to them. So, wherever you live in the UK \u2013 from the centre of the city to the heart of the country \u2013 there will always be plenty of wildlife on your doorstep.\nGiven that we are all now living under the equivalent of house arrest, I\u2019m thanking my lucky stars that this crisis has happened just as spring has sprung. Imagine if it had begun in November, when birdsong was non-existent, and the days were shortening. Instead, the timing could not be better, as nature nears its peak of activity. Over the next three months \u2013 which, God willing, will be all we have to spend in enforced isolation \u2013 Britain\u2019s fauna and flora will be flaunting itself as never before.\nMy teenagers appear to have locked themselves in their bedrooms for the duration, only emerging for meals or to walk the dog. So I have sympathy for those of you with young children, with their constant demands. The good news is that there\u2019s no better way to stave off boredom \u2013 and get them outdoors \u2013 than engaging their interest in the birds, bees and butterflies making their home in your garden. Keeping a nature diary, making notes and drawings of what you see, is also a great way to motivate them and to maintain your new interest.\nBefore you do, you need to persuade the wildlife to come to your doorstep. If you have never tried to attract birds to your garden, it\u2019s easier than you think. Just as we humans need food, drink and accommodation, so do they. So your mission \u2013 should you choose to accept it \u2013 is to create the avian equivalent of a five-star hotel and restaurant.\nThere are plenty of reputable mail order companies selling a selection of feeders and food \u2013 from a huge tubular apparatus to a small feeder that can be put on the outside of a window \u2013 so even if you don\u2019t have a garden, the birds will still come. But don\u2019t cut corners on quality: during the breeding season, when birds need to find natural food such as caterpillars for their chicks, they rely on high-energy foods like kibbled sunflower hearts.\nWater is equally important, especially during warm, dry weather. A bird bath serves a dual purpose: the birds can both drink and bathe, sprucing up their plumage so they can fly and feed more efficiently.\nIf you haven\u2019t already done so, it\u2019s perhaps a bit late to put up nestboxes, as resident birds such as blue and great tits will already have started prospecting for sites. But if you can get hold of one \u2013 or make it yourself \u2013 during the next few days it might still be worth doing so. Ideally, put it two or three metres up a tree or fence post, facing north or east (not south or west as the chicks may overheat in the sun).\nAlternatively, if you have shrubs and bushes in your garden, robins, dunnocks, wrens, blackbirds and song thrushes may already be nesting there. One way to tell if they are is to watch them closely: if you see a bird carrying items of food in its beak, it is almost certainly taking them back to its chicks.\nDon\u2019t forget to look above you. In towns and cities, house martins and then swifts will soon be with us, the latter tearing across the sky in tight-knit squadrons while uttering their screaming sounds. Here in Somerset, along with many people across the northern hemisphere, I\u2019m eagerly awaiting the first swallow returning from its African winter quarters.\nMany birds are visible all year round, but now that spring is here, insects are also beginning to emerge. Bumblebees are tough enough to have been on the wing since February: check out the colour and pattern on their abdomen (the rear end) to see which species are visiting your garden.\nButterflies are also out on warm, sunny days: many species love gardens as there are plenty of nectar-rich flowers for them to feed. So far only a few species have appeared, but over the next few weeks I\u2019m looking forward to catching up with orange-tip, speckled wood, common and holly blues, and red admirals \u2013 which fly here all the way from southern Europe and North Africa. The key to attracting these and other insects is to plant flowers: native varieties are best, but any nectar-bearing blooms will work.\nMammals are a lot trickier to see: even the really common species are often shy and mainly nocturnal. You may already be aware of foxes in your neighbourhood \u2013 and perhaps even badgers if there is a sett nearby. It\u2019s OK to feed them as long as you don\u2019t put the food too close to the house, and also avoid giving them items out of your hand.\nTo see smaller mammals such as wood mice, voles and shrews, you\u2019ll need to invest in a trail camera, so you can record what goes on in your garden while you are asleep, and then upload and watch the footage the next day. You will probably get lots of cats too.\nAnother largely nocturnal group of visitors to your garden are moths. Forget your hostility towards the handful of species whose caterpillars munch through your best woollens: moths are one of the most diverse, beautiful and fascinating creatures on the planet \u2013 yet most of us never even see them. To do so, simply wait until dusk, ideally on a warm, muggy and moonless night, and then shine a bright torch on to a white sheet. You\u2019ll be amazed at what you find: including impossibly huge and exotic hawkmoths, which are found throughout Britain, including in our towns and cities. Younger children are especially enchanted by these fascinating and mysterious creatures.\nThese wild visitors are much more interesting if you know what you are looking at so it\u2019s well worth investing in a decent pair of binoculars (for birds and mammals), and in two or three field guides for the key groups you want to identify. Make sure you choose those that only cover British wildlife (not Britain and Europe), otherwise you\u2019ll find that there are lots of species found only on the continent which we never see here at home.\nFor birds, I\u2019d recommend the RSPB\u2019s Pocket Guide, while for insects those from British Wildlife Publishing are superb. And there are sound guides available too, to help you identify birdsong. The downside is that, because of the increased demand for books and other products, it may take a few days or even weeks to get hold of some titles.\nBut why should you bother engaging with the natural world at all? Partly, for your own sanity: it is now proven that being in touch with nature \u2013 especially birdsong \u2013 is good for your health and wellbeing. Reducing stress and putting the world into perspective is exactly what we all need right now.\nNature needs us, too: we don\u2019t need reminding that we are living at a time of an even greater emergency \u2013 the climate crisis. The more we know about the natural world, the more we can help it \u2013 as Sir David Attenborough wisely noted, \u201cNo one will protect what they don\u2019t care about; and no one will care about what they have never experienced.\u201d\nFinally, appreciating the part nature plays in our lives is also, I would argue, an essential part of what makes us human. If any good can emerge from the current situation, then surely one outcome might be a greater appreciation of what nature means to us, and what, in turn, we can do for nature. And whatever the future holds, I promise that you will never ever regret engaging with the wildlife on your doorstep.\n Stephen Moss is an author and naturalist based in Somerset, who teaches an MA in Travel and Nature Writing at Bath Spa University. His latest book is The Accidental Countryside: Hidden Havens for Britain\u2019s Wildlife (Guardian Faber)\nWith its smart black, white yellow and green plumage and perky habits, the largest member of the tit family is found in most urban and rural gardens. Listen out for its syncopated song: \u201ctea-cher, tea-cher\u201d, with the stress on the second syllable \u2013 hence my children\u2019s name for it, the \u201cteacher bird\u201d.\nBritain\u2019s commonest bird is normally elusive, but much easier to see at this time of year, when the males make up to half-a-dozen nests before the female chooses her favourite. Look out for a tiny brown bird with whirring wings and, when it lands, a cocked tail; and listen for its loud, trilling song.\nFour species that overwinter as adults have already emerged: the peacock, small tortoiseshell, comma and bright yellow brimstone. And look out for the delightful orange-tip \u2013 like a cabbage white with Jaffa-coloured wingtips.\nIf you are lucky enough to have a garden pond, or just some water nearby, this is the peak time for our amphibian species to be laying their spawn \u2013 with tadpoles soon to follow.\nBritain\u2019s favourite bird is at its most belligerent, with the males chasing off any rivals that dare to invade their garden territory. Males are also the ones that sing that delicate, tuneful song; the females, which look identical, are busy building a nest.",

        "content": "As patients lie on floors, and nurses make gowns from rubbish bags, health workers vent their fury at a government fatally slow to react\nWith its lush indoor gardens, ornate pavilions and red carpet area, Madrid\u2019s Ifema convention centre was the impressive backdrop Spain showed the world last December, when the country took on last-minute hosting duties for the Cop25 climate summit.\nLast week the spotlight was on it once again, but for a far grimmer reason. As Spain becomes an increasingly worrying hotspot of the global pandemic, the Ifema centre has been turned, with help from the military, into one of the country\u2019s largest hospitals. Inside are thousands of beds, in row after precisely spaced row.\nSpain\u2019s Covid-19 death toll last week surpassed that of China, and is now second only to Italy\u2019s. Yesterday the number of deaths surged to a new record for the country, with 832 people dying in 24 hours. The virus has so far claimed 5,690 lives.\nThe figures last night prompted the prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, to tighten its lockdown and order all non-essential workers to stay at home for the next two weeks. In a televised address he said \u201cextraordinarily tough\u201d measures were needed as the county intensified its efforts to contain the pandemic.\nOne who died was Yolanda Cumia\u2019s father, Juan. Her last conversation with him was on 16 March, after the 87-year-old said he had hurt his foot after a fall at the care home where he lived. Hours later, at 2am, her phone rang again: it was a staff member telling her that her father had died.\nDays earlier, two people linked to the home had tested positive for Covid-19, and the invisible killer stampeded through the centre. \u201cShe told me: \u2018Yolanda, we\u2019re overwhelmed. From what I know, we have 15 people dead.\u2019\u201d The care home did not reply to a request for comment.\nCumia joined others in going public with the news as deaths at the 130-room home climbed to at least 17. Others chimed in with stories from across the country, painting a hazy picture of a contagion that had steadily preyed on the country\u2019s elderly, with ill-equipped staff the only line of defence.\nThe Spanish government turned to the military for help in disinfecting the residences. What they discovered horrified the country. \u201cThe army has seen some totally abandoned elderly people \u2013 even some who were dead in their beds,\u201d the country\u2019s defence minister, Margarita Robles, told broadcaster Telecinco.\nThe revelation was a blow to a country that has long prided itself on good treatment of its elders. \u201cThis is the generation that lived through a horrendous civil war and post-war era,\u201d said Cumia. \u201cAnd now they\u2019re dying alone.\u201d\nAs the country enters its third week of near-total lockdown, the number of confirmed cases has rocketed to 72,248. The actual figure is likely to be much higher, as people with mild symptoms have been told to self-isolate rather than seek testing.\nIn some cities the surge in cases has left the country\u2019s healthcare system \u2013 ranked among the top 20 in the world \u2013 on the edge of collapse, its defences already weakened by austerity measures that shaved billions from its budget.\n\u201cMine is supposed to be a 265-bed hospital, and today it has 700 patients,\u201d said doctor Ana Gim\u00e9nez of Madrid\u2019s Infanta Leonor hospital. \u201cHundreds of people are sitting in chairs or lying on the floor\u2026 all of the hospitals in Madrid are absolutely overwhelmed.\u201d\nThe situation is exacerbated by a lack of protective gear. \u201cWe don\u2019t have anything. We don\u2019t have masks, we don\u2019t have gloves, we don\u2019t have waterproof gowns. We have nothing,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are naked against the coronavirus.\u201d\nWhile Spaniards take nightly to their windows and balconies to applaud the efforts of healthcare workers, the government still promises that supplies are on the way. In the meantime, DIY solutions have proliferated, with healthcare workers sharing photos of rubbish bags fashioned into protective gowns.\nIt is little wonder, said Gim\u00e9nez, that healthcare workers in Spain account for 9,444 of the country\u2019s infected. Those killed by the virus include a nurse and two doctors. Many wonder if they are unwittingly acting as vectors for the virus. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m infecting my family, if I\u2019m infecting my colleagues,\u201d said Gim\u00e9nez, who suffered flu symptoms some 10 days ago.\nShe has yet to access a test, but her superiors \u2013 scrambling to meet the needs of a groaning system \u2013 have ordered people with mild symptoms to keep working, she said. \u201cThis is not only an epidemic of illness, it\u2019s an epidemic of really bad government.\u201d\nThe Spanish government had come under fire for being slow to react, allowing political rallies, football games and concerts even as neighbouring France banned large public gatherings.\nA delay in rolling out the lockdown allowed Madrile\u00f1os to leave the city en masse, spreading the virus to coasts and rural areas, while others packed into supermarkets to lay in supplies.\nThe consequences of these decisions have fallen on healthcare workers, forcing them into some of the toughest choices of their careers, said Gim\u00e9nez, recounting stories of doctors weighing patients\u2019 probability of survival in allocating ventilators. \u201cMost of us, every day we finish our shift and come back home crying.\u201d\nEarlier this month Gim\u00e9nez\u2019s union, Amyts, which represents doctors in Madrid, began offering free therapy to healthcare workers. \u201cEvery single day,\u201d said Gim\u00e9nez, \u201cone of my colleagues says, \u2018my mother died yesterday; my brother died yesterday\u2019.\u201d\nIn Igualada, near Barcelona, officials are frantically battling one of the world\u2019s deadliest outbreaks, their struggle compounded by steady reports of friends and family affected in the tight-knit community.\nIn one area, the daily death rate has hovered around 63.1 per 100,000 inhabitants \u2013 outstripping Madrid\u2019s 27.9 and that of northern Italy\u2019s Lombardy, Catalan authorities said.\nThe area went into lockdown days before the rest of Spain, with police stopping residents from leaving home except for essential work. \u201cThere is not any other territory that is locked down the way we are,\u201d said Mayor Marc Castells.\nA cluster of cases in the local hospital forced staff into quarantine and strained the already-stretched system. Of the area\u2019s 508 cases, 140 are healthcare workers. With help from charity Doctors without Borders, officials are working to transform a sports centre into a 100-bed field hospital.\nIt\u2019s a situation Castells never thought he or his city would find themselves in as he watched the virus begin its deadly rampage in Asia late last year. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot to handle, but we can\u2019t give in,\u201d he said. \u201cAs I like to say, we\u2019re not in a well. We\u2019re in a tunnel. We may not be able to see the exit right now, but there will be a light at the end.\u201d",

        "content": "I have stage IV cancer \u2013 and if I contracted Covid-19, I wouldn\u2019t pass a triage test. That\u2019s the bleak truth behind an increasingly surreal life\nThe first time my oncologist explained it I didn\u2019t understand. \u201cIf you get coronavirus I won\u2019t be able to get you a bed in the ICU,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s OK,\u201d I said cheerfully, imagining there would be abed somewhere else in the hospital in which I would lie coughing.\nIt was only when I put the phone down that her words hit home. What she was telling me wasn\u2019t that there were no beds in the ICU but that there were no beds for me specifically. As the possible peak of the disease approaches and doctors face increasingly difficult decisions, so wartime triage will come into play. As a patient with stage IV cancer I will not pass that triage test. My life will not be considered long enough to save.\nWhile they haven\u2019t spelled it out, this simple, bleak truth is largely what lies behind the government\u2019s shielding policy for people like me.\nThey are not so much shielding us because we will be worse-hit by the virus (although we may well be) as trying to prevent us from ever getting it. And they are doing this in order to ensure that the already overstretched and hardworking doctors of the NHS do not then have to condemn us to die.\nThis bleak realisation was just one moment in what has been an increasingly surreal week. The experience I share with everyone else \u2013 trying to adjust to working from home, in my case alongside my husband and two children, aged 12 and 10 \u2013 now runs side-by-side with the experience of being one of the vulnerable, who cannot take a daily walk outside, who must keep their children three footsteps away at all times, and who would be stuck inside my house for 12 weeks even if other restrictions were lifted.\nIn truth, my coronavirus paranoia had been raging for some time.\nOne of the strangest aspects is that no matter how terrible my situation seemed, I never entirely thought I was going to die.\nThere was always hope. Science was changing. New breakthroughs were coming all the time. Oncology is its own brand of witchcraft and there were always new spells to try. Checks and balances, different regimes and possible trials. When one chemo treatment started to stutter, my oncologist was always on hand with another suggestion, another tweak, another possible combination. It is 19 months since my triple negative breast cancer  was found to have spread and I am still alive.\nThen coronavirus arrived. At first I was furious. To have made it through 19 months of treatment for a particularly aggressive cancer only to succumb to something else entirely seemed too much to bear.\nThat anger was soon replaced by fear. I found myself interrogating every member of my family as soon as they stepped through the door. Who had they talked to? Was anyone ill? How much contact had they had? My daughter, getting the London underground to school every day, reported packed trains filled with people coughing. In the past I would have shrugged it off as the tail end of winter bugs but now\u2026\nI went into isolation. My husband had already decided to work from home, and I soon pulled my children from their schools, three days before the government shut them, worried that with each day my chances of survival were worsening.\nIt was only when we were all at home, rubbing along with only the occasional explosion, working and laughing and starting to enjoy the new regime of interesting movies each evening, that reality finally hit home.\nMy biggest concern wasn\u2019t the virus itself \u2013 it was the disease I already had. It was the fact that I still had to get treatments and tests and scans but now I had to do it in hospitals that were likely to become increasingly stretched, with staff who were themselves liable to fall ill. Because what you don\u2019t think about when you\u2019re living in a pandemic is that none of the other illnesses cease to exist. Car crashes still happen. Heart attacks still happen. Cancer patients continue to need those tweaks and adjustments that have continued to keep them alive.\nOn Tuesday I spoke to my oncologist. She had patients who were stopping treatment. Some had chosen to; others had been advised to. Everything was about relieving the NHS burden and protecting those most at risk. I am currently on oral chemo so she felt I should continue; however, she\u2019d prefer me to take a two months\u2019 supply and a series of injections to prevent me coming into the hospital during the worst. Oh, but before that could I come in on Friday, have a scan and give blood, just so they could see how my tumours were behaving?\nOn Friday I went to Charing Cross Hospital in west London. The usually bustling building resembled a ghost town. Waiting areas were empty, corridors deserted, the lift had one passenger: me. Signs everywhere reminded us to wash our hands. It felt eerily like being in the eye of a hurricane, that moment when the storm is all around but has yet to break, when the true horror has yet to come.\nYet it was also business as usual. My PET scan was straightforward (and quicker than it can be). My bloods were taken, my injection given. I went home having touched nothing and followed my oncologist\u2019s advice to wash everything I was wearing and have a shower.\nThen the bad news. The scan suggested the cancer, subdued for so long, is growing. The oral chemo may not hold it. Weekly intravenous chemo could be the only answer. But what of the surge? My oncologist stressed again as she had at the beginning of the week that there would be no ICU bed if I caught coronavirus. This time I wasn\u2019t confused.\nSo here we are. With 11 weeks of lockdown to go and the knowledge that I will probably spend every Friday, with face mask and gloves, crossing every finger and praying to every god, not just the Catholic one I was raised with, that the chemo works, that I don\u2019t get the virus, that the nurses and doctors, the physios and OTs, the receptionists and cleaners, the pharmacists and restaurant workers, all those people who keep the great machine of this great hospital ticking over, stay safe and well.\nThe rest of the time I\u2019ll probably fail to keep that three-step distance, hug my children a little closer, kiss my husband and continue the crash course in great movies that\u2019s going down so well.",

        "content": "The Sex and the City author has written her first \u2018overtly feminist\u2019 novel which details her own experiences of inappropriate male behaviour\nShe is famous for putting the sex lives of women firmly centre stage. Now, Candace Bushnell, author of Sex and the City and the inspiration for Carrie Bradshaw, has written a new novel based on her own experiences of inappropriate male behaviour, inspired by #MeToo.\nRules for Being a Girl, which will be published next month, is Bushnell\u2019s first work of fiction aimed at young adults. In it, a teen\u2019s life is turned upside down when her high school teacher attempts to kiss her, mirroring Bushnell\u2019s own experience at college, when professors making passes at her was \u201ca regular occurrence\u201d.\nBushnell told the Observer she and her co-author, the feminist teen writer Katie Cotugno had been inspired by the #MeToo movement and the real lives of teenage girls today. \u201cIt\u2019s more overtly feminist than my other books. There\u2019s an openness to these kinds of stories that wasn\u2019t there 10 years ago ... In the past, if you wanted to write something that was more feminist, you were highly discouraged by publishers.\u201d\nNow, more than 25 years since she started writing the column in the New York Observer that would become the smash-hit book and TV series, it is a more acceptable theme, she says. \u201cIt\u2019s something that young women are much more aware of. It seems like every generation has to relearn feminism.\u201d\nIf she were writing Sex and the City today, there would be much more discussion of #MeToo in there, she says. \u201cBut it reflected the time we were in \u2026 When I was writing Sex and the City back in the 90s, if you were a 30-something single childless woman, you were considered a bit of an outcast. And now, we consider that woman as the norm, as 50% of their demographic. We don\u2019t consider those women freaks.\u201d\nBushnell, who was born in Connecticut in 1958 and moved to New York in the 1970s, never had children herself and says she has never regretted her decision. \u201cThe opposite is true,\u201d she wrote on Twitter last year in response to a particularly gloating MailOnline headline.\nHer new book tries to warn girls born in the 21st century about the challenges they may face, in particular the sexist behaviour they encounter at school. \u201cOne of the things the book captures is typical high-school sexism. It can be a place that\u2019s very regimented in terms of what\u2019s acceptable behaviour for each sex,\u201d Bushnell said.\nThe protagonist, Marin, for example, begins to question the way her boyfriend and his friends treat her and how all the books she reads are by \u201cold white men\u201d. She starts a feminist book club at her school and publishes an article in her school paper, outlining the contradictory rules teenage girls are expected to live by. \u201cI think this is a book that hopefully, teenage girls will put down and say: \u2018hmm, this is something to think about, this is something to discuss\u2019,\u201d she said.\nBushnell says that, as a young woman, she had her \u201cfair share\u201d of powerful men propositioning her: \u201cIt didn\u2019t happen to me in high school, but it did happen quite a bit in college ... And it used to happen in the workplace all the time \u2013 to me, and to pretty much every other woman I know.\u201d\nShe began to notice a pattern in the behaviour of these men, which she details in her novel: \u201cIt always starts off with a little tiny thing, like they ask for a kiss or they try and get you alone. And you think: \u2018oh well, maybe that\u2019s OK.\u2019 And then it goes a little bit further. And a little bit further.\u201d\nAt the time, she says, \u201cyou didn\u2019t do anything about it. You just tried as politely as possible to say no, without pissing them off. Because if they got pissed off, that\u2019s it.\u201d These men were quite capable of handing out punishments to women who refused to sleep with them: \u201cIt was pretty common actually, for professors to have sex with their students ... [if you refused] they could give you bad grades and that kind of thing.\u201d\nShe wanted to reflect those experiences in Rules for Being a Girl, to prepare young women for the encounters they may face: \u201cIt\u2019s about being aware of these kinds of behaviours. It can happen to anybody. People often think: \u2018oh, it will never happen to me\u2019 but at first it\u2019s so subtle ... And if it wasn\u2019t for #MeToo, it would probably still be going on.\u201d\nShe thinks people are much more aware of what\u2019s unacceptable behaviour now and women feel more empowered to call it out: \u201cWhereas before, it was hushed up. You were told: don\u2019t say anything.\u201d\nFor example, in publishing, there was often pressure on female writers to sleep with the editor, she says. \u201cGetting the job in some way required stroking this guy\u2019s ego. I\u2019m not interested in doing that. Stroke my fucking ego. That\u2019s my feeling.\u201d",

        "content": "Mike Pompeo labelling the virus \u2018Chinese\u2019 has added to lack of international cooperation\nWhen the UN security council and the G7 group sought to agree a global response to the coronavirus pandemic, the efforts stumbled on the US insistence on describing the threat as distinctively Chinese.\nThere are other reasons for the lack of collaboration in the face of a global crisis, but the focus on labelling the virus Chinese and blaming China pursued by the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, helped ensure there would be no meaningful collective response from the world\u2019s most powerful nations.\nFor some US allies, the fixation on words at a time when the international order was arguably facing its greatest challenge since the second world war encapsulated the glaring absence of US leadership.\nAnd that absence was illustrated just as vividly by news coverage of planes full of medical supplies from China arriving in Italy, at a time when the US was quietly flying in half a million Italian-made diagnostic swabs for use in its own under-equipped health system and Donald Trump was on the phone to the South Korean president pressing him to send test kits.\n\u201cTo me what is so striking is the complete absence of the US from public debates. The US is basically off the map, and China very much is on the map,\u201d Nathalie Tocci, the director of the Italian Institute for International Affairs and a former EU policy adviser, said.\n\u201cWhatever happens in the US elections, what is happening now is going to linger on, simply because what we\u2019re going through now is such a traumatic experience \u2026 It is going to remain very much in our individual and collective memories.\u201d\nDuring the Ebola outbreak that began in 2014, the US was a highly visible leading presence on the ground in West Africa, sending emergency medics, troops and supplies. In sharp contrast, this week\u2019s $2tn stimulus bill contained scarcely more than $1bn (about 0.06%) for spending outside the US.\nThe state department pointed out that the US was separately spending $274m in emergency health and humanitarian assistance to help countries in need, on top of the funding to international organisations like the WHO.\nHowever, at a time when the scale of the damage is being measured in trillions, the additional aid has done little to soften the image of an administration that has employed xenophobic rhetoric and breaking with its closest partners in its efforts to intensify economic pressure on its enemies, Iran and Venezuela, whose populations are at high risk from the coronavirus.\nDespite its responsibility for allowing the virus to run rampant in the first place, China has had notable success in reshaping its image as a leader by its later efforts to contain the disease and its outreach to Italy and other vulnerable countries.\n\u201cUS global leadership won\u2019t just end because they bungled their response to the coronavirus, but I think we will come to find that this was a pivotal point,\u201d said Elisabeth Braw, the director of the Modern Deterrence Project at the Royal United Service Institute in London.\nBraw argued that the coronavirus crisis will inflict more lasting damage on the US\u2019s standing than the 2003 Iraq invasion.\n\u201cChina wasn\u2019t in the wings in 2003,\u201d she said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t ready to take over that global role. Well, it\u2019s now in a position where it can take over global leadership, and it\u2019s just waiting for the US to misstep or to lose support among its allies \u2026 And the past couple of years have really been beneficial to China from that perspective.\u201d\nFrom the debacle over testing to Trump\u2019s months-long denial about the scale of the threat and his constant political point-scoring, the US has showed itself to be anything but a model for the rest of the world to emulate.\nStephen Walt, a Harvard University professor of international relations, has argued that worldwide faith in US competence has been one of the pillars of its global standing, and is currently crumbling.\n\u201cFar from making \u2018America great again,\u2019 this epic policy failure will further tarnish the United States\u2019 reputation as a country that knows how to do things effectively,\u201d Walt wrote in Foreign Policy, in a commentary titled \u201cthe death of American competence\u201d.\nNot all global analysts look at the coronavirus as being so irreversibly negative for US standing in the world, pointing to more long-term trends, like US self-sufficiency in energy and its enduring economic, military and democratic advantages, as well China\u2019s many shortcomings as a credible alternative global leader.\n\u201cGeopolitics are not episodic. You cannot talk about geopolitics in two-week timescales,\u201d Parag Khanna, a former adviser to US forces who now runs a Singapore-based consulting company, FutureMap. \u201cThe power dynamics are what are fundamental, not whether or not China is sending lots of face masks to Africa.\u201d\nKhanna pointed out that China\u2019s neighbours in Asia are well aware that Beijing\u2019s censorship during the initial outbreak in Wuhan resulted in a missed opportunity to contain the virus, and that its diplomats have been spreading conspiracy theories about the origins of the disease.\n\u201cChina is filling a public goods vacuum, not a leadership vacuum,\u201d Khanna said. \u201cPeople here are not idiots. They know exactly where this came from, so you don\u2019t need to worry about China winning any global narrative campaign in the world.\u201d\nTocci argued that the extent to which China succeeds in exploiting the crisis to pursue global primacy would be dependent on whether Beijing can be successfully challenged, for example from a change to a more outward leadership in Washington, or a Europe that can transcend its divisions.\n\u201cIt basically depends on how everyone else reacts more than how China itself acts,\u201d Tocci said.",

        "content": "Some firms have stepped up to support employees, key workers and the NHS \u2013 but others have fallen well short\nThe dramatic effect of the coronavirus on the British economy has posed serious challenges for the country\u2019s companies and their employees. Some have been applauded for their actions \u2013 making donations to health workers, for instance \u2013 while others have quickly fallen foul of politicians, the public and their own workers. Here is a list of those who deserve plaudits and brickbats so far.\nCo-op The food retailer is taking on 5,000 extra store workers to cope with increased demand, offering temporary employment to hospitality workers who have lost their jobs. People can apply for jobs directly in their local branch. And the 6,500 pupils at 25 Co-op Academy schools who receive free school meals are being given a \u00a320 weekly voucher while schools remain shut.\nTimpson The retail chain, which provides shoe repair, dry cleaning and key-cutting services, says it will keep its 5,500 employees on full pay while its shops remain closed.\nLloyds Pharmacy The chain is hiring 1,500 staff so that it can continue delivering prescriptions and healthcare services. The company has also recruited 406 pharmacy students to bolster its staff.\nFullers The pub and hotel chain with over 400 sites has said it will not seek rent payments from its tenanted pubs.\nWhitbread The owner of the Premier Inn chain and restaurants including Beefeater and Brewers Fayre is putting some employees on a temporary furlough while its sites remain closed. But it will keep them on full pay by topping up the extra 20% of their wages not covered by the government scheme. Whitbread says it is in discussions with the government about providing rooms in its hotels, located near hospitals, to key workers.\nLeon The restaurant chain is keeping certain branches open to NHS employees and other key workers, and providing takeaway and delivery meals to NHS workers with a 50% discount. It is also bringing together other restaurants, food distributors and suppliers to deliver free daily hot meals to NHS critical care staff. FeedNHS \u2013 also backed by the Wasabi, Abokado and Franco Manca chains \u2013 will deliver 5,600 meals a day to five major hospitals belonging to two London healthcare trusts.\nPret a Manger Before the chain was ordered to close, it was offering free hot drinks and a 50% discount on all other purchases for all NHS workers.\nLloyds The bank has suspended 780 planned job cuts across its bank branches, amid a surge in demand and uncertainty over how many staff may need to self-isolate. An internal letter explained it was \u201cnot the right time, either for colleagues or for customers\u201d. Britain\u2019s biggest high street bank said it had granted mortgage holidays to over 70,000 customers in just over a week. The lender also confirmed that it would waive interest on arranged overdrafts up to \u00a3300 for all customers across its Lloyds, Halifax and Bank of Scotland branches from 6 April.\nHSBC The UK division donated \u00a31m to the National Emergencies Trust Coronavirus Appeal and British Red Cross to help support vulnerable people affected by Covid-19.\nBarclays The bank is automatically waiving interest on all overdrafts from 27 March to 30 April. It has also set up an online form for mortgage holiday applications to speed up the process.\nUnilever The company behind brands including Dove and Knorr is contributing \u20ac100m (\u00a389m) globally to fight the pandemic, including \u20ac50m (\u00a347m) worth of soap, sanitiser, bleach and food. The London-headquartered firm is adapting manufacturing lines to produce sanitiser for use in institutions such as hospitals. It has also pledged to pay its small- and medium-sized suppliers early to help their cashflow.\nJingye The Chinese company, which recently bought British Steel, sent a private jet filled with medical and protective equipment to the company\u2019s Scunthorpe steelworks. A private jet owned by Jingye landed at Doncaster Sheffield airport containing equipment including face masks, goggles, thermometers and medical gloves, destined for workers at the Scunthorpe blast furnace steelworks and the nearby hospital.\nMcCarthy & Stone The company, the biggest builder of retirement properties in the UK, has offered government and local authorities more than 300 newly completed apartments in unoccupied developments to house older people recovering from Covid-19 or NHS key workers.\nBrompton Bicycles The folding bicycle maker is providing 200 bikes to hire, free of charge, to NHS key workers.\nNCP The parking company extended its offer of free parking to NHS workers to all key workers.\nBritish Land The business, which owns shopping centres including Sheffield\u2019s Meadowhall, has said it will scrap rent for three months for small and medium-sized companies renting its space, and will allow larger tenants to spread their second-quarter rents payments over an 18 month window.\nFrasers Group Mike Ashley\u2019s business, which owns the Sports Direct chain, gave in to government pressure and closed all their shops after previously informing staff that branches should remain open, as selling sporting and fitness equipment was \u201cextremely important\u201d.\nFollowing the government shutdown, Sports Direct increased the prices of some products by as much as 50%. Ashley admitted that his business had been struggling to enforce the government\u2019s Covid-19 restrictions for thousands of workers at its Derbyshire warehouse, which continues to operate to fulfil online orders. The Unite union had written to the group about concerned employees at the Shirebrook site, who had reportedly been told they would be immediately fired for self-isolating.\nAshley issued a public apology for the firm\u2019s behaviour and said the company had since sought to make amends by offering its entire fleet of lorries to help deliver medical equipment and supplies for the NHS.\nB&M The discount retailer remains open as it stocks food and grocery items, as well as pet food. Staff have complained on social media about having to work without protective equipment, including in stores where groceries only account for one aisle. An \u201cadvice update\u201d to workers informed them that the company \u201cpresumed all our colleagues are key workers\u201d and that they would be paid for any time spent self-isolating, provided they qualified for statutory sick pay. Those who don\u2019t qualify or who had \u201cexhausted their statutory sick pay entitlement\u201d were told they would be contacted by their payroll adviser.\nJD Wetherspoon The pub chain\u2019s boss, Tim Martin, came in for widespread criticism after he said he wanted to keep all 867 locations open until the government-ordered shutdown of all hostelries. The backlash against JD Wetherspoon grew when it said it could not commit to paying its 43,000 employees beyond 24 March, before it had processed details of the government furlough scheme, as it didn\u2019t have the financial resources to do so.\nIt later changed tack and said it had created its own reimbursement scheme so that it could pay its workers on 3 April, provided the government backed its interpretation of the measures. The firm says it is retaining all staff and has advised those who want to apply to work for supermarkets during the current period that they will be given priority for jobs at Wetherspoons when pubs reopen. The chain has also told its suppliers that they cannot expect payment until after the pubs reopen, even for items that have already been delivered.\nTravelodge Hundreds of residents in its hotels, including homeless families housed there by local councils, were turned out on to the street after the budget hotel chain closed its premises. The firm gave letters to all residents asking them to leave as soon as possible, apparently in defiance of government guidance, which said that hotels looking after homeless families in temporary accommodation should not close.\nBritannia The hotel chain blamed an administrative error for sacking staff and leaving some without accommodation after it closed one of its properties in Scotland. It had terminated the employment of workers at the Coylumbridge hotel in Aviemore and asked them to leave their accommodation immediately.\nCarluccio\u2019s The Unite union has accused Carluccio\u2019s of \u201cwage theft\u201d after the Italian restaurant chain was closed due to the government-ordered shutdown. It claims workers have been informed they will only be paid 50% of their wages for the month of March, despite having worked until the chain\u2019s outlets closed on 20 March. The union believes the company\u2019s actions are a breach of employment law.\nEasyJet  The carrier\u2019s pilots and cabin crew have been asked to take three months\u2019 unpaid leave and accept a pay freeze. The airline came in for widespread criticism after it proceeded with a \u00a3174m dividend payout to shareholders, \u00a360m of which was paid to easyJet\u2019s founder, Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou.\nRyanair The low-cost airline has been accused of ripping off passengers after it was found to be charging \u00a380 more to those rebooking cancelled flights, even though it had offered fee-free changes. The Dublin-based company has waived its change fees, but passengers still have to pay the difference if the new fare is higher. According to consumer group Which?, the airline has increased the cost of those replacement flights by as much as \u00a380. Pay for all staff, including executives, has been cut by 50% for April and May, but the airline\u2019s boss Michael O\u2019Leary has not ruled out redundancies.\nRegus Small firms who rent office space from Regus, one of the largest providers of serviced offices, complain that they are still being charged rent even though they are not able to use their offices. The firm said it had seen an \u201cenormous growth in support needed\u201d in the weeks before the shutdown at the companies who rent space from them \u201cwith mail handling, internet services, and technology services that allow them to work efficiently\u201d.\nCineworld Former and current employees of the UK\u2019s largest cinema operator by market share have protested about their treatment by their employers. There was widespread outrage over the company\u2019s decision to terminate the employment \u201cwith immediate effect\u201d of staff working at both Cineworld and its \u201cboutique\u201d arm, Picturehouse. Cineworld Action Group posted an open letter to the chain\u2019s CEO Greidinger after the UK government\u2019s decision to pay 80% of employees\u2019 wages, but says Cineworld is yet to change tack and reinstate the employees it has made redundant.\nCapita Employees at several call centres run by the outsourcing firm got in touch with the Guardian to raise concerns that the company was not taking their safety seriously. One member of staff at a call centre in Runcorn operated by Capita said people were still taking calls for the mobile operator O2 involving retention of customers threatening to quit, complaining of a \u201cfilthy\u201d building, dirty toilets and empty hand sanitiser stations. They said they were concerned about catching the virus and giving it to family members with underlying health conditions and were too scared to speak out, as they could be fired.\nCapita said it had increased cleaning at sites, staff were working from home where possible, and it had no policy of sacking employees who complain on social media: \u201cThe top priority of Capita at this very difficult time is the wellbeing of our people.\u201d",

        "content": "Jesse Eisenberg and Imogen Poots are plunged into a suburban nightmare in this unsettling satire on consumerism\nIn one of the creepiest episodes of the vintage American TV series The Twilight Zone, residents of the apparently idyllic Peaksville find themselves cut off from the rest of the world, terrorised by the petulant yet godlike mind of a small child. Adapted from a story by Jerome Bixby, the episode (ironically entitled It\u2019s a Good Life) struck a chilling chord with audiences in 1961, watching from behind their picket fences, mesmerised by its darkly comic vision of a world in which failing to think happy thoughts was punishable by death, or worse.\nYou can see a trace of It\u2019s a Good Life (which has continued to resonate through popular culture) in Vivarium, the second feature from director Lorcan Finnegan and writer Garret Shanley, a paranoid fable in which the aspiration of acquiring a dream home turns into an increasingly surreal nightmare of imprisonment. Jesse Eisenberg and Imogen Poots (who recently co-starred in Riley Stearns\u2019s The Art of Self Defense) are Tom and Gemma, the young couple searching for a place of their own. She\u2019s a teacher, he\u2019s a tree surgeon; together, they have been urged to get on the property ladder. But finding the perfect place is proving tricky.\nWhen they meet creepy estate agent Martin, whose awkward unearthly smile wouldn\u2019t look out of place in a David Lynch remake of Galaxy Quest, the couple\u2019s instinct is to bolt. Instead (presumably driven by their desperation to become homeowners) they follow Martin to Yonder, a Stepford-style development outside the city (\u201cnear enough, and far enough \u2013 just the right distance\u201d). Here, they promptly become trapped in a maze of little boxes \u2013 endlessly reproduced rows of identical houses, all the same shade of sickly green, all with the same surgical strip of grass out front. And all eerily empty\u2026\nThe title Vivarium (a container for observing small animals in a re-creation of their natural environment) provides a signpost for where this is going. Suffice to say that Tom and Gemma find themselves in a pastel-coloured simulacrum of suburban hell, raising a monstrous child whose arrival is prefigured by a horrifying opening sequence of a cuckoo invading a nest, screaming to be fed by its bewildered surrogate mother. \u201cThat\u2019s nature,\u201d Gemma tells one of her young charges, \u201cthat\u2019s just the way things are,\u201d adding forlornly that \u201cit\u2019s only horrible sometimes\u201d.\nAs with all such Twilight Zone-style fantasies, it\u2019s the details we recognise that make the unimaginable seem immediate. While Yonder looks less like a set from The Truman Show than an infernal version of Teletubbyland (the digital landscapes and barrage-balloon clouds are appropriately artificial), the gradual disintegration of our central couple remains skin-crawlingly close to home. From their initial in-car bickering about who gets to drive (\u201cGive me a go,\u201d \u201cWhat are you, six?\u201d) to their chippy despair as entrapment sinks in, Tom and Gemma\u2019s relationship fractures along all too familiar lines. One minute they\u2019re happy-go-lucky young lovers, looking forward to a life filled with possibilities; the next, they\u2019re terrified, exhausted wrecks, held hostage by the shrieking demands of an alien child who mimics their every word and gesture, living in a dream-world neither of them wanted, each blaming the other for their predicament.\nIn his director statement, Finnegan (who reportedly drew tonal inspiration from Hiroshi Teshigahara\u2019s 1964 classic Woman in the Dunes) describes Vivarium as addressing the \u201cfantasy version of reality that we strive towards\u201d in world where \u201cconsumerism is consuming us\u201d, and in which the promise of ideal living is \u201cthe bait that leads many into a trap\u201d\u2019. There\u2019s an element of Cronenbergian revulsion in the tasteless, plasticated food parcels that keep Tom and Gemma alive, while the echoes of horror movies \u2013 from Village of the Damned to Poltergeist \u2013 increase as the satire turns ever more sinister. Yet even in its most overtly chilling moments (a third-act descent into hell recalls a memorably hallucinogenic sequence from Terry Gilliam\u2019s Brazil), Vivarium keeps its tongue placed firmly in its cheek, reminding me somewhat of the absurdist, smiling tone of Jocelyn DeBoer and Dawn Luebbe\u2019s recent picket-fence parody Greener Grass.\nYou can see the seeds of Vivarium in the ghost estates of Finnegan and Shanley\u2019s chilling 2012 short Foxes, and there are times this feels like a single idea stretched to feature length. But there\u2019s enough visual and thematic invention to keep viewers gripped and unsettled, particularly in these unprecedented, isolated times.\nVivarium is available to stream on all major platforms",

        "content": "Strange things happen in a crisis. For one, it can dawn on Mike Ashley that pretending that a sports shop is an essential public service is absurd. Friday\u2019s apology from the Sports Direct founder seemed to be more about communication \u2013 \u201cill-judged and poorly timed\u201d emails to overworked government ministers \u2013 than his original ludicrous attempt to keep his shops open, but it was still an uncharacteristic climbdown.\nEven JD Wetherspoon\u2019s Tim Martin, who has never previously appeared to give a damn what anyone thinks, paused to consider he may have made a mistake. Having announced staff would only be paid until the moment the pubs were shut, he then said they would get their wages at the next payroll date provided the government agreed a reimbursement scheme in time.\nCan anything be read into these examples? Perhaps not. It is possible that freewheeling entrepreneurs, and British business in general, will revert to pre-crisis ways when the coronavirus emergency passes. There will, after all, be huge pressure from investors to recover lost revenues and restore battered share prices in the recovery phase.\nBut, equally, this period of intense public scrutiny of business behaviour \u2013 where companies have been divided into heroes and villains \u2013 may produce lasting changes. One can speculate on a few.\nFirst, tolerance for corporate tax minimisation tactics will be roughly zero. The government will be facing a towering increase in public debt, plus a demand that more cash be spent on the NHS. It will need money from somewhere and could feel emboldened to chase perceived underpayers and financial engineers.\nSo look out, private equity: a tactic of loading companies with debt to minimise tax payments may no longer be tolerated. Corporate Britain has been running too lightly on its shock absorbers. A tax system that rewards well-capitalised firms that can withstand a crisis would be an obvious improvement.\nSecond, appetite for state interventions will increase. Train operating companies\u2019 franchises have been suspended for six months, but one doubts that rotten system will ever be restored. There is a strong case for seeing what the state can achieve instead. Privatised social care also looks ripe for a state takeover.\nThird, the balance of power could shift in the eternal battle over pay differentials. Will it still be considered acceptable for a chief executive to collect 100 times what the median worker in a firm is paid? Bosses at some firms have already volunteered for salary cuts during the crisis phase. Pressure to re-set pay arrangements permanently will be intense. Unions in the supermarket sector, for instance, would be well-advised to use the crisis to press for more for their members.\nFourth, big companies\u2019 treatment of suppliers may come under the microscope. The crisis has exposed the fragile position of small firms that trade with the giants of their industry. Supermarkets have generally behaved honourably by accelerating payments, but Wetherspoons\u2019 refusal to pay suppliers until pubs reopen was as shocking as its approach to staff. The government now has an opportunity to change the rules of the payments game.\nFinally, the big unknown is how, or if, consumers\u2019 behaviour will change. Cheap trainers and cheap beer have perennial appeal, so it\u2019s probably fanciful to think that Sports Direct and Wetherspoons will suffer a backlash that causes them real difficulty.\nAll the same, shoppers have had a rapid education in how companies behave when it matters most. Ethical radars have become more finely tuned. Companies that treat their workers and suppliers well should shout about it. They may find they are rewarded.\nThe economic contagion of the Covid-19 virus threatens to claim green investment as another casualty. Disruption to the environmental agenda is inevitable; the key question is whether the outbreak will slow the pace of clean energy developers for a few months only, or whether the renewable energy industry \u2013 and general progress towards green goals such as the Paris agreement \u2013 will be derailed for years.\nLast year was a record year forBritain\u2019s renewable energy generation in Britain: the UK\u2019s wind turbines, solar panels and bioenergy plants contributed more than a third of the nation\u2019s electricity. But if records are to continue being set in the UK, and across the world, then global leaders will need to make explicitly green policy choices.\nAt the most basic level, the clean energy industry will face the same hurdles as many other sectors in the wake of the pandemic: a reduced workforce; a reliance on vulnerable, concentrated manufacturing hubs; and a greater struggle to access finance. But even as restrictions ease, deeper challenges will remain. The companies that the world relies on to meet our green ambitions will be financially battered by this sudden crash and the collapse of commodity prices. Governments too will be stretched by demands for bailouts to keep economies afloat.\nThe answer must be to incentivise the progress of the clean energy industry by offering government support only to companies which promise to meet green targets. Airlines could commit to emissions reductions, carmakers to accelerating the shift to electric vehicles, and all companies should be sourcing at least some of their electricity from renewable generators.\nNo company should be offered access to taxpayer life-support without proof that they can help find the green shoots in the rubble of the global economy.\nThe shocking US unemployment figures reported last week only look like getting worse as March draws to a close. Jobless claims surged to almost 3.3 million in the week ending 21 March. This week, the workers who could not previously contact state agencies to register for unemployment will join those more recently laid off, potentially pushing the increase nearer to 6 million or 7 million.\nThe prospect of several months out of work will leave scars on a country where workers are expected to fund their skills training and education as much as their healthcare and housing.\nA $2 trillion bailout agreed by Congress that includes $250bn of cash to be paid directly to households is expected to limit the economic impact of Covid-19. It may also restrict the growth in unemployment if companies cut wages in the light of the government handout in order to keep staff on the payroll.\nWhat it won\u2019t do is leave workers in a position to simply pick up where they left off whenever the lockdown is lifted. Their employers may no longer exist. Their credit bills might have skyrocketed.\nThat is especially true when businesses are receiving mixed messages from local, state and federal officials. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow says a rebound in the US economy in the second half of the year is possible, once counties with only a few virus victims end their lockdowns. This analysis defies what we know about the virus and how it works.\nKudlow seems to believe the virus stops being transmitted when people cross county lines. Andrew Cuomo, the governor of New York, grappling with a major outbreak of Covid-19, would beg to differ.\nIt is a message that must change before too many business owners, increasingly sceptical of the advice from federal government, lay off staff at an even faster rate. If the US fails to stage a solid recovery, the rest of the world will struggle to mend itself.",

My boys are nearly 18 and 16, pretty much cooked.\nIt\u2019s a slow then all-at-once thing, this parenting business. The days felt interminable for years (there was a single afternoon in 2004 when they both had chickenpox that definitely took five years off my life; and time seemed to take on a hallucinatory, elastic quality as my elder son examined every knob and twiddly bit of every train in the London Transport Museum every week for a year), now suddenly there\u2019s no time left.\nI\u2019m feeling the same panicked incredulity I remember when we were inexplicably allowed to bring the eldest home from hospital with absolutely no child-wrangling experience. What, that\u2019s it? My boy turns 18 and I have to just let him go and be a person all by himself? Shouldn\u2019t the authorities stop this madness?\nPart of the panic is about how little I can still do in the short time I have left. What can I teach them before they leave? They can load a dishwasher (poorly), feed themselves (pretty well); they seem kind. That\u2019s the basics covered. When you\u2019re sending two more privileged white men out into the world, that seems like the least you can do. There are still surprises: I realised recently they don\u2019t know how to post a letter (they thought the postman collected it from your house). A tin without a ring pull and the concept of \u201ctin opener\u201d leaves one utterly bewildered \u2013 it\u2019s not a skill I thought he\u2019d particularly need: life moves fast. But they\u2019ll learn practical things I\u2019ve forgotten in the time-honoured manner \u2013 by making an absolute dog\u2019s breakfast of them a few times.\nWhat about the deeper stuff? The temptation to grasp them by the shoulder and deliver pearls of hard-won wisdom, like a pound shop Kipling, is almost overwhelming at times. Sometimes I get as far as the grasping, but faced with their bemused expressions, the only life advice that comes to mind is that offered by Bertie Wooster\u2019s Uncle Henry in PG Wodehouse\u2019s Carry on, Jeeves: \u201cIf you stand outside Romano\u2019s in the Strand, you can see the clock on the wall of the Law Courts down in Fleet Street\u2026 You can win a lot of money betting on it with fellows who haven\u2019t found it out.\u201d I accept this is of limited use and may indeed no longer be true (note to self: check this out).\nPart of the problem is that their father and I snuck in under the lowering garage door of an era where everything was still on a broadly hopeful trajectory. We studied without mountains of debt, found jobs easily, managed to buy a flat and chose, happily, to have them at a time of relative optimism.\nIt\u2019s strange watching them enter a world that has confounded our assumptions of progress: what could I possibly know about what lies ahead for them? The elder was supposed to be finishing A-Levels and going travelling: now he\u2019s facing months fighting for bandwidth and breathing space in a tiny house with his tedious #WFH parents.\nI don\u2019t, though, want to fall into shrugging helplessness, hoping their generation will sort everything out, somehow. Your mother grasping your shoulder then saying, \u201cWe\u2019re so sorry about everything\u201d probably isn\u2019t the cheeriest vibe either, even though I am, I really am. So instead I\u2019ve been trying to think what facts of life (no, not that kind, too late for that) might be helpful whatever their world looks like.\nThe only thing I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve learned from my myriad mistakes in 45 years is that life doesn\u2019t tend to have the neat narrative arc of a book or film. People would like it to: we\u2019re programmed to want tidy, satisfying stories. But a life is sprawling, inconclusive, confusing; punctuated by heady instants of joy and patches of sadness. There\u2019s a lot of grey in between and right now, there\u2019s whatever this is: exceptional, awful, hopefully once in a lifetime.\nWhen you know that, I think you\u2019re better equipped to ride out the bad and really live the good. When it comes down to it, your parents don\u2019t \u2013 or shouldn\u2019t \u2013 care about the narrative arc, but I think it often feels as if they (we) do. I actually think that even the well-intentioned \u201cWe just want you to be happy\u201d can be quite unhelpful: who the hell knows how to do that?\nThat\u2019s all I\u2019ve got, but the problem is I don\u2019t know how to pass it on. When\u2019s the right moment to tell my soon-to-be-gone son this? When I\u2019m asking about next year\u2019s gang awry plans with the subtlety of a wounded hippo? Shouting perimenopausally about the recycling? Or when we\u2019re slumped in front of the telly in relative peace? I\u2019m anxious not to make things weird, especially now: I just want to hold on to these moments, rest a hand on his giant knee, furtively look for echoes of his baby self in his all-grown-up face.\nSo instead, as he wanders through the kitchen, I slip him a pointless tenner and whisper the only other truly useful thing I know: \u201cYou can wash almost anything at 30C.\u201d\n@BelgianWaffling",

        "content": "Findings of critical care report raise concerns about how effective new facilities will be\nDetailed insight into the profile and outcome for patients placed in intensive care after being infected with Covid-19 has been revealed in a new report.\nData from the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre (ICNARC) showed that of 165 patients treated in critical care in England, Wales and Northern Ireland since the end of February, 79 died, while 86 survived and were discharged. The figures were taken from an audit of 775 people who have been or are in critical care with the disease, across 285 intensive care units. The remaining 610 patients continue to receive intensive care.\nWhile early data may not be indicative of the outcome for all patients, the potentially high death rate raises questions about how effective critical care will be in saving the lives of people struck down by the disease. As a top priority, the NHS is opening field hospitals in London, Birmingham and Manchester, which will incorporate some of the biggest critical care units ever seen in Britain.\n\u201cThe truth is that quite a lot of these individuals [in critical care] are going to die anyway and there is a fear that we are just ventilating them for the sake of it, for the sake of doing something for them, even though it won\u2019t be effective. That\u2019s a worry,\u201d one doctor said.\nThe report also found that though the majority of those who have died from coronavirus across the UK were over 70, nine of the 79 who died in intensive care were aged between 16 and 49, as were 28 of the 86 who survived.\nThe audit suggested that men are at much higher risk from the virus \u2013 seven in ten of all ICU patients were male, while 30% of men in critical care were under 60, compared to just 15% of women. Excess weight also appears to be a significant risk factor; over 70% of patients were overweight, obese or clinically obese on the body mass index scale.\nThe grim statistics were made public as a Tory MP who works in the NHS said that frontline health service staff who had no symptoms of Covid-19 but who might still be infected should be included among those to be tested to prevent the crisis getting worse.\nThe former health minister Dan Poulter, who works as a psychiatrist in wards with many cases of the virus, says widespread testing could be a \u201cgame-changer\u201d that would prevent staff who are asymptomatic carriers of the virus from passing it on to patients in hospital for other reasons.\nWidespread testing of those who are self-isolating with mild symptoms would also allow them to get back to work if they tested negative.\nWriting in the Observer, Poulter says: \u201cNHS staff sickness levels are already high, and they are only going to increase as the Covid-19 outbreak intensifies.\n\u201cMany of us are also worried that we may be infected, yet asymptomatic (showing no symptoms) and therefore could be a potential risk to our patients, colleagues and families. That is the last thing that we would want, but we simply do not know.\n\u201cWidespread NHS staff testing would be a game-changer and would help NHS clinicians to both protect our patients and return to the front line faster.\u201d\nHe says a lack of testing so far is causing medical staff to stay away from work with relatively minor symptoms which are probably not Covid-19 related, such as a sore throat, for fear they may have the virus. If they were to test negative they could return to work.\nMichael Gove, the cabinet office minister, said on Friday that extra testing would be carried out on NHS staff from this weekend. But he made it clear that this would initially be directed only at key NHS staff and care workers who were self-isolating. Many doctors, nurses and other staff want it extended to all frontline staff.\nPoulter suggests also that the government should be asking senior doctors for advice on how the pandemic will play out in hospitals, rather than relying only on experts who work away from the frontline.\n\u201cWe have many such clinicians already in senior leadership roles in hospitals throughout the country,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s time to better utilise their knowledge and experience.\u201d\n This article was amended on 30 March 2020. The headline and first paragraph referred to a 50% mortality/survival rate for coronavirus patients admitted to ICU. Calculations of case fatality rates are complex while an outbreak is ongoing and, although one method can be to divide the number of deaths by the number of deaths plus recovered patients (ie to look only at those patients for whom an outcome is known), its reliability depends on the extent to which the outcome for patients still in treatment can be assumed to be similar. The ICNARC report on which the article\u2019s calculations were based is early data in the Covid-19 outbreak. As such, a small sample of 165 patients, which could be biased towards the most and least severe cases, may not be indicative of the outcome for all those admitted to critical care. The headline, introduction and later reference to death rates have been amended accordingly.",

Women are still pregnant, still having babies, and they need the care and support of properly resourced maternity services.\n\u201cWe have to ensure that midwives and maternity support workers are ringfenced from any redeployment to ensure that women continue to receive safe care.\u201d\nA survey carried out last week by the RCM, and covering every region of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, found the 10% vacancy rate in midwifery posts before the crisis had doubled to 20%.\nMore than a fifth \u2013 22% \u2013 of survey respondents also reported that local midwife-led maternity units had closed. Almost a third (32%) had stopped offering home births, and a further 4% were limiting the option of giving birth at home.\nIn 11 cases, midwife-led maternity units had closed in order to increase facilities for assessing or caring for coronavirus patients.\nThe vast majority (78%) of midwifery leaders who responded to the survey said routine face-to-face antenatal and postnatal visits had ended, with a further 9% restricting face-to-face postnatal visits.\nA number of NHS trusts have suspended home births as the crisis has escalated, amid reports that a growing number of pregnant women are seeking to avoid giving birth in hospital due to pressures on the health service and the perceived risks of exposure to Covid-19.\nPrivate Midwives, a UK-based nationwide private midwifery service, said the number of inquiries it has received about home births has doubled in the past few weeks.\nThe Homerton hospital in Hackney, east London, said last week it could no longer offer home births because it could not rely on the London Ambulance Service to provide backup.\nNHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde suspended home births \u201cto allow us to concentrate our maternity staff in our hospitals to cover those who are absent from work because they are either self-isolating or symptomatic\u201d.\nWalton said: \u201cWhat this survey shows is that coronavirus is exposing the gaps that already exist in maternity services. The shortage of midwives has doubled since the start of the outbreak, a situation that is only likely to worsen.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cWe have to continue to provide the levels of care and support pregnant women need. The testing of NHS staff is an urgent priority.\u201d",

        "content": "Great Britain\u2019s hockey captain, who played a key part in the Rio gold, believes the postponement of the Olympics will give extra time to develop her young squad\nWhen Hollie Pearne-Webb was growing up, she had an indoor pastime that drove her mum potty. She had fallen hard for hockey from her very first session, as an eight-year-old, at the club near her Derbyshire home. Now she hated to be without a stick in her hand. \u201cI was always knocking around a ball inside the house, hitting things,\u201d says Pearne-Webb with a laugh.\nThe schoolgirl Hollie never imagined herself playing for the British women\u2019s hockey team, much less scoring the winning penalty in an Olympic final. But she would, at least, recognise the game Pearne-Webb has been playing on her living room carpet recently. Team GB have been training in isolation for the past fortnight \u2013 and not all of them have gardens.\nGreat Britain\u2019s captain has, so far, avoided breaking any furnishings. Most of her training is being done in her garage, converted into a makeshift gym, complete with stationary bike, bar weights and kettlebells borrowed from the neighbours. She had just finished a conditioning session when the news broke that this year\u2019s Olympic Games were to be postponed. She was expecting it \u2013 everyone in her team was. That didn\u2019t make the disappointment any less acute. \u201cEvery part of our life is geared towards going to the Olympic Games,\u201d says Pearne-Webb, \u201cso having that moved changes so much.\u201d\nFor athletes who have been mentally and physically readying themselves for peak performance in August, a 12-month delay can be a career-ender. \u201cThere are probably a few girls in the team wondering: \u2018Can I do this for another year?\u2019\u201d\nAndthen there\u2019s the prospect of no hockey for months. The longest an international player usually goes between games is two or three weeks: the current hiatus is likely to be \u201cmuch, much longer\u201d. Happily, the team remains fully funded until next March, but Pearne-Webb still has to find a way to captain a 25-strong squad who can\u2019t be near each other. Even her long-time mentor, Kate Richardson-Walsh, who led the team to their gold medal at the last Olympics, hasn\u2019t any experience in remote captaincy.\nLike any good leader, Pearne-Webb has already identified some positives. The delayed Games gives her and the coach, Mark Hager, another year to develop a young squad of players who have stuttered since Rio. After the retirements of the power couple Kate and Helen Richardson-Walsh, Pearne-Webb\u2019s England team were knocked out in the quarter-finals of their home World Cup in 2018.\nLast year, their coach in Rio, Danny Kerry, moved to oversee the men\u2019s side and under Hager England were routed 8-0 by Holland in a record defeat in their EuroHockey semi. Back-to-back wins against Chile last autumn, to qualify finally for Tokyo, came as a considerable relief.\nSo Pearne-Webb knows the bonding power of adversity. \u201cThese sort of things do gel you, going through tougher times. I know we\u2019ve felt that on the pitch throughout the last four years, which have been a bit of a rollercoaster. So although we\u2019re not together, team dynamics are pretty good and we\u2019re pulling each other along.\u201d\nThe 29-year-old has always seen herself as a temporary captain, caretaking the team until the return of her good friend Alex Danson. On a holiday in Kenya two years ago, a freak accident left Danson with mild brain trauma. That life-changing injury, combined with her sister, Claire, being paralysed after a cycling accident, finally caused Danson to retire from the sport in February. \u201cIt was only then it sunk in that I would be captaining the team to the Olympics,\u201d says Pearne-Webb. \u201cThen I started worrying: \u2018Am I doing what I should be? Am I doing a good job?\u2019\u201d\nHer self-doubts have been helped, she says, by listening to interviews given by Richardson-Walsh (\u201cI heard her saying she only felt she got the captaincy right within the last year\u201d) but those around her have no difficulty identifying her inspirational qualities. Pearne-Webb\u2019s never-say-die attitude was key to her side\u2019s Rio triumph, not least in their final match, where Great Britain spent most of the time against the Netherlands defending their hearts out. It was her ice-cool composure, taking the final penalty shuffle, that gave them victory.\nSo Pearne-Webb knows a bit about staying calm in a crisis. She\u2019s also an economics graduate and a part-time management accountant, working two days a week for the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs, where her role includes risk assessment and financial planning. \u201cAs someone who likes to know what\u2019s going on, the current situation is a challenge,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I\u2019m breaking it down on a daily and weekly basis, what can I do right now. I like structure and routine, so I\u2019ve been filling my calendar every night \u2013 work, study, training, lunch and a fresh-air slot where I go out for a ride on my road bike.\u201d\nWhile she finds the economic implications of the pandemic \u201creally quite scary\u201d, she has taken some comfort in the way it has inspired people to think about their physical activity. \u201cGoing outside once a day you see more people running than ever. I\u2019m hoping one of the things to come out of this is people finding a little bit more time for themselves.\u201d\nGender equality is another of Pearne-Webb\u2019s concerns \u2013 hockey is a rare team sport in which male and female internationals are paid the same. In January she joined the Women\u2019s Sport Trust\u2019s Unlock campaign, aimed at breaking down the barriers that still remain for women\u2019s sport. She foresees a real danger that recent improvements in its funding and profile could suffer in an economic downturn. \u201cIt is a worry that all the hard work and the years it\u2019s taken to get to this point could be lost.\u201d\nBefore then, however, there are some more immediate priorities. These include redecorating her hallway (she finds DIY therapeutic) and gym sessions with her ready-made training partner \u2013 her husband, Tom, who secretly wishes he was a professional athlete himself. And if the BBC does respond to requests to replay past Olympic triumphs to boost the nation\u2019s spirits, there\u2019s a good chance we\u2019ll get to see Pearne-Webb in action again. \u201cIt would be great if they replayed the Rio final,\u201d she says with a smile. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve actually seen it.\u201d",

        "content": "Boxing promoter Eddie Hearn is one of the sport\u2019s most colourful characters and his big-money fights have become world events. But there\u2019s one battle he\u2019ll never win \u2013 trying to outsmart his father Barry\nThe boxing promoter Eddie Hearn is telling the world what it wants to hear, live on national television. It is early on a Monday morning. Hearn is in the Hearn family offices, a converted pile outside Brentwood, rural Essex, that was once the Hearn family home, pre-conversion.\n\u201cLook,\u201d he says.\nHe is talking directly to camera, speaking live to a news anchor down the line.\n\u201cEverybody knows this is a monstrous fight. It makes perfect sense. How could it not make perfect sense?\u201d\nIt is 24 hours after Tyson Fury boxed Deontay Wilder in a big-money Las Vegas brawl. Fury won, convincingly. Now the news channels are asking about the heavyweight division\u2019s other premium fighter, Anthony Joshua, who happens to be Hearn\u2019s marquee client. Will Joshua fight Fury now? Can Hearn make it happen?\n\u201cLet\u2019s have it right,\u201d Hearn says.\nHere he is, a salesman in his element, a heavyweight chatterbox dangling a deal.\n\u201cWe have an opportunity to make an event,\u201d he says. \u201cNot just the biggest event in British boxing history, but one of the biggest sporting events\u201d \u2013 pause \u2013 \u201cof all time.\u201d\nHearn is not a man to tone down the hyperbole. Nor does he turn down the opportunity to talk. \u201cI\u2019ll do every interview in the line,\u201d he says, of his commitment to promotion, \u201cand I\u2019ll get to the end and it\u2019s some geezer from\u2026 \u2018Frank\u2019s Boxing Hour\u2019?\u201d He doesn\u2019t have it in him to turn requests down, he says, even when the requests come from amateur YouTubers. But, you know, all publicity is good publicity. After big fights, news channels clamour for Hearn\u2019s take, not just because he is a grade-A gabber \u2013 which he is, a truly exceptional gabber \u2013 but because his interviews get traction, particularly when they\u2019re chopped up and shared across social media.\nAlmost a million people follow Hearn on Twitter, where he delivers lines with the charm and swagger of a star performer. Some 350,000 people follow an Eddie Hearn fan account that reduces his soundbites to memes. Thanks in part to his social media persona \u2013 performative, nearly always delighted at something, game for a laugh \u2013 but also to the recent resurgence of the heavyweight division as a popular spectacle, Hearn has shot comet-like over the threshold of boxing and into the public consciousness, and established himself as one of the loudest voices in sports. These days, he turns up, almost miraculously, everywhere: on the news, at weigh-ins, on a talkshow, at press conferences, on your partner\u2019s Instagram feed (telling jokes, from quarantine). He can come across as a combination of businessman and comedian \u2013 a mostly serious man with a side-hustle in laughs. His company, Matchroom Boxing, promotes more than 90 boxers, including several world champions. But of late it has seemed as though Hearn has become more famous than most of his clients.\nHearn refers to himself as \u201ca travelling salesman\u201d \u2013 his schedule, these days, is not carbon efficient \u2013 though really he\u2019d like to be remembered for being an outstanding man of business. Some people see him like that. Others think of him as a kind of Essex wide boy, a chancer, ready to pull the wool over your eyes.\nThe latter take is simplistic. Hearn has sold out events at Wembley and Madison Square Garden. He was the first promoter to make a $1bn streaming deal, with the on-demand service DAZN, and the only boxing promoter to have organised a big-money event in the Middle East (still controversial). He excels at twisting negotiations to benefit the boxers he promotes, particularly their wallets, and subsequently his own, and he is expert at conjuring stories to pitch fights to audiences, especially to those who are only casually interested in boxing. \u201cI love to sell,\u201d he says. \u201cI love to make money. But it\u2019s not just about that. It\u2019s about the achievement of making a breakthrough.\u201d\nOn days like today, the days after big fights, Hearn is dramatically busy. The machine must whir into action; a narrative must be shaped. (\u201cNarratives are the most important thing in selling a live sporting event!\u201d) When we meet, he has only recently returned from Dubai (family holiday; he took meetings), and he\u2019ll soon fly to Dallas (work). This morning, he has accepted several interview requests \u2013 never say no! \u2013 though he has rejected one, an exception, from Good Morning Britain.\n\u201cThey asked me to come on with Fury\u2019s dad,\u201d Hearn says. He is incredulous. \u201cI mean, fucking hell! These people are so naff. It\u2019s like they literally just want to get you having a row.\u201d\nI\u2019ve come to ask Hearn about all of this. How he has become a near-permanent fixture in the public eye. How he has transformed from chatty sports promoter into mainstream celebrity, invited on to morning chat shows and cult-followed on Twitter. How he has become more famous than many of his clients, even though they employ him to promote them. I want to ask why he thinks this has all happened. Whether or not it\u2019s been part of some grand plan.\nBut I can\u2019t, because Eddie\u2019s dad Barry has turned up wanting to know when Eddie will be finished with all the interviews.\n\u201cYou like the look of my office?\u201d the promoter Barry Hearn says.\nBarry\u2019s office is the nicest at Hearn HQ, which is why Eddie decided to film his interviews there.\nEddie shrugs. \u201cWe needed to do some work.\u201d\nBarry is still technically Eddie\u2019s boss. Matchroom Boxing is a subsidiary of Matchroom Sport, a firm Barry set up in the 1980s and which he still runs. It was Matchroom Sport that gave snooker its big mainstream break, and who later promoted Chris Eubank and Frank Bruno. Eddie still defers to Barry, even though Barry, who is 71, is slowly beginning to cool it with the business stuff, and Eddie, who is 40, is really just getting going.\n\u201cI appreciate that I\u2019m working for my son these days,\u201d Barry says.\nHe looks at the crowd following Eddie around \u2013 the camera crews, Eddie\u2019s PR guys, me \u2013 then launches into the role of embarrassing dad.\n\u201cWhen he was younger,\u201d Barry says, \u201che used to tell the birds that he owned this house.\u201d\nThere is laughter, not from Eddie. Eddie is wincing at the memory, like, \u201cCome on, Dad\u201d. Barry is all smiles. When he eventually scoots off, an aide thanks him for letting them use his office. Barry grins. Then, without missing a beat, he says: \u201cThere\u2019ll be an invoice coming, you know.\u201d\nWhen Hearn was growing up, he and his dad were relentlessly competitive, and, without prompting, their relationship colours the span of our conversation. \u201cWe sparred at 15,\u201d Eddie says. \u201cWe beat the life out of each other in the ring.\u201d Barry came from a Dagenham council estate and made good. Eddie went to a private school and lived in a stately home. \u201cHe was petrified that I would become all the things he\u2019d hated growing up,\u201d Hearn says. \u201cThe only kid at school with money. The kid at school who\u2019s a bit flash and brash.\u201d Barry still calls Eddie \u201csilver spoon\u201d. \u201cHe was so obsessed with that. With the worry of me being, you know, that kid.\u201d\nTo instil a work ethic, Barry would make Eddie do odd jobs: he shined Barry\u2019s shoes, he cleaned Barry\u2019s car. \u201cHe made me his hobby,\u201d Hearn says. \u201cHis little project. \u2018I\u2019m going to build you in a way where you\u2019re going to be dangerous. You\u2019re going to be good at what you do.\u2019\u201d At one point, Barry had Eddie rifling through the Yellow Pages, so he could cold-call businesses with sponsorship offers. Eddie was still a kid. (The younger Hearn now uses similar tactics with his own kids, two daughters, though he is less exacting.) By 15, Eddie was selling double glazing over the phone. By his early 20s he\u2019d worked at a sports management company, representing golfers, then found his way back to the family business, where he\u2019d belonged all along.\nWhen Hearn was selling windows, cold-calling people in their homes (\u201cThe most unbelievable schooling for selling!\u201d), Hearn could take the rejections, of which there were many, one after the other \u2013 they made the wins sweeter. What he couldn\u2019t accept was people always reacting to him as though he\u2019d only made it because of his dad.\n\u201cI think a lot of it was just a chip on my shoulder of growing up as Barry Hearn\u2019s son,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you come from money, people automatically resent you. They think you get opportunities that other people haven\u2019t. True! But you play the hand you\u2019re dealt with.\u201d\nAt one point, Hearn mentions he feels \u201cmanufactured\u201d. I say it sounds like Barry wanted to create another Barry.\n\u201cI think secretly what he\u2019s most proud of is that I work as hard as him,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a responsibility, that I have to continue the legacy.\u201d\nThen he adds something odd.\n\u201cOne thing I\u2019m jealous of is that I never got to make it from nothing. I believe I would have, but I never got the chance. He\u2019s 71 and he still can\u2019t believe what he\u2019s achieved because of where he came from. But I grew up here\u201d \u2013 he points around the office \u2013 \u201cyou know what I mean? So, although I\u2019m grateful, it\u2019s kind of like I didn\u2019t get that opportunity.\u201d\nThis seems ridiculous to me, to complain about not being given the opportunity to grow up less privileged. I ask him why that\u2019s a problem.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a problem,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s just something I would have liked to have achieved. That\u2019s the one criticism I will always get\u2026\u201d That he got a head start. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m so driven to take this to levels beyond anything he could have ever done. How can I be a success if I just maintain the market position? Or don\u2019t show international growth? Or don\u2019t produce the numbers he could never have produced? That\u2019s the competitive instinct between us. It\u2019s like, \u2018Come on then, son. Let\u2019s see what you\u2019re made of.\u2019\u201d\nI ask if he\u2019s constantly trying to prove himself to his dad.\n\u201cYeah, I think so,\u201d he says. \u201cSubconsciously.\u201d\nDo you ever think you will? \u201cI think I have!\u201d he says. \u201cHe would never have expected me to achieve what we\u2019ve achieved, because he couldn\u2019t do it. Again, I know I had a head start, but he never got a US TV deal. He never sold out Wembley. He never did a big site deal with the Middle East and got tens of millions out of them.\u201d\nHearn wants to be bigger than his dad. Be greater. \u201cHis mentality,\u201d Hearn says, \u201cwas always like, he couldn\u2019t believe how well it was going. It was like, \u2018Fuck, whatever you do, don\u2019t rock the ship. Don\u2019t fuck it up!\u2019\u201d That\u2019s not Hearn\u2019s approach. \u201cI\u2019m saying, \u2018How do we go international? Into different markets?\u2019 That\u2019s the strategy for us. People say, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re not interested in UK boxing any more.\u2019 I am! But I\u2019m not going to restrict myself to one market.\u201d\nHearn puts on shows in the US, the UK, central Europe and the Middle East (a hard sell to human rights organisations, but, in his thinking: who is he to tell a boxer he can\u2019t fight somewhere when it means them turning down \u201cthe kind of money that secures generational wealth\u201d?) \u201cWe\u2019ve built a business and we\u2019ve built reserves and we\u2019ve built wealth to a point where nothing can hurt us,\u201d Hearn says. \u201cThe best money to have is \u2018fuck-you\u2019 money, which means you can\u2019t hurt. If I lose a fight\u201d \u2013 if a fight is cancelled, due to a pandemic, say \u2013 \u201cor a broadcast deal, we\u2019re OK, you know? We could walk away tomorrow.\u201d\nI ask whether he really would.\nHe says no.\nThen I ask him if it\u2019s because he enjoys the limelight.\n\u201cI used to,\u201d he says. \u201cI used to enjoy it. I think it\u2019s become, it sounds a bit arrogant, but it\u2019s become a little bit intrusive. I\u2019m a showman. I can\u2019t say I don\u2019t enjoy the limelight. I guess I do. But I do notice now that\u2026\u201d It\u2019s tough for him to go out with his family without getting bothered, he says. People point at him. People stop him in the street. He prefers not to get the tube now, because inevitably one person will recognise him and before long the whole carriage knows who he is. \u201cIt\u2019s just part of what you do,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can\u2019t have it both ways. All these celebrities who say, \u2018Oh, you know, I\u2019m getting terrible comments on social media.\u2019 Well, you signed up for it! I\u2019ve put myself in front of the camera. I waffle all day. People are going to be opinionated.\u201d He\u2019s stopped using social media as much as he used to for the same reason \u2013 people get on his back, for all the wrong reasons, he says. And they are not always gracious. \u201cIt\u2019s the Twitter thing.\u201d He means the fan account, the one that reduces him to memes. \u201cIt\u2019s made it 10 times worse.\u201d\nWorse?\n\u201cWorse! Because they don\u2019t even know who I am. I\u2019m just that guy off Twitter. I can\u2019t knock it\u2026\u201d\nIt\u2019s funny, I say.\n\u201cIt is, but it used to be a sports fan, right? Now it\u2019s someone\u2019s wife or girlfriend whose husband sent them a clip of me. \u2018Oh, that\u2019s that fucking guy.\u2019 So it\u2019s funny in a way. But it\u2019s, like, draining.\u201d\nI say that this is part of his new celebrity status.\n\u201cI don\u2019t look at it like that,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t like to call myself a celebrity. I don\u2019t want to be a celebrity. I really don\u2019t. I want to be a businessman.\u201d\nIt wasn\u2019t part of the plan to become well-known?\n\u201cNo, never,\u201d he says. \u201cThere was a plan to be vocal. To have a voice. But now I\u2019m getting approached to do TV shows with terrestrial broadcasters and it\u2019s, like, hang on a minute, my job is to promote my client, right? I don\u2019t want to be the star. I want to be the mouthpiece to make them a star.\u201d He is musing. \u201cIf I can drive a bigger fan base to the sport by being a little bit of a celebrity, that\u2019s fine. But if I\u2019m a fighter, and I\u2019m starting to think, \u2018Fucking hell, this guy\u2019s bigger than me\u2026\u2019 That\u2019s never been the aim. That\u2019s never been the plan.\u201d\nHearn has a catch-all approach to the press: \u201cUse me and abuse me.\u201d (He also likes to say: \u201cI\u2019m the guy they wheel out.\u201d) But, more and more, the press he does has to be the right kind. \u201cI want to be someone respected for changing the sport,\u201d he says. \u201cNot, \u2018Oh, he was the guy on the\u2026\u2019 I\u2019m conscious of that. I don\u2019t want to be\u2026 jokey.\u201d He\u2019s considering this, how much to give of himself. \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve turned down adverts with major brands!\u201d\nDoes he worry about failure? He says no, but then he launches into a whole spiel about it. \u201cI worry about not winning,\u201d he says. \u201cNot winning as in not being the best, you know? Not being number one.\u201d Hearn sets targets every year, and every year the targets get higher, \u201cand the fear of failure for me is not achieving those goals. It\u2019s about how big we can be, how slick we can be.\u201d\nHearn is incredibly self-critical. When people tell him he\u2019s done a good job, he won\u2019t believe it. \u201cIt\u2019s sad in a way,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m probably not enjoying things the way I should. But it keeps me wanting more.\u201d He\u2019s rarely happy; small mistakes consume him. \u201cThe only way you can achieve greatness is to be a perfectionist in everything you do,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you\u2019re not striving for the perfect performance, or the perfect product, or whatever it is, how do you really achieve greatness?\u201d\nHearn talks a lot about greatness. I ask him if he wants to be remembered for being great. At first he says no, that he just wants to be remembered. But then he realises that just being remembered probably isn\u2019t enough. \u201cRespect,\u201d he says. \u201cRespect is a good word.\u201d Then he changes his mind again. \u201cProbably the best thing would be, \u2018He didn\u2019t stop. He was relentless.\u2019 That\u2019s a word me and my dad use a lot: relentless. Relentless is a word I prefer to greatness. Greatness is an opinion. Relentless doesn\u2019t have to be an opinion. It can be fact.\u201d",

        "content": "The British Horseracing Authority\u2019s overall plan to steer the sport and \n industry through the coronavirus pandemic became much clearer in the space of a couple of hours on Friday evening. First, the sport\u2019s ruling body announced plans to strip around \u00a31m from its monthly \u00a33m budget, while shortly afterwards the trainer Ralph Beckett tweeted the text of a letter sent to stakeholders by Brant Dunshea, the BHA\u2019s chief regulatory officer, which included a statement that the Authority\u2019s Resumption of Racing Group \u201cis planning for a resumption from the 1st of May\u201d.\nAll British racing was suspended on 17 March after a short-lived attempt to run meetings behind closed doors. The country has since moved into strict lockdown amid increasingly severe controls on commercial activity, movement and social distancing, in anticipation of an expected peak in Covid-19 cases in two to three weeks\u2019 time. As a result, many in the sport have assumed that the initial suspension of racing until 30 April would inevitably be extended.\nAs Dunshea\u2019s letter makes clear, however, the BHA is keeping all options open for now. Two hundred of its 260 employees have now stopped work and salaries have been cut across the board, but the 60 staff still at work are focused on how an industry that supports tens of thousands of livelihoods will eventually stir back into life.\n\u201cWe are already anticipating that the initial return to racing is likely to be phased and almost certainly behind closed doors,\u201d Dunshea says. \u201cThis reflects the likelihood that any easing of the Covid-19 situation, and any associated restrictions and pressures on medical services, will also happen progressively.\n\u201cWith that in mind, we also expect any return to racing to begin, at least initially, with Flat racing, principally for reasons of safety and to minimise demands on emergency services.\u201d\nDunshea adds that while some \u201cJumpers Bumpers\u201d cards may be added to the schedule at some stage, jumps trainers should \u201cjudge whether horses can/should be turned out or kept in training\u201d.\nThe immediate suspension of racing earlier this month left freelancers \u201cincluding almost all jockeys and their valets\u201d without an income overnight, and while last week\u2019s announcement of government support for self-employed workers was welcomed by Paul Struthers, the chief executive of the Professional Jockeys\u2019 Association, he also warned of an \u201cacute, short-term need\u201d until payments arrive in June.\nTrainers, too, will know that owners and horses will begin to drift away if racecourses remain idle for weeks on end. There are no sales for breeders to sell horses, and no one would be buying in any case.\nWithout racing, the sport\u2019s economy begins to seize up, as prize money stops circulating around the system. In terms of revenue from the betting Levy alone, every month without racing costs the sport between \u00a36m and \u00a37m. Unfolding events and government advice will ultimately determine whether 1 May is a realistic date for racing to return in some form, but Dunshea and his team at the BHA can only attempt to ensure that the sport has a plan in place if it is needed. If or when it becomes certain that 1 May is impossible, the date will move, but the essentials of the planning for an eventual resumption will be the same.\nFor trainers and jockeys, it cannot come soon enough. But the immense nature of the task facing the BHA\u2019s planners should not be underestimated. Even if government guidelines are sufficiently relaxed by June to allow racing behind closed doors, it would be all but impossible to guarantee that no more than 500 people would attend a Derby at Epsom, where most of the annual crowd of 100,000 do not pay for admission in the first place. Royal Ascot, meanwhile, could well need more than 500 people on the ground to function at all, and it is, in any case, a social event as much as a race meeting. If the Queen and the procession are missing, is it really Royal Ascot at all?\nAbove all, planners will need to decide what to sacrifice and what to squeeze in over what remains of the Flat season, always knowing that someone, somewhere \u2013 trainers and owners included - will disagree with every decision. Could the Derby replace the Leger at Doncaster in September? How to allocate fixtures when some courses might go to the wall without racing? There are thousands of questions and the best answers could change with events from one day to the next.\nA return on 1 May could well be unrealistic, but over 250 years, horse racing has grown to become an immensely complicated network of inter-dependent professions, businesses and individuals. At a moment of national crisis, all are in as much need as everyone else of some reassurance of better times ahead.",

Social care workers will start being tested for coronavirus along with NHS staff from next week.\n\u201cThe personal protective equipment issued for staff is laughable,\u201d Steedman said. \u201cThese masks, as well as having an expiry date of 2016, are the sort of flimsy, paper thing that dentists wear with gaps all round the edges. The instructions say they should be used if a resident has symptoms of the virus or actually has it. But these masks are completely useless in those situations.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cThe government needs to take a reality check if they genuinely think otherwise. The hospitals are desperately trying to empty beds so they can take new people in, who have the virus, but we can\u2019t help them because they don\u2019t have the equipment to test those they\u2019re discharging.\u201d\nNHS trusts have been trying to discharge patients to free up capacity. Testing for the virus is not a requirement under discharge guidance issued by the government last week.\n\u201cI\u2019d be mad to let anyone into my home without a test showing they\u2019re free of the virus,\u201d Steedman said. \u201cIt\u2019s my responsibility to keep safe the hugely vulnerable residents who are in my care already. It would be dangerous foolishness on my part to accept any hospital discharges who might bring the virus into our home.\u201d\nPeter Kyle, the Labour MP for Hove, said Steedman and other care home managers he knew of who were also refusing to accept NHS discharges should be praised for their stance. \u201cCare homes simply can\u2019t afford to let anyone in unless they\u2019re confirmed not to be carrying the virus. The consequences of doing otherwise are just too awful to consider,\u201d he said.\n\u201cCare homes are going into crisis mode because the second there\u2019s a symptom of the virus in the home, there are layers upon layers of failure from the state to support them. The state is failing to test residents or staff quickly enough and they\u2019re failing to issue suitable equipment.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cThe failures are particularly shameful because not only are these people who have spent their lives paying into the system and deserve dignity, but the equipment is simple and straightforward and the state should be able to supply it.\u201d\nA senior director at a London acute trust, who asked not to be named, told the Health Service Journal: \u201cThere\u2019s a real problem with private care homes refusing to take patients back unless they\u2019ve been tested for Covid-19. But [testing] is not the national guidance currently and there just aren\u2019t enough testing kits to do it.\n\u201cI\u2019m now on calls with commissioners about getting more people out of hospital and into the community, and they\u2019re saying: \u2018Yes, that\u2019ll be done in the next week,\u2019 and I\u2019m on the verge of screaming at them.\u201d\nAnother acute sector director in north-west England said: \u201cWe need care homes to be really robust. We\u2019ve been hearing from colleagues that nursing homes won\u2019t accept their residents back after they\u2019ve been discharged from hospital, unless they\u2019ve been fully swabbed for coronavirus. This is not the national guidance, and we aren\u2019t able to do that right now. This could cause a huge issue.\u201d\nOn Saturday the health secretary, Matt Hancock, wrote an open letter of thanks to social care workers. Hancock, who is in isolation after testing positive for Covid-19, said the government was committed to doing \u201cwhatever is needed\u201d for social care and the NHS, including allowing workers from both sectors free parking in council-owned spaces.\n\u201cWhilst many people are now staying at home, I know that is not an option for most of you as your work caring for others cannot be done from home,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe will do all we can to make your lives easier during this period, including, for example, making parking on council-owned on-street spaces and car parks free for those who work in social care.\n\u201cWe are committed to doing whatever is needed; that promise applies just as much to social care as it does for the NHS.\u201d",

The main points were:\nOutdoor gatherings should now be restricted to a maximum of two people\nNo one should leave their house except for essential shopping, exercise, medical appointments or work, if they cannot work from home\nAll over-70s are \u201cstrongly advised\u201d to stay at home at all times, as well as over-60s with chronic illnesses and Indigenous people over 50\nThere will be a six-month moratorium on evictions from rental properties, with details to be worked out by the states and territories\nPublic areas such as playgrounds, outside gyms and skateparks will be closed from Monday.\nTwo more Australians have died of Covid-19. A Melbourne man in his 80s died in hospital, bringing the number of deaths in Victoria to four. A 75-year-old woman died at Caboolture hospital, after returning to Queensland from the Ruby Princess cruise ship. And New Zealand recorded its first death.\nMore than 350 cases were added to the national count on Sunday, but Scott Morrison said the daily rate of increase had declined from 25%-30% a week ago to as low as 9% on Sunday. The health minister, Greg Hunt, went as far as to say there were \u201cearly signs of flattening of the curve\u201d and the chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, suggested there was \u201cevidence that the public health measures that we are putting in place and the social distancing measures are likely to be having some early effect\u201d. But all cautioned that it was too soon to be certain of a solid trend.\nThe government\u2019s forthcoming wage guarantee will include people who have already lost their jobs as a result of the coronavirus outbreak, it was announced on Sunday morning, but Morrison gave no details on how it would work, other than that it would be in addition to measures already announced.\nAbout 1,600 Australians returning from overseas were the first to go into isolation in hotels for 14 days, after being processed by border force officers and seen by health officials. Early indications were that procedures at airports had been significantly tightened and streamlined since the chaotic scenes in Sydney last week.\nThere have now been 215 cases of coronavirus nationally from passengers on the Ruby Princess, of which 189 are in NSW. The latest figures also show 59 confirmed cases in NSW from the Ovation of the Seas, and 23 cases from the second cruise of the Voyager of the Seas.\nMore than 200 Australian cruise passengers from the Costa Luminosa and Costa Victoria were told they would be able to board a flight from Rome to Perth on Sunday evening. But any passengers who tested positive for Covid-19 would not be allowed to board, and it was unclear what would happen to them.\nScott Morrison announced the release of a new Covid-19 messaging service on WhatsApp and an Apple iPhone app to disseminate public health advice and allow people self-isolating to register their status. The app had been downloaded almost half a million times by Sunday evening, the prime minister said.\nThe federal government announced expanded funding for telehealth, domestic violence support and mental health services, as well as for boosting emergency relief delivered through charities and community organisations. The package includes:\n$669m for telehealth so people can get support from GPs and health advice from home\n$74m for mental health support\n$150m for domestic violence services, including 1800 RESPECT and Mensline\n$200m for emergency relief support including Foodbank, Salvation Army, St Vincent de Paul, Anglicare and other charities\n This article was amended on 30 March to clarify that all over-70s are strongly advised to stay at home at all times. A previous version stated \u201cindoors\u201d instead of \u201cat home\u201d.",

        "content": "Concerns health services could buckle and, in some countries, democracy could be further undermined\nOn the face of it, the map of Europe\u2019s struggle with coronavirus suggests the prospects for the eastern half of the continent are much less grim than for the western half.\nThe combined death toll to date across more than a dozen countries is less than the number of fatalities on any given recent day in Italy. The highest numbers of infections are in the Czech Republic and Poland, with 2,541 cases and 1,638 cases respectively, still a fraction of the numbers in most western European countries.\nPartly this could be down to lockdown measures introduced at an early stage in the outbreak. The Czech Republic imposed a strict lockdown two weeks ago, while at the same time Poland cancelled almost all flights in and out of the country. Polish authorities were also quick to close bars, restaurants, cinemas and schools. Police vehicles with mounted loudspeakers blare recorded messages urging people to stay at home.\nBut there is also a worry that the figures in some countries are deflated by a much lower testing rate than in western Europe. Hungary, for example, has conducted less than a quarter of the number of tests that neighbouring Austria has, despite having a slightly larger population. Britain, where lack of testing is also a serious concern, has conducted many more tests per capita than most countries in eastern Europe, with a few exceptions, notably the Czech Republic which has tested widely.\n\u201cOf course, the low number of confirmed cases has to do with the low amount of testing. I have a colleague who has symptoms, he has stayed at home for the past five days and he hasn\u2019t been tested yet,\u201d said one doctor at a Budapest hospital who asked to speak anonymously.\nIf and when the expected surge in cases does come, there is a fear that struggling and underfunded health services across the region could buckle. While concerns over outdated facilities and a lack of protective equipment are certainly not unique to central and eastern Europe, they could be particularly acute here.\n\u201cWe still don\u2019t have enough protective equipment,\u201d said the doctor in Budapest. Although there had been only 343 confirmed cases in Hungary, she said there was already a shortage of equipment for doctors working with coronavirus patients.\nRegulations have recently changed in her hospital, she said, meaning that only those doctors spending an hour or more with coronavirus patients are eligible to wear FFP2 masks offering high levels of protection. Those who spend less than an hour with patients receive only a simple surgical mask.\nSimilar issues have been raised across the region, especially outside capital cities.\n\u201cHelp us, we don\u2019t have gloves, masks, overalls, disinfectant or the money to pay for them,\u201d Barbara G\u0105siorowska, the director of a hospital in a small town south of Warsaw, pleaded in a Facebook post last week.\nIn one disastrous case in Suceava, Romania, the city\u2019s hospital was closed after nearly 100 medical staff contracted the virus. Romania is particularly vulnerable to a health crisis: the country has faced a chronic shortage of doctors for years, with thousands leaving for better paid jobs abroad.\nTo help with shortages of equipment, governments across the region have turned to Beijing. Over the past week the Czech and Hungarian prime ministers have personally met planes carrying equipment from China on the airport tarmac in Prague and Budapest.\nOn Thursday a plane containing 150 respirators, 600,000 medical masks and more than 250,000 medical overalls arrived in Warsaw. On Friday the Bulgarian prime minister, Boyko Borisov, announced he had struck a deal with China to purchase 50 respirators and 1.1m masks.\nThere have also been promises to scale up testing, with Serbia\u2019s president, Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107, pledging the country will move to a model of mass testing on the advice of Chinese medical experts. But increasing the number of tests requires laboratory capacity that may not be present.\n\u201cEven if we had more tests, we don\u2019t have the people to do them,\u201d Gra\u017cyna Cholewi\u0144ska, a Polish consultant specialising in infectious diseases, told the Polska Times this month. Romania\u2019s health minister resigned on Friday, two days after making the implausible promise that the government would test the entire 2 million population of Bucharest. So far Romania has carried out 12,000 tests.\nAuthorities have tried to silence medics who raise concerns in public. In Poland, a nurse was dismissed by the director of her hospital for publishing an angry account on Facebook in which she described a chronic shortage of essential equipment and other irregularities.\nIn Bulgaria, four doctors who complained about a lack of resources were reprimanded by the police for speaking out and \u201cspreading panic\u201d. In Hungary, several doctors contacted by the Guardian said they had been warned by their hospital bosses in the strictest terms against speaking to the media.\nThere is also a fear that emergency coronavirus measures across the region could lead to the further erosion of democratic norms in the long term. Legislation due to be passed in Hungary on Monday will give the far-right prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, the potential to rule by decree with no time limit or sunset clause. It also introduces jail terms for people who spread false information, and there are fears the law could be used to stifle critical reporting of the government response to the crisis.\nIn Bulgaria, the leader of the opposition Socialist party, Kornelia Ninova, lamented the suspension of parliament during the state of emergency as \u201cthe first step towards dictatorship\u201d.\nIn Poland, the government has insisted it will go ahead with presidential elections on 10 May despite the pandemic. In the early hours of Saturday morning, the Polish parliament passed an amendment to the electoral code allowing senior citizens and anyone in quarantine to use postal voting. The opposition has called for a postponement, saying it will be impossible to campaign during a pandemic.\nAmid the political manoeuvring, the region is nervously awaiting the inevitable rise in cases and hoping the early lockdowns will help avoid Italian-style carnage. One positive is that like elsewhere, people have come together like never before to support beleaguered medics.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never received this many messages of warmth and gratitude and this amount of love throughout my career,\u201d said the doctor in Budapest, who has been working for several decades. \u201cI feel like this time our work is really appreciated.\u201d\nAdditional reporting by Flora Garamvolgyi and Martin Dimitrov\n This article was amended on 31 March 2020, to add information about the Czech Republic testing widely for coronavirus.",

        "content": "Group video platforms are making a heroic rise from last resort to daily routine as people stay indoors. We tried five of the most popular ones out there\nFor those of us lucky enough to be home safe and healthy during the coronavirus pandemic, group video platforms are making a heroic rise from last resort to daily routine. For me, they\u2019ve actually resulted in a busier social life than pre-coronavirus days.\nAs I made it through week three of the #StayHome life, I tried five of the most popular. Here\u2019s my ranking, from worst to best.\nWhat is it? A group video and games app that allows eight people.\nPrice: Free, extra for more games.\nThe experience: I tried this out with a couple of friends I have kept in touch with for five years across the various continents we\u2019ve lived on. Colorful and splashy, it includes trivia, a drawing game, a billiards game and something called Mars Dash. It\u2019s possible we\u2019re all getting bleary-eyed and dull in our self-isolation, but my normally intelligent friends found the trivia, notably the obscure questions about the Cincinnati Reds, to be exceptionally difficult. The billiards game, meanwhile, is awkward to play and almost as boring as the real thing.\nThe app has a lot of bells and whistles \u2013 when you win a game, it sticks a crown on your head. But having to download some of the games the first time you play slows you down, and in these trying times, who has that kind of energy? In the end, the three of us just used it as a normal video chat and had a much better time.\nWorth it? Perhaps when you\u2019ve exhausted the other options.\nRating: 2/5\nWhat is it? A mobile app native to iPhones, iPads and Mac desktops. Allows up to 32 people.\nPrice: Free (as long as you\u2019re on the Apple train).\nThe experience: I was today years old when I learned you can FaceTime with 32 people, and honestly, I\u2019m shocked. I have never been able to successfully FaceTime with more than three or four people, and I find it to be a perennial letdown. In fact, I sustained a long-distance relationship for one and a half years with my now husband on FaceTime, and it was probably the thing we fought about the most (try looking at the words \u201cpoor connection\u201d and not making them a metaphor).\nFaceTime is handy because it comes pre-installed if you have an iPhone, and you can use it internationally over a data connection, like WhatsApp. But I still think it\u2019s best when there are only two people on the call.\nWorth it? If you\u2019re an Apple person, yes. If not, don\u2019t buy an iPhone for this feature.\nRating: 3/5\nWhat is it? A video platform that allows 25 people and can be accessed through an app, Gmail or other Google accounts.\nPrice: Free.\nThe experience: I have spent a lot of my life on Google Hangouts, probably because it\u2019s easy to access through Gmail, and I have my email open pretty much all the time. I\u2019ve used it in the quarantine era to workshop short stories with my fiction writing group and it wasn\u2019t all smooth sailing \u2013 connectivity issues seem to be the norm, and you\u2019re almost always looking at one big face, rather than a grid, which doesn\u2019t make it easy if you\u2019re doing more collaborative activities.\nMy pro tip for Google Hangouts is: open it in a pop-out window (there\u2019s a button to do so) rather than viewing it inside your inbox, so you\u2019re not checking email while spending quality time with your loved ones, which I swear I didn\u2019t do.\nWorth it? Why not? It\u2019s free and you probably already have it!\nRating: 3/5\nWhat is it? According to my college-going brother-in-law, this video app with integrated games used to be cool, stopped being cool, and then became cool in the last few weeks again. It allows up to eight people.\nPrice: Free, extra for more games.\nThe experience: I first tried Houseparty when my family used it to celebrate a birthday. It\u2019s fairly easy to use after everyone signs up, though we found the interface a bit difficult to navigate at first, which meant we accidentally left \u201cparties\u201d and missed several rounds of a game. But once we got the hang of it we had a pretty chill time playing  Heads Up! (which is like Apples to Apples), trivia, Quick Draw (akin to Pictionary) and Chips and Guac (sort of like Cards Against Humanity).\nThis app, however, is definitely geared towards millennials and Gen-Z. For example, references to Lil Uzi Vert and the term \u201cdank\u201d were lost on some of our older players, and there are definitely some not-kid-friendly cards. At one point my eight-year-old niece was challenged to complete a song lyric. The right answer was Hennessy, which she chose. Good for her, but as far as alcoholic brand awareness goes, not ideal!\nWorth it? Yes, but treat it like an actual house party (the beer pong kind) because it\u2019s not for everyone.\nRating: 4/5\nWhat is it? Often used in business settings, Zoom allows up to 100 people on a call, and up to 500 if you pay for the expanded version.\nPrice: Free for one-on-one calls or up to 40 minutes with more than two people, then paid.\nThe experience: I never thought I would be excited to join a Zoom meeting, but this has become the go-to for many of my friends\u2019 post-work hangouts. The ease with which many people can join is nice, and you can choose fun backgrounds and effects to take the vibe from work to play (like when you take off your blazer and put on a daring necklace for after-work drinks). Zoom also offers various layouts for how you see other people in the chat, so you can do a Brady Bunch tiled setup and avoid staring at yourself the whole time.\nI\u2019ve had the fewest connectivity issues on Zoom. But the time limit is annoying, so to use it longer you\u2019ll need to find a friend who has access to the paid plan.\nWorth it? It\u2019s your best bet for a seamless group video chat and can accommodate large families like mine and wayward friends.\nRating: 4.5/5. I\u2019m docking half a point because it should be free and unlimited right now.",

        "content": "While Washington appears to have come to a grinding halt, more than 2 million federal workers across the US continue to provide vital services\nWhite House tours have been canceled; Capitol Hill hallways are mostly empty; the Smithsonian museums have been closed. Washington DC, like much of the rest of the country, appears to have come to a grinding halt as America grapples with the coronavirus crisis.\nBut government goes on. More than 2 million federal employees spread out across America are continuing to provide vital services to keep the country running amid the crisis, often putting themselves in harm\u2019s way to do so and dealing with previous decisions by the Trump administration that are hampering the effort.\nThe Trump administration has told federal agencies to postpone \u201cnon-mission-critical functions\u201d to mitigate the spread of the virus, but a significant percentage of government employees are still reporting to their place of work while public health experts urge Americans to stay home.\n\u201cThere are hundreds of thousands of federal workers that are still going to work today, and they have the same kind of concerns as any other worker in other sectors of the economy,\u201d said Randy Erwin, the national president of the National Federation of Federal Employees, a union representing government workers.\nMany of those government employees still reporting to their posts are unable to shift to working from home due to lack of equipment or the nature of their jobs.\nFor example, the Department of Defense, which reported its first coronavirus-related death on Sunday, employs many workers who retrofit critical military equipment like tanks. Hundreds of thousands of healthcare professionals working for the Department of Veterans Affairs will also need to continue caring for veterans as they contract coronavirus.\nA number of those federal workers have expressed concerns about their safety, as many workplaces go without personal protective equipment to limit their risk of becoming sick. \u201cYou\u2019d be shocked at how ill-prepared a lot of federal agencies are with even the basics,\u201d Erwin said. He described one work site that didn\u2019t have soap in the bathrooms, even though public health experts are recommending frequent hand-washing to mitigate the spread of the virus.\nFor the hundreds of thousands of federal workers who have desk jobs, the shift to telework amid the pandemic has not always been seamless. The Trump administration has tried to limit telework at multiple government agencies, after the Obama administration made efforts to expand remote working opportunities. The policy shift appears to have left the government without much of a broad strategy for how to keep federal employees working while they cannot safely go to their offices.\nSome employees lack government-issued laptops, and concerns have been raised about the virtual private networks (VPNs) employees use to connect to government networks while working remotely. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency at the Department of Homeland Security warned in a memo earlier this month that the VPNs expose more technical \u201cvulnerabilities\u201d, which can be \u201cfound and targeted by malicious cyber actors\u201d.\nThe agency also noted the \u201climited number of VPN connections\u201d could prevent some employees from working remotely, urging senior officials to update and test VPNs to prepare for mass usage.\n\u201cI think it is obvious from the lack of equipment that our federal government was caught completely with its pants down,\u201d Erwin said. \u201cIt\u2019s not as easy as flipping a switch and shifting to telework.\u201d\nMoe Vela, who served as the director of administration and management to former vice-president Joe Biden, said the Trump administration had missed opportunities in the months and years leading up to the coronavirus pandemic to prepare for such a crisis.\n\u201cOur government was severely delayed in many ways in their response to the pandemic,\u201d Vela, now chief transparency officer of TransparentBusiness, said. The former White House official noted the government \u201ctends to operate somewhat like a dinosaur\u201d, so federal agencies are often slow to implement beneficial changes to long-standing systems, which may have cost the Trump administration some critical time in responding to the pandemic.\n\u201cHowever, I do not think it\u2019s irreparable, and it can be addressed,\u201d Vela added. He argued the government needs to move quickly to implement a robust teleworking policy that would allow more employees to avoid public transportation and offices, limiting the spread of the virus.\nAs the country\u2019s largest employer, the federal government could be setting an example on how to responsibly continue operations amid the pandemic, Erwin said. \u201cThe federal government should be a leader in these things, and telework is one of the primary ways that you can still get business done while respecting the guidance on social distancing,\u201d the union president said.\nBut Donald Trump appears eager to resume normal operations, saying on Tuesday that he wants the country \u201copened up and just raring to go by Easter\u201d. The comments raised concerns that federal employees who have been able to work remotely will be forced to return to their offices while the pandemic is still raging.\n\u201cIf in the near term they make a shift to bring people back to work, I can promise you federal employees will be extremely concerned for their safety,\u201d Erwin said. \u201cAnd I can promise you that as the union representing them, we will fight that with every fiber of our being.\u201d\nHaving served on the White House emergency preparedness council, Vela urged the president to defer to public health experts, who have warned the country may need to adhere to social distancing practices for at least several more weeks. \u201cPlease stop prescribing. Just facilitate and coordinate,\u201d Vela said of Trump\u2019s approach to the crisis. \u201cThat\u2019s what the role of the federal government is, to keep our citizens safe, and you\u2019re not keeping people safe when you don\u2019t listen to the experts.\u201d",

        "content": "Fear of being denied a green card or visa is causing many to fear using public medical services, putting them at risk for Covid-19\nAs the coronavirus spread through California and the economic fallout of the pandemic began to hit Patricia\u2019s community in the rural Coachella Valley, she said a new Trump administration policy had layered worries upon her worries.\nThe so-called \u201cpublic charge\u201d rule, which allows the government to deny green cards and visas to immigrants who rely on public benefits, went into effect in late February, just as the first cases of Covid-19 were being reported across the US.\n\u201cNow, we are in panic,\u201d said Patricia, a 46-year-old mother of three and daughter of two elderly parents. The Guardian is not using Patricia\u2019s real name to protect her and her undocumented family members.\nPatricia\u2019s father, who stopped seeking treatment for his pancreatic cancer after a lawyer advised that using some public medical benefits could affect his bid to gain legal status, is among the most at-risk for complications from contracting the coronavirus. So is her mother, who is diabetic.\n\u201cI have a broken heart,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been told that if we want papers to feel secure and calm here, there\u2019s a tradeoff.\u201d\nAlthough the US Citizenship and Immigration Services last week announced under pressure from lawmakers and advocacy groups that immigrants who undergo testing or treatment for Covid-19 would not be denied visas or green cards under the new rule, fear and confusion are stopping people from seeking medical care. In the midst of a pandemic, health and legal experts say that policies designed to exclude vulnerable immigrant communities from medical care are fueling a public health disaster.\n\u201cThe community doesn\u2019t trust the government right now.\u201d said Luz Gallegos, who directs the Todec Legal Center in southern California. As Covid-19 spreads across the state, much of the center\u2019s efforts recently have been dedicated to reassuring immigrants that they can and should take advantage of health programs if they can.\nPatricia, who went to Todec for advice, said even though she\u2019s been told that the public charge rule doesn\u2019t apply to those who want to get tested for the coronavirus, she can\u2019t help but worry. \u201cWith this president, you can never know,\u201d she said. When immigration policies can change overnight, she said, \u201chow can we have trust?\u201d\nEven before the public charge rules went into effect, a UCLA analysis found that more than 2 million Californians enrolled in the state\u2019s public food and medical benefits programs could be affected by the rule, which allows immigration officials to turn away those seeking green cards and visas based on who are \u201clikely to be a public charge\u201d.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t stop the spread of disease while denying health coverage to people,\u201d said Ninez Ponce, director of the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research. \u201cIt\u2019s irresponsible public health policy.\u201d\nAlthough several groups of immigrants, including asylum-seekers and refugees, are exempt from the rule, the complicated, 217-page regulation has a \u201cchilling effect\u201d, Ponce said, driving people to withdraw from social services even if they don\u2019t have to.\nOn Sunday, local health officials announced a sixth death due to the virus in Riverside county, where Todec is based. \u201cIt feels like people are between walls,\u201d Gallegos said. \u201cThey\u2019re afraid of the outbreak, and they\u2019re afraid of getting help. There\u2019s a lot of trauma in the community.\u201d\nFor Benyamin Chao, who grappled with the public charge regulations before recently gaining a green card, his new legal status hasn\u2019t given him much relief. His mother and younger brother are still undocumented.\n\u201cWe\u2019re experiencing the pandemic like everyone else, but the thing is, there\u2019s all these additional barriers to where we can get help,\u201d said Chao, 24, who works as a campaign coordinator at the California Immigrant Policy Center. He\u2019s been helping friends and family \u2013 some of whom have been unable to work in bars and restaurants, or as domestic workers or caregivers \u2013 navigate the complex public benefit rules, reminding them that community health clinics and state health programs that aren\u2019t funded by the federal government are safe to use.\nThe economic fallout from the pandemic could leave many immigrants in need of public assistance now, more than ever, Chao noted. But he understands why many immigrants are avoiding seeking medical care altogether. \u201cWhen I filed to adjust my status, my spouse and I disenrolled from CalFresh,\u201d said Chao, referring to a program that provides food assistance for low-income Californians.\nEven though it was his partner, not him, who had signed up for the program, and even though he knew that taking advantage of that assistance wouldn\u2019t necessarily disqualify his application for a work permit, \u201cI just went with what gave me peace of mind,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd at that point I had probably internalized what I\u2019d heard from the president, about what kind of immigrant I\u2019d be if I was burdening the government.\u201d\nMariana Garcia said she and her family were similarly shaken by the administration\u2019s recent policies. The 25-year-old, who is authorized to live and work in the US through the Obama-era Daca program, has health insurance \u2013 for now. But she worries about her father, who still suffers from health complications after being stabbed in the stomach years ago, who has refused to see the doctor recently. \u201cHe\u2019s so afraid of seeking medical care for the virus, or for anything else,\u201d she said, tearing up. \u201cI\u2019m afraid my parents will fall sick.\u201d\nIn an open letter to Mike Pence and other leaders, nearly 800 public health and legal experts urged officials to make healthcare facilities immigration enforcement-free zones. In a separate letter, 17 attorneys general \u2013 including from California, New York and Washington state \u2014 implored the Trump administration to fully suspend the public charge rule, so people feel comfortable seeking medicare for any and all health issues during the crisis.\n\u201cHealthcare is not just about addressing an emergency situation,\u201d said Ponce of UCLA. Immigrants who aren\u2019t able to get treatment for underlying health issues before they become serious are not only more likely to die from Covid-19, they\u2019re also more likely to end up in already overwhelmed emergency rooms and intensive care departments. \u201cWe want to do everything we can to help people stave off and fight infections,\u201d Ponce said. \u201cAnd that includes preventative healthcare.\u201d\nIn California, where a quarter of the population is foreign-born, and more than half its citizens has an immigrant parent, leaving even a small segment of immigrant families unable or afraid to seek medical care could undermine statewide efforts to contain coronavirus, Ponce added.\nThe coronavirus pandemic is \u201cExhibit A for why the public charge rule is stupid\u201d said Almas Sayeed, at the California Immigrant Policy Center. Because many of the immigrants eligible for safety-net public health programs work low-wage jobs, the coronavirus crisis has left them needing food assistance and medical benefits now more than ever.\n\u201cIn many of these hourly jobs, there\u2019s no paid sick time off, there\u2019s no paid family leave,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely insane to keep them from using benefits.\u201d\nNow more than ever, the policy feels insulting, said Garcia, a farmworker. \u201cWe are the people that provide produce for your home,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are doing some of the hardest jobs in the world.\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t consider ourselves a public burden,\u201d added Patricia. \u201cWe are human beings.\u201d",

That doesn\u2019t make me noble or brave or anything like that, I just think there are lots of grandparents out there in this country like me.\u201d\nThe extreme rightwing media figure Glenn Beck shared the sentiment.\n\u201cI would rather have my children stay home and all of us who are over 50 go in and keep this economy going and working, even if we all get sick, I would rather die than kill the country. \u2019Cause it\u2019s not the economy that\u2019s dying, it\u2019s the country,\u201d Beck said on an episode of his program on Blaze TV.\nThe Republican Wisconsin senator Ron Johnson also questioned whether the economic impact of physical distancing was worth it, appearing to rate the coronavirus threat as less than fatal car accidents.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t shut down our economy because tens of thousands of people die on the highways. It\u2019s a risk we accept so we can move about. We don\u2019t shut down our economies because tens of thousands of people die from the common flu.\u201d\nJohnson also said \u201cgetting coronavirus is not a death sentence except for maybe no more than 3.4% of our population, [and] I think probably far less\u201d.\nThe rightwing Federalist magazine has also run stories urging Trump to get the economy going again and attacked Democrats \u2013 not the US president \u2013 for their reactions to the crisis. One article peddled the idea that \u201ca handful of Democratic activists created alarming, but bogus data sets to scare local and state officials into making rash, economy-killing mandates\u201d.\nElsewhere business lobbying groups are also lobbying against economic shutdowns. The Tampa Bay Times reported that the Florida chamber of commerce has lobbied the Republican state governor, urging him not to take drastic measures that might shut down the state\u2019s economy.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the data says we need to do a statewide shutdown,\u201d Mark Wilson, the chamber\u2019s CEO, told the paper.\nIt is true that conservatives are not alone in their desire to stimulate the languishing economy.\nNew York\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, a longtime Trump foe, echoed the White House\u2019s desire to relaunch business.\n\u201cI take total responsibility for shutting off the economy in terms of essential workers but we also have to start to plan the pivot back to economic functionality,\u201d he told journalists in the state capital, Albany. \u201cYou can\u2019t stop the economy forever.\u201d\nBut, Cuomo said on Tuesday that economic rebound should not be accompanied by death.\n\u201cIf you ask the American people to choose between public health and the economy, then it\u2019s no contest,\u201d he said. \u201cNo American is going to say, accelerate the economy at the cost of human life, because no American is going to say how much a life is worth.\u201d",

        "content": "Unions and the ACT chief minister had criticised the government for stalling, while telling private business employees to work from home\nThe federal government has issued new guidance to federal departments and agencies to move as many of its 160,000 employees to working from home as possible, as the Covid-19 pandemic continues to spread.\nDespite the exhortations to other employers to get their employees to work from home, until Sunday there was no clear policy about who in the federal public service should work from home, causing consternation from the union that covers public servants.\n\u201cThe prime minister and the APSC must follow their own advice and allow the public sector to work from home, wherever possible. It is just baffling that there is one rule for private business and another for the public sector,\u201d the CPSU national secretary, Melissa Donnelly, said earlier on Sunday.\nOn Sunday evening the commonwealth public service commissioner, Peter Woolcott, released new advice making it clear that federal public servants should work from home where possible.\nWoolcott said the updated guidance made it clear that, wherever practicable, public servants should work from home, subject to the decisions of agency heads.\nHe said it was up to departmental and agency heads, but working from home was \u201cthe priority\u201d.\nWoolcott also stressed that every public servant who can work, should work.\n\u201cThe government considers the APS to be an essential service which needs to keep working in order to keep Australians safe, and ensure that services are delivered for the Australian people,\u201d he said.\n\u201cAgency heads have always had the flexibility for employees to work at home subject to operational requirements. But current circumstances mean as soon as practicable agency heads should facilitate their staff working from home where possible,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThese are extraordinary times. A time where the Australian Public Service is essential to keep Australians safe, and to deliver services for the Australian people. Our focus is on both employees\u2019 health and wellbeing, and importantly the continued delivery of critical public services.\u201d\nHe said APS staff would be deployed to where needs were greatest and that agency heads would be asked to facilitate movement of staff between agencies urgently to perform critical functions.\nThe CPSU said the Australian Taxation office had been on the verge of moving the majority of its staff to remote working last week, but had put the plan on hold after \u201cmixed messages\u201d from the prime minister, including that \u201canyone with a job is an essential service\u201d.\nDefence and the ATO are understood to have run large-scale trials of remote working but have been waiting for an APSC-wide directive before implementing them.\nTensions had been simmering between the union and the government after departmental heads appeared reluctant to allow working from home without a government policy.\nOne message from the Department of Social Security to all staff last week said: \u201cThere has been no direction from Government for the APS, as an essential service, to move to a broader working from home stance.\u201d\nHowever, DSS said short-term home-based working arrangements were in place for people who may be more vulnerable and to assist meeting social distancing requirements.\nSome departments such as Treasury and Finance already have high levels of people working from home, but other policy departments were still requiring attendance at the office.\nThe ACT chief minister, Andrew Barr, had also expressed concern about the slow move to remote working. The ACT had 77 Covid-19 cases as of Sunday.\nAsked about the federal public service on ABC\u2019s Insiders program on Sunday, the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, said: \u201c If they can work from home, they should work from home.\n\u201cBut there is a lot of work that needs to be done right now by the federal public service to support the government\u2019s efforts in relation to protecting people\u2019s health.\u201d\nHe declined to elaborate on which public servants would be permitted to work from home.\n\u201cThis is going to be done through an orderly fashion based on the appropriate advice. I\u2019m not going to provide a directive through Insiders, as much as you would want me to do so,\u201d he said.\nThe new directive reveals the APSC has established an APS Workforce Management Taskforce to manage the mobility of the workforce across agencies.\nWoolcott said the taskforce was in the early stages of identifying the critical gaps in capacity across the public service. In the short term, the key priority is to increase capacity in areas that are critical to the delivery of government services.\nThe redeployment comes on top of recruitment of an extra 5,000 workers at Centrelink, which the CPSU believes will be filled by 4,500 private sector workers, including labour hire, and just 500 casuals recruited to the public service.",

It is all our #MeToo anxieties at once.\nAs knockabout comedies go, this one is uncommonly alarming. Indeed, Braunschweig, whose Measure for Measure toured the UK in 1997, gives the whole play a rare psychological depth. He pushes beyond the stock characters of impotent old man, innocent virgin and clean-cut hero to offer something more subtle.\nYes, Arnolphe remains a figure of fun. With his trim suit and bended knees, Duparfait plays him like a man comically uncomfortable in his own skin. Yet he also comes across as genuinely distressed by the unravelling of his plan. You almost feel sorry for him.\nAubert\u2019s Agn\u00e8s, meanwhile, is every bit the modern woman. Her response to Arnolphe\u2019s patriarchal opinions is to laugh uncontrollably. Who needs a big speech to reply to views so patently absurd? Inexperienced she might be, but she is a woman in charge of her own destiny.\n L\u2019Ecole des femmes is available to watch online with English subtitles at vimeo.com/327310297.",

The number of very generous donations from everyone doubled our target within three days.\u201d\nMcAvoy\u2019s donation was \u201cmindblowing\u201d, he said, and would mean an order for 75,000 masks and 75,000 visors can be placed immediately rather than having to wait for enough donations to filter through.\n\u201cThis is a global catastrophic event and an extremely tough time for governments across world, no different from ours. There is a worldwide shortage of PPE [that\u2019s] likely to go on for months,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government is doing all it can but the NHS needs all the help it can get. We are also competing with the commercial market who are trying to sell the same PPE for extraordinary prices.\u201d\nHe said the situation was urgent and that time was of the essence, noting that one of the doctors behind the crowdfunding campaign has tested positive for coronavirus. The campaign was working with the government, which had been inundated with offers of inadequate equipment at inflated prices from private companies.\n\u201cThat is why we raised the capital ourselves and hope to help government distribute these supplies in best possible way,\u201d he said.\nThe doctors say in their appeal: \u201cUnfortunately current hospital supplies are not sufficient and while we are reassured the government is doing everything it can, healthcare workers on the frontline are risking themselves daily without adequate protection to care for sick patients. Healthcare workers on the frontline without PPE is the equivalent of going to war without armour and protection.\u201d\nMcAvoy said on Instagram: \u201cMoney donated today will save lives \u2026 Help us to help the government to help the NHS.\u201d\nThe Guardian revealed on Friday that the Department of Health had rejected high-level medical advice about providing NHS staff with certain protective equipment during an influenza pandemic because stockpiling it would be too expensive.\nDocuments show that officials working under the then health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, told medical advisers three years ago to reconsider a formal recommendation that eye protection should be provided to all healthcare professionals who have close contact with pandemic flu patients.",

        "content": "Arguably the greatest upset in World Cup history and one that made me well and truly fall in love with football\nLife is filled with memorable summers and among my first was that of 1990. I was nine at the time and for the past year or so a Liverpool supporter. But that was as far as my love of football went \u2013 they were the only team I cared about, the only team I wanted to watch, and games that did not involve men in red shirts with Candy across the middle didn\u2019t interest me much. That, however, was about to change.\nOn Friday 8 June 1990 to be precise, when I sat down in front of the living-room television to watch Argentina versus Cameroon in the opening fixture of the World Cup.\nDiego Maradona was key to my decision to do so. I had heard of him, how he was the best player of his generation and probably of all time, and here he was \u2013 on show at the start of a global tournament taking place across an entire month. I was intrigued by what lay ahead and there was to be no disappointment, thanks in large part not to Maradona but rather to the team with lions on their chests and stardust in their boots.\nCameroon\u2019s World Cup campaign was magnificent and no more so than on day one when in beating Argentina 1-0 at San Siro they pulled off arguably the greatest upset in World Cup history and one that put African football on the map. Before then teams from the continent had largely been dismissed and derided, with Zaire\u2019s farcical display at the 1974 tournament, particularly at free-kicks, doing much to shape opinions. Cameroon were not expected to change that given they arrived in Italy as a squad largely made up of journeymen from France\u2019s lower leagues who were in poor form and riven by division. There was no doubt \u2013 they were going to be blown away, and especially so by the reigning champions. But on a warm Milan evening, Cameroon torched the odds.\nIt was not a great game but it was a memorable one because of two moments: Fran\u00e7ois Omam-Biyik\u2019s goal on 67 minutes \u2013 a towering but weak header that somehow squirmed through the grasp of Nery Pumpido and ultimately decided the contest \u2013 and then, two minutes from time, Benjamin Massing\u2019s foul on Claudio Caniggia.\nCaniggia had evaded two Cameroon tackles as he went on a counterattacking surge but stood no chance of evading Massing\u2019s given it was less a tackle and more an assault, waist-high and so strong that it sent Massing\u2019s right boot flying in the air. The referee, Michel Vautrot, had no option but to dismiss Massing, having already sent off his teammate Andr\u00e9 Kana-Biyik for a far less heinous offence.\nMassing\u2019s foul on Caniggia is one of those things that lives with you and ever since it is what has come to mind whenever I\u2019ve thought about wildly brutal attacks. Roy Keane on Alf-Inge Haaland \u2013 Benjamin Massing. Ben Thatcher on Pedro Mendes \u2013 Benjamin Massing. The 2003 invasion of Iraq \u2013 Benjamin Massing.\nTo an extent it characterised Cameroon\u2019s approach to this game, yet it would be wrong to suggest Valeri Nepomniachi\u2019s men only beat Argentina because they kicked them off the pitch. Cameroon were rugged and uncompromising (so much so that they kept Maradona quiet throughout) but they also performed with skill and ambition. As David Lacey put it in the Guardian: \u201cThe better team won\u201d. That they did so with nine men only added to the scale of the achievement.\nCameroon would go on to reach the quarter-finals, where they were narrowly beaten by England, and returned home as heroes, no one more so than Roger Milla, their 38-year-old, snake-hipped striker who epitomised the wonder of that side. And for nine-year-old me what they did against Argentina was the hook. My imagination had been caught by the drama and spectacle of it all and now I wanted as much football as I could get. And that summer I got plenty; Matth\u00e4us\u2019s piledriver, O\u2019Leary\u2019s penalty, Schillaci\u2019s eyes \u2026 Gazza\u2019s tears. It was a feast.\nItalia 90 may have been a poor World Cup but it changed my life, personally as well as professionally. And it began with a quite glorious shock.",

The Foreign Investment Review Board will extend its review timeframes from 30 days to six months, as it works through the government\u2019s new measures.\nThe treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, said the government was not looking to stop international investment, but to monitor it. Urgent applications, designed to keep businesses open and jobs attached, would be given priority.\n\u201cThis temporary change will be achieved by reducing to $0 the monetary screening thresholds for all foreign investments under the act,\u201d Frydenberg said.\n\u201cBy temporarily reducing the foreign investment threshold, the Australian government will ensure appropriate oversight over all proposed foreign investment during this time.\u201d\nUnder the current systems, reviews kicked in at staggered thresholds, depending on the asset. For businesses classified as \u201cnon-sensitive\u201d, where free trade agreements are in place, that is as high as $1.192bn, while it may be as low as $275m for investors from non-free trade agreement partners for industries deemed more sensitive, such as agriculture.\nAs much of the western world locks down economies as the implications of the coronavirus pandemic grip harder, China has made moves towards restarting its own economic activity, raising concerns distressed foreign assets could be bought without appropriate checks and balances.\nFrydenberg said investment remained crucial to Australia\u2019s economy, even as it entered a period of suspended animation, but stressed the need to ensure it remained in the national interest.\n\u201cEven in these uncertain times, Australia continues to welcome foreign investment, which remains vital to our long-term economic success and stability. The government recognises that foreign investment will play an important part in helping many businesses get to the other side, securing jobs and supporting economic recovery,\u201d he said.\n\u201cHowever, these measures are necessary to safeguard the national interest as the coronavirus outbreak puts intense pressure on the Australian economy and businesses.\u201d\nFrydenberg said the new measures would remain in place for \u201cthe duration of the current crisis\u201d.\nThe government has previously said that any new measure it puts in place is considered active for at least six months.",

Tokyo has confirmed 68 new coronavirus cases, another record daily increase, as millions of people in and around Tokyo are urged to stay at home unless a trip outside is necessary. And the Swiss Covid-19 death toll has risen from 235 to 257 in a day, with the number of confirmed cases increasing to 14,336 from 13,213.\nThe British cabinet minister Michael Gove has said the lockdown restrictions in the UK could remain in place for a \u201csignificant period\u201d, as criticism mounted over the government\u2019s testing of cases and ordering of ventilators under an EU scheme they did not participate in because of \u201ccommunication problems\u201d.\nDomestic abuse victims are allowed to leave home to seek help despite the lockdown rules, the UK home secretary Priti Patel has said in a column in the Mail on Sunday.\nThe US infectious diseases authority, the CDC, has urged millions of residents in three states \u2013 New York, New Jersey and Connecticut \u2013 to avoid non-essential travel, citing extensive spread of coronavirus among the population.\nItaly\u2019s deputy health minister Pierpaolo Sileri has said he expects the country, which is globally the worst affected by Covid-19 and has now recorded more than 10,000 deaths, to hit its infection peak in no more than 10 days.\nAustralia\u2019s prime minister Scott Morrison has announced further restrictions for the population, including limiting public gatherings to just two people. People should only leave their homes for essential reasons, and those over the age of 70 should stay home, he said.\nAll travellers entering South Korea will be subjected to two weeks of mandatory quarantine starting midnight on Wednesday, prime minister Chung Sye-kyun announced on Sunday.\nDomestic flights will resume in Hubei province, except in Wuhan, from Sunday midnight local time.",

        "content": "Survey finds loss of benefits has made some doctors less willing to work in high-risk areas\nHundreds of doctors have said they are less likely to return to the frontline or increase their hours to fight Covid-19 because they fear their families will not be properly compensated if they die, the Guardian has learned.\nDoctors who are no longer eligible for full death-in-service benefits have complained to the health secretary, Matt Hancock, that their families will be left not only grieving but in financial difficulty if they succumb to the virus.\nDozens have said the concern has stopped them from shifting their hours and working patterns to help in the NHS battle against the outbreak.\nMore than 350 respondents to a survey by the Doctors\u2019 Association UK (DAUK), a grassroots medics group, said loss of death-in-service benefits made them less likely to work in high-risk areas, increase their hours or return to service.\nForty people responding to the survey indicated they had declined to change their hours and working patterns as a result of a lack of death-in-service benefit, which is typically worth more than two year\u2019s pay.\nTen days ago Hancock called on more than 65,000 former NHS nurses and doctors to consider returning to aid \u201ca huge national effort to protect lives and protect our NHS\u201d. Thousands responded positively. Last week he said 2,660 doctors were among almost 12,000 recently retired NHS staff who were returning.\nThe health secretary, who is isolating with \u201cmild\u201d symptoms of coronavirus, also announced a deal with the private sector to supply 700 additional doctors. But others are reluctant and say that if the death-in-service arrangements were changed they would feel more comfortable about coming back.\nSymptoms are defined by the NHS as either:\nNHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should\u00a0stay at home for at least 7 days.\nIf you live with other people,\u00a0they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.\nAfter 14 days, anyone you live with who does not have symptoms can return to their normal routine. But, if anyone in your home gets symptoms, they should stay at home for 7 days from the day their symptoms start.\u00a0Even if it means they're at home for longer than 14 days.\nIf you live with someone who is 70 or over, has a long-term condition, is pregnant or has a weakened immune system, try to find somewhere else for them to stay for 14 days.\nIf you have to stay at home together, try to keep away from each other as much as possible.\nAfter 7 days, if you no longer have a high temperature you can return to your normal routine.\nIf you still have a high temperature, stay at home until your temperature returns to normal.\nIf you still have a cough after 7 days, but your temperature is normal, you do not need to continue staying at home. A cough can last for several weeks after the infection has gone.\nStaying at home means you should:\nYou can use your garden, if you have one. You can also leave the house to exercise \u2013 but stay at least 2 metres away from other people.\nIf you have symptoms of coronavirus, use the\u00a0NHS 111 coronavirus service\u00a0to find out what to do.\nSource:\u00a0NHS England\u00a0on 23 March 2020\nThe British Medical Association (BMA) has also raised the issue, and it could affect serving doctors who have opted out of the NHS pension scheme.\nAt the weekend Adil El Tayar, 63, became the first known working NHS surgeon to succumb to coronavirus. He died on Wednesday at West Middlesex university hospital in London, his family said. He had been volunteering in A&E departments in the Midlands.\nThe BMA has said it is aware of a small number of UK doctors admitted to intensive care units requiring ventilation after contracting the virus. It was reported on Sunday that up to 50 doctors had died in Italy during the outbreak there.\nDr Samantha Batt-Rawden, an intensive care doctor who leads DAUK, said: \u201cIt is simply morally unforgivable that at this time where we ask them to put their lives on the line, those recently retired and returning to service, locum doctors and those forced out of the NHS pension scheme by a punitive tax are not eligible for death in service benefit.\u201d\nShe stressed that retired doctors, senior consultants and senior locum GPs who were being asked to join the fight against Covid-19 were in a higher-risk group because of their age.\n\u201cThese doctors feel a strong moral duty to do all they can to serve patients at this time of national crisis and deserve the same parity of esteem as their colleagues,\u201d Batt-Rawden said. \u201cWe therefore ask Matt Hancock to ensure that all doctors receive death-in-service benefit. This will allow doctors to continue fighting this pandemic without the added stress of worrying about leaving their families in financial difficulty should they die in the line of duty.\u201d\nLast week the Department of Health and Social Care said it was \u201cconsidering proposals to offer further support for those returning to the frontline\u201d. It has been contacted for further comment.\nSpeaking on condition of anonymity, a locum GP with three young children told the DAUK survey: \u201cIt is a very real worry and threat that healthcare workers could die as a direct result of working with positive Covid patients.\n\u201cWe are all here to help our patients but, weighing up everything, it would be devastating for me to die and on top of that my family be in financial difficulty. This will almost certainly mean I will do less face to face work/less hours altogether.\u201d\nAnother GP said they were booking in frontline shifts for only a week at a time. \u201cNo personal protective equipment plus no death in service plus lack of clear leadership/guidance here feels like freefall to me,\u201d they said.\nA locum GP with an 18-month-old child and no death-in-service benefit said they had decided to do only virtual consultations. \u201cPart of me is guilty that I\u2019m not putting myself out there, but I guess the realisation that she could be left with no mother and no financial security is just awful,\u201d she said.",

        "content": "With parliament in recess, the press has a vital role in holding the government to account\nWhere was the compassion? The overwhelming mainstream media response to the announcement that Boris Johnson had tested positive for Covid-19 was anything but sympathetic. It was summed up by a Daily Mail headline which pointedly asked whether Johnson, his ministers and advisers had not practised the social distancing they had preached.\nSimilarly, the Guardian referred to accusations that the prime minister had been guilty of nonchalance by failing to heed his own advice to the public. Amid the crisis, he may not be held to account. But the Sunday Mirror, reflecting the consensus viewpoint, argued that later \u201che will have serious questions to face\u201d.\nAltogether less serious was the Mail on Sunday\u2019s suggestion, on the thinnest of evidence, that the EU\u2019s Brexit negotiator, Michael Barnier, was the source of Johnson\u2019s infection. This nonsense had a Trumpist feel to it, a pathetic attempt to take the spotlight off the prime minister it slavishly supports.\nSymptoms are defined by the NHS as either:\nNHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should\u00a0stay at home for at least 7 days.\nIf you live with other people,\u00a0they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.\nAfter 14 days, anyone you live with who does not have symptoms can return to their normal routine.

These rapid changes of approach echoed the swiftness of the pandemic\u2019s grip on public imagination. Johnson\u2019s dilemma was met initially with a measure of understanding that soon elided into a large dose media credulity.\nDuring that honeymoon period, it was largely accepted that Johnson was acting correctly by following scientific advice advocating \u201cherd immunity.\u201d This was challenged by other scientists, such as William Hanage, but counter arguments got little media traction. When the government performed a U-turn in mid-March the BBC tamely accepted the false No 10 line that its strategy changed because the science had changed.\nMore than a week passed before the second phase saw natural journalistic scepticism kick in. Johnson found himself fielding pertinent questions. Did he really think \u201cherd immunity\u201d was either a practical or moral response? Sure, he was relying on the science, but were the scientists on which he was basing his policy right?\nWatching his press conferences, it was possible to sense a growing frustration among the questioning political editors. They were polite, as was he. He took care to name them \u2013 \u201cthank you, Laura\u201d \u2026 \u201cyes, Beth\u201d \u2026 \u201cwhere\u2019s Heather?\u201d \u2013 and, after repeating his central messages about handwashing and social distancing, he passed the trickier inquiries to his scientific wingmen.\nAs an exercise in transparency it just about held up, although it didn\u2019t really amount to public accountability because it was impossible for the journalists to be as fierce and forensic as MPs in the Commons during prime minister\u2019s questions. Nor were they able to ask supplementary questions. The problem of dealing with Johnsonian evasiveness became more apparent when the conferences were staged remotely.\nAt the beginning of last week came the third phase: overt hostility. It was unsurprising to find the anti-Tory Daily Mirror in the vanguard with its accusation that Johnson and his government \u201cwere criminally slow to respond to the threat\u201d and lamenting the \u201cmixed messages and an absence of clarity\u201d.\nBut the \u201cBoris distancing\u201d took hold even in papers previously sympathetic to the government\u2019s plight and even in those noted as fervent cheerleaders for Johnson. Look, for instance, at the Sun\u2019s unexpectedly pointed criticism in a leading article which echoed the Mirror\u2019s viewpoint.\nIt took Johnson to task for taking far too long in enacting legislation to enforce social distancing. \u201cThe Sun,\u201d it said, \u201chas largely backed the Downing Street response so far \u2026 But there is a shambolic \u2018on the hoof\u2019 feel to it now.\u201d\nAnother whose faith was shaken, was one of Johnson\u2019s most enthusiastic press supporters, the aforementioned title\u2019s political columnist, Trevor Kavanagh. Looking to a future public inquiry into the handling of the crisis, he suggested a likely outcome: \u201cIt may be that Boris Johnson was too soft, too trusting, too unwilling to make hard choices.\u201d\nIf Kavanagh\u2019s jibe surprised No 10, then the Times\u2019s leader last Monday must have come as a shock. Johnson\u2019s performance \u201chas been chequered\u201d. Why had he \u201cdisappeared from view\u201d in February? Why had he failed to preside over the first Cobra meeting to discuss the pandemic? Why, even as the scale became apparent, did he not take greater measures? The Times\u2019s conclusion was laced with sarcasm: \u201cThe country needs to know that Mr Johnson has a coherent strategy. Otherwise the prime minister who dreamt of being Churchill may find himself cast as Neville Chamberlain.\u201d\nAt the end of the week, the Daily Mail joined the growing chorus of disapproval by accusing the government of having been \u201clamentably behind the curve\u201d and urging it to \u201craise its game \u2026 fast\u201d. The Sunday Times took a similar line. Why had Britain not tested as widely and efficiently as Germany?\nThe Observer was amazed at the lack of testing kits, as it was with the failure to procure extra stocks of ventilators and personal protective equipment.\nThis media criticism should not be viewed as cynical or carping. Newspapers, in company with broadcast news outlets, have been doing their job. By refusing to accept the official narrative, they have disrupted the government\u2019s agenda and, on the positive side, have played a key role in changing the direction of public policy. They held power to account and found it wanting.\nNow, with parliament in recess, their job becomes even more important. They must go on questioning and harrying the prime minister. They have to find a way to ensure that an executive backed by an 81-seat majority does not misuse its own version of self-isolation to pursue the wrong route in the difficult weeks ahead.",

The aim is to identify those who are \u201chyperimmune\u201d to the virus and invite them to donate blood for the treatment.\nSo-called \u201cconvalescent plasma\u201d would be given to patients and their contacts in a number of clinical trials that are under consideration with medical funding bodies.\nProf David Tappin, a senior research fellow at the University of Glasgow, has applied to the National Institute for Health Research to run two clinical trials with convalescent plasma.\n\u201cStart-up will need to be faster than is normal, with most other trials usually taking months or years to get approvals and to begin,\u201d he said.\nThe World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.\nThe UN agency\u00a0advises\u00a0people to:\nMany countries are now enforcing or recommending curfews or lockdowns. Check with your local authorities for up-to-date information about the situation in your area.\u00a0\nIn the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should\u00a0stay at home for at least 7 days.\nIf you live with other people,\u00a0they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.\nThe trials will look for evidence that convalescent plasma can reduce infections in carers so they can continue their work, prevent patients deteriorating to the point that they require ventilation in ICUs, and improve the condition of those who are already severely ill, to reduce deaths and free up the much-needed ventilators, he said.\n\u201cTrials need to be undertaken, otherwise we will not know if this intervention is effective and worthwhile,\u201d Tappin said. \u201cIt may not be a silver bullet, or it may work for instance to stem the development of Covid-19 infection in contacts such as healthcare workers and their families, but not perhaps be as effective to treat severely ill patients being ventilated.\u201d\nProf Robert Lechler, the president of the Academy of Medical Sciences and executive director of King\u2019s Health Partners, comprising King\u2019s College London and three major London hospitals, said the group intended to conduct parallel trials of convalescent plasma.\nNHS Blood and Transplant has already begun work to identify potential donors, a spokesperson said.\n\u201cPlasma from patients who have recovered from Covid-19 will contain antibodies that their immune systems have produced in fighting the virus. That plasma can be transfused to very poorly patients whose own immune systems are struggling to develop their own antibodies. The plasma transfusion is therefore intended to provide the poorly patient with antibodies from a recovered patient to help their body fight the Covid-19 virus.\u201d\nSymptoms are defined by the NHS as either:\nNHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should\u00a0stay at home for at least 7 days.\nIf you live with other people,\u00a0they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.\nAfter 14 days, anyone you live with who does not have symptoms can return to their normal routine.

After receiving approval from the Food and Drug Administration, doctors in the US are now able to give plasma to patients under compassionate use rules.\nProf Arturo Casadevall, an infectious disease specialist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, who is involved in the US effort, said infusions of antibodies may be more effective if they are given early on to wipe out the virus before it causes serious damage. Potentially, he said, an infusion of convalescent plasma could protect people from the virus for several weeks.\nOn Friday, Chinese researchers reported that convalescent plasma appeared to help Covid-19 patients on ventilation, but the study involved only five patients.\nCasadevall has shared the US procedures with Tappin and Lechler to help them develop the procedure in the UK. \u201cI said, the best thing you can do is try and establish a network in the UK because ultimately all this is going to have to be done locally,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIf you look at history, this has a good chance of working. But it is a new virus and with a new virus you don\u2019t know until you know. The Chinese have been using it and they are reporting good results, but it needs to be tested. This is not a panacea or a miracle cure; it\u2019s something to try and put in place to see if we can help stem the epidemic,\u201d he said. \u201cI think you are going to need it in the UK.\u201d",

I\u2019m sorry. That\u2019s life.\u201d\nEstado de S\u00e3o Paulo said that at Saturday\u2019s summit \u2013 which was also attended by Brazil\u2019s justice and defence ministers \u2013 Mandetta tried to convince Bolsonaro of the gravity of the situation.\nHe reportedly said: \u201cAre we ready for the worst-case scenario, with army trucks transporting bodies through the streets? And cameras livestreaming that on the internet?\u201d\nMandetta, who is an orthopaedic doctor, noted that even 1,000 deaths would be the equivalent of four Boeing aircraft crashes.\nExperts believe far more people are likely to die. Recent modelling by researchers from Imperial College London suggested Brazil could have more than 1.1 million Covid-19 deaths if no action were taken to control the pandemic; 529,000 if only elderly people were forced to isolate; and 44,200 if drastic measures were implemented.\nBolsonaro\u2019s efforts to undermine regional governments\u2019 efforts to enforce such shutdowns have sparked a political rebellion by the governors of nearly all of Brazil\u2019s 27 states.\nSpeaking to the Guardian last week, Fl\u00e1vio Dino, the leftwing governor of Maranh\u00e3o, criticised Bolsonaro\u2019s denial of the dangers of coronavirus and his \u201ccatastrophic\u201d dawdling.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re on a battlefield and don\u2019t know which weapon to use, which direction to shoot, and when to open fire, you expose the whole army to serious harm,\u201d Dino said.",

Saudi Arabia is weaponising mobile technologies,\u201d the whistleblower claimed.\nThe data leaked by the whistleblower was also seen by telecommunications and security experts, who confirmed they too believed it was indicative of a surveillance campaign by Saudi Arabia.\nThe data shows requests for mobile phone location data that were routed through the decades-old SS7 global messaging system, which allows mobile operators to connect users around the world. For example, a mobile user from the US travelling in Germany and seeking to make a call back to the US is connected through the SS7 network.\nThe SS7 system also enables tracking of phones, which has been a cause for concern by security experts. When a US carrier \u2013 such as Verizon, T-Mobile or AT&T \u2013 receives what is known as a Provide Subscriber Information SS7 message (or PSI) from a foreign mobile phone operator, they are getting, in effect, a tracking request.\nSuch requests are legitimately used to help foreign operators register roaming charges. But excessive use of such messages is known in the mobile telecoms industry to be indicative of location tracking.\nExperts expressed alarm at the tracking request data because of the apparently persistent high frequency of the requests that appeared to be emanating from Saudi operators seeking to locate their subscribers once they entered the US.\nIt is not known whether the Saudi mobile operators that were requesting large amounts of location tracking data about their subscribers were knowingly complicit in any government\u2013run surveillance programme.\nHowever, it has already been widely reported that the Saudi government uses cyberweapons to hack dissidents and critics of the kingdom\u2019s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. In January the Guardian revealed that the Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos\u2019s mobile phone was \u201chacked\u201d in 2018 after receiving a WhatsApp message that had apparently been sent from the personal account of Prince Mohammed.\nOne Middle East expert, Andrew Miller, a former member of Barack Obama\u2019s national security council, said surveillance was part of the kingdom\u2019s modus operandi. \u201cI think they are surveilling not only those they know are dissidents, but those they fear may deviate from the Saudi leadership,\u201d Miller said. \u201cThey are particularly worried about what Saudi nationals will do when they are in western countries.\u201d\nThe whistleblower\u2019s data appears to show PSI requests from Saudi Arabia that pinged a major US mobile phone operator. It suggests that the three largest Saudi mobile operators \u2013 Saudi Telecom, Mobily and Zain \u2013 sent the US mobile phone operator a combined average of 2.3m tracking requests per month from 1 November 2019 to 1 March 2020.\nThe data appears to suggest the Saudi mobile phones were being tracked as they travelled through the US as often as two to 13 times per hour. Expert said that frequency suggests users could probably have been tracked on a map to within hundreds of metres of accuracy in a city.\nThe data seen by the Guardian did not identify the individual Saudi mobile users who were being tracked.\nThe Saudi embassies in Washington and London did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Neither did Saudi Telecom, Zain or Mobily.\nSid Rao, a security and privacy researcher and technologist at Nokia Bell Labs, said he believed the data indicated it was \u201chighly likely\u201d that the Saudis were engaged in a surveillance campaign, based on the magnitude of the location requests.\nRao said it could be difficult to determine how many PSI messages might be considered normal, but additional data provided by the whistleblower made him very confident that the requests were not legitimate.\nFor example, one of the Saudi operators also apparently sent separate location requests \u2013 known as PSL, or Provide Subscriber Location, requests \u2013 that were blocked by US mobile operators, indicating a high level of suspicious activity.\nJohn Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at the Citizen Lab at the Munk school at the University of Toronto, said the data seen by the Guardian appeared to show foreign agents \u201cflagrantly abusing\u201d the US cellular network to track people moving around the country.\n\u201cIn this moment of crisis, phone companies, regulators and the Department of Justice should step up to prevent foreign powers from tracking us through our phones,\u201d he said.\nThe Guardian requested comments from the three largest US mobile operators \u2013 T-Mobile, AT&T and Verizon \u2013 and asked the companies whether they allowed PSI tracking requests to be sent for location tracking purposes.\nT-Mobile and Verizon did not comment. AT&T said: \u201cWe have security controls to block location-tracking messages from roaming partners.\u201d\nRon Wyden, a Democratic senator from Oregon on the Senate intelligence committee, has previously said in a letter to the US telecoms regulator that \u201cmalicious attackers\u201d were exploiting SS7 vulnerabilities. He alleged that the Federal Communications Commission had failed to act on such warnings, and blamed the FCC chairman, Ajit Pai, for not regulating US carriers.\nIn a statement to the Guardian, Wyden said: \u201cBecause of [Pai\u2019s] inaction, if this report is true, an authoritarian government may be reaching into American wireless networks to track people inside our country.\u201d",

        "content": "My friend Sybil Crouch, who has died aged 66, was an influential figure in the arts in Wales. The first female chair of Arts Council Wales, she established Creu Cymru, a development agency for theatres and art centres, and until last year was director of the Taliesin Arts Centre and head of cultural services at Swansea University.\nCharismatic and inspirational, she led her teams with boldness, conviction and a big heart. At Taliesin her programme of film, performances and participation included an award-winning touring production of Under Milk Wood: An Opera, music by John Metcalf, and the critically acclaimed \u201cimmersive theatrical experience\u201d of Now the Hero/Nawr yr Awr in 2018.\nShe also expanded the cultural reputation of Wales abroad through exchanges and partnerships, including via Swansea\u2019s Dance Days, which were part of the Dancing Cities international network.\nSybil was born in Liverpool to David Crouch, a senior civil servant at the Department of Employment, and his wife, Lilian (nee Fletcher). After Birkenhead High School for Girls, in 1970 she went to Swansea School of Art, striding in on her first day wearing gold make up. She immediately became known as the \u201cgolden girl\u201d, and so she remained.\nAfter art school she taught and made a living for a while painting murals for premises in Swansea while also doing paid youth leader work until, in 1979, she applied for, and got, the post of deputy director of West Wales Arts. She stayed there until 1990, when she joined Taliesin Arts Centre.\nIn 1995 she was instrumental in setting up the Egypt Centre at Swansea University, which opened up the university\u2019s neglected collection of Egyptian artefacts to a wider, younger audience, and later she championed Welsh artists in the university\u2019s purpose-built Ceri Richards gallery. Alongside her work at Taliesin she had part-time roles as chair of Arts Council Wales from 1999 to 2003, deputy director of the Wales Film Council (2007-12) and as a director of the National Waterfront Museum in Swansea. For a time she was also an advisor to the Welsh government on arts and culture policy.\nA lifelong socialist, Sybil was elected as a Labour councillor for Swansea in 2012, and as cabinet minister for sustainability was instrumental in the creation of Swansea\u2019s \u201cstar path\u201d \u2013 a solar-powered walkway that lights up at night \u2013 and the establishment of various wildflower meadows in the city. A school governor, she was also involved in community initiatives such as the Vetch Veg community garden.\nSybil met David Phillips, who was also a Labour councillor, in 1979, when she was in Lampeter studying on an intensive course in Welsh, in which she became fluent. They were together for the next four decades, and were married in 2009.\nShe is survived by David, and by David\u2019s son, Andrew.",

But conservationists say the impact is not all positive, with wildlife crimes going unreported and vital work including monitoring impossible to carry out.\nJake Fiennes, conservation manager of the 9,600-acre Holkham national nature reserve, the biggest in England, said his staff were excited to record what unfolds on the Norfolk beach, salt marsh and grasslands.\n\u201cWe have annual visitor numbers in excess of one million and suddenly, in the peak of breeding season, they are not going to be here. Nature is just going, \u2018Ahhh, it\u2019s all to ourselves now,\u2019\u201d he said.\nAs at all British nature reserves, public footpaths through Holkham are open but car parks and visitor centres are closed.\nFiennes and his fellow wardens have already noticed more sparrowhawks, stoats and deer on once heavily walked tracks.\n\u201cThe greatest impact we might see will be on the shorebirds,\u201d said Fiennes. He hopes the shutdown will be a boon to beach-nesting birds including oystercatchers, sandwich terns and the endangered ringed plover.\nLast summer, for the first time in living memory, no oystercatchers nested on Holkham beach. Although areas of beach are cordoned off for birds, increases in footfall including dog walkers are thought to be behind the declines there.\nIf the lockdown is lifted in the middle of bird-nesting season, the impact could be catastrophic, Fiennes said. \u201cAll these species nest where they think they are safe \u2013 and then we open the gates,\u201d he said.\nAccording to naturalist Matthew Oates, there are parallels with the shutdown of the countryside during the 2001 foot and mouth crisis. \u201cWhen we move out, obviously nature moves in,\u201d he said. \u201cDog prints and dog faeces are gone, and there are fox and weasel prints instead.\u201d\nOates believes that people are already appreciating \u201cthe gathering quietude\u201d. \u201cOne of the positive things that could come out of this is the realisation that machinery noise damages us and damages our minds,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout traffic and aeroplane noise, we hear the birds again and the wind. Last night I swear I heard the wings of a tawny owl as it flew over, which I haven\u2019t heard for decades.\u201d\nPhoebe Miles at Plantlife has noted a proliferation of sightings of moles above ground near well-walked footpaths. She is also struck by residents of cities such as Bristol, where she lives, newly absorbing their neighbourhood\u2019s nature.\n\u201cIt\u2019s being with the detail of everyday nature which is so beautiful,\u201d she said. \u201cYes, you can hear the birds singing because there\u2019s no traffic, but you can also see the detail that\u2019s always been in front of you. There are a lot of very beautiful small plants coming out at this time \u2013 ivy-leaved toadflax, wall screw moss, umbrella liverwort, rue-leaved saxifrage \u2013 and it\u2019s touching to see children and adults getting drawn into this.\u201d\nSocial distancing day 3: went birding around @uniofeastanglia campus and stumbled across this mole foraging above ground! Very cool to witness. pic.twitter.com/FlcYy0C9pH\nHS2 is facing accusations from opponents that its destruction of ancient woodlands is going ahead during lockdown so that any potential illegal damage to birds\u2019 nests, for instance, would go unnoticed.\n\u201cIn some areas, the absence of eyes and ears on the ground might be really problematic, with bird of prey persecution or disturbance of little tern colonies going unseen,\u201d said Martin Harper, global conservation director of the RSPB. The charity has urged members of the public to report any illegal destruction of birds\u2019 nests by HS2 to the police.\nConservation work is also being disrupted. Harper said he feared for schemes such as Operation Turtle Dove, in which farmers provide spring food for turtle doves, one of Britain\u2019s most endangered birds. With supply chains disrupted and \u201cnon-essential\u201d work cut, the turtle dove feeding is likely to be curtailed.\nWhile garden nature is set to be better observed than ever, with surges in participation in schemes such as Butterfly Conservation\u2019s garden butterfly survey, conservationists fear the wider wildlife boom will go unrecorded.\nSome of the volunteer army of wildlife surveyors who contribute to the Breeding Bird Survey and Plantlife\u2019s species monitoring work are incorporating their recordings into their daily dose of exercise, as permitted under the lockdown conditions, but many risk-averse conservation charities are cancelling monitoring programmes because they are not deemed essential work.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mixture of hope and extreme frustration,\u201d said Plantlife\u2019s Jo Jones. \u201cThe biggest issue is missing out on the yearly data.\u201d\nAccording to Jones, extremely rare plants such as prostrate perennial knawel could easily be accidentally covered in dumped rubbish or destroyed without regular monitoring. \u201cTo understand what these plants are doing, you have to go and watch them and understand if conservation work is helping them or not,\u201d she said.\nBut Jones is also hopeful that the lockdown will encourage home-schooled children and their parents to notice the wildlife around them. \u201cWe could have a re-engagement with nature and plants, and that is for everybody, wherever they live.\u201d",

        "content": "Gordon Jackson refers himself to legal watchdog after being filmed on train\nScotland\u2019s most senior lawyer, who defended Alex Salmond at his sexual assault trial, has referred himself to the country\u2019s legal watchdog after footage emerged that appears to show him identifying the complainants on a busy commuter train.\nLast week a jury at the high court in Edinburgh found the former first minister not guilty of 12 sexual assaults, including one attempted rape. It also concluded that another charge of intent to rape was \u201cnot proven\u201d, a Scottish legal formulation which stops short of a not guilty verdict but finds the accused innocent in the eyes of the law.\nDuring and since the trial, the nine women who alleged assaults by the former Scottish National party leader have faced an onslaught of abuse online and on Sunday morning released a joint statement in which they described their \u201cdevastation\u201d at the verdict. It is understood that they have been issued with personal alarms and have been offered home security checks by police.\nGordon Jackson QC was condemned for his \u201chorrifying and completely unacceptable\u201d comments after the Sunday Times reported he had been overheard making the remarks on board an Edinburgh to Glasgow train during the first week of the trial and that his conversation had been filmed by a passenger.\nJackson, who is dean of the Faculty of Advocates, appears to name two of the women who alleged sexual assaults by Salmond, in contravention of rules that protect the anonymity of complainers \u2013 as they are known in Scotland \u2013 in such cases.\nSandy Brindley, the chief executive of Rape Crisis Scotland, called for an investigation, saying: \u201cProtecting the anonymity of all people who report sexual crimes is of critical importance and is one of few reassurances that can be offered as part of an otherwise daunting and intimidating process.\n\u201cFor this to be undermined by such a senior lawyer in a public place in such a high-profile trial is horrifying and completely unacceptable. Jackson is dean of the Faculty of Advocates and we cannot see how this behaviour \u2013 caught on film \u2013 is in keeping with the Faculty of Advocates\u2019 own guidance on conduct. There should be an immediate investigation.\u201d\nIn the footage, Jackson can be heard saying: \u201cThis is hardly sexual \u2026 sex offenders register? Not for you. Inappropriate, arsehole, stupid \u2026 but sexual? Unfortunately, [names one complainer] and [names another complainer] say it\u2019s sexual.\u201d\nJackson also says of Salmond: \u201cI don\u2019t know much about senior politicians but he was quite an objectionable bully to work with in a way I don\u2019t think Nicola [Sturgeon] is. I think he was a nasty person to work for \u2026 a nightmare to work for.\u201d\nReferring to one complainer, he says: \u201cWe thought that eventually people might think she\u2019s a flake and not like her,\u201d and goes on to discusses his defence tactics with another woman, saying: \u201cAll I need to do is put a smell on her.\u201d\nBrindley said: \u201cOne of the most chilling aspects of this is Jackson\u2019s statement about his strategy for the cross-examination of one of the women in the trial: \u2018All I need to do is put a smell on her.\u2019 This statement alone confirms the fears of many who do not report for fear of what would be done to them in court. We need an urgent overhaul of how these cases are dealt with.\u201d\nIn a statement released on Twitter, Jackson said: \u201cI have decided that the proper course of action is to self-refer this matter to the Scottish Legal Complaints Commission, and that has been done. It will be for the Commission to consider this matter.\n\u201cI also deeply regret the distress and difficulties which have been caused, but given the reference to the SLCC it would not be appropriate to comment further.\u201d\nA spokesperson for Salmond: \u201cMr Salmond \u2026 made a statement on the steps of the high court and said that he would make no further public comment on these matters until after the coronavirus crisis was over.\u201d",

We need to be united not just with research with the vaccines, but the measures we are taking to ensure the economic mire is not too deep,\u201d Montchalin told France Inter radio.\n\u201cWe need to prepare together how to get out of this crisis and relaunch [economies]; we need to prepare for afterwards and show that we are efficient because we are together.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cCan we continue to work at 27 if there are those who are not showing solidarity? Those who don\u2019t want to show this solidarity need to consider their position. EU members will need to ask how they make decisions as a group of 27 if they cannot decide on financial support for coronavirus-hit nations.\u201d\nEarlier, Jacques Delors, 94, a former European commission president, issued a rare statement saying divisions between northern and southern member states during a European council meeting on Thursday pointed to \u201cmortal danger\u201d for the bloc.\nA rift emerged after the Dutch finance minister, Wopke Hoekstra, reportedly called for an investigation into why some EU member states lacked the financial capacity to weather the coronavirus crisis.\nPortugal\u2019s prime minister, Ant\u00f3nio Costa, described Hoekstra\u2019s comments \u2013 which appeared to be directed at southern European members \u2013 as \u201crepugnant\u201d.\nCosta is among those who have said the pandemic could pose an existential threat to the EU. \u201cIf the EU wants to survive, it\u2019s unacceptable for any political figure \u2013 wherever they\u2019re from \u2013 to give that kind of answer given the pandemic we\u2019re living through,\u201d Costa said.\nSpain\u2019s prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, issued a similar warning on Friday. \u201cWe\u2019re facing the worst crisis of this generation,\u201d he said. \u201cThe future of the European project is at stake and we need to choose between individualism and a coordinated, supportive EU. We are profoundly pro-European and we are seeking a common response to this emergency.\u201d\nS\u00e1nchez went further on Saturday night when he told Spaniards: \u201cIt\u2019s Europe\u2019s time to act. Europe is at risk.\u201d\nSpain\u2019s foreign minister, Arancha G\u00f3nzalez Laya, also responded bluntly to Hoekstra on Twitter. \u201cWe\u2019re all in the same European boat,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe\u2019ve hit an iceberg and now we\u2019re all running the same risks. There\u2019s no time for discussions about supposedly first and second class citizens. This isn\u2019t the time to defraud our citizens.\u201d\nG\u00f3nzalez Laya reminded the Dutch minister that \u201cthis is 2020, not 2008\u201d, adding: \u201cThe pandemic is affecting all of us. It\u2019s not about the failure of one sector or one geographic region.\u201d",

        "content": "Billionaire Topshop magnate is planning to stop cash injections during pandemic\nSir Philip Green has been urged not to use coronavirus as an excuse to stop payments into the Topshop retirement scheme, as a pensions expert called on the billionaire\u2019s Monaco-based wife, Tina, to plug any shortfall.\nArcadia Group, the parent company of the Green family\u2019s retail empire, is planning to halt cash injections into the firm\u2019s pension fund as it seeks to conserve cash to survive the coronavirus crisis that has dealt a devastating blow to retailers.\nBut MP Rachel Reeves said businesses \u201cwill need to answer for their decisions during this pandemic and whether they did the right thing by workers and pension holders\u201d. She said the pandemic should not be used as an excuse to reduce pension provision for loyal staff.\nJohn Ralfe, who has previously advised MPs investigating the collapse of Green\u2019s defunct retail chain BHS, said there was no reason to leave the scheme \u201cshort-changed\u201d.\nArcadia\u2019s plan involves postponing payments that were agreed with the Pensions Regulator last year as Green sought a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), a controversial form of insolvency, to keep the retail group afloat.\nThe regulator and pension trustees agreed to allow the company to halve contributions into the Arcadia scheme from \u00a350m a year to \u00a325m, in exchange for Tina Green pledging to put in \u00a3100m to make up for the shortfall. The deal involved Lady Green paying in instalments of \u00a325m a year from her own wealth, plus an extra one-off \u00a325m payment.\nWhile Philip Green chairs the business, it is owned by Tina Green, based in tax-free Monaco. The Green family took a \u00a31.2bn dividend from the company in 2005, while Tina Green was paid \u00a325m by the retail group in 2017.\nWhile Arcadia plans to suspend the company\u2019s immediate contributions to the pension scheme, it said the payments from Tina Green would continue and would arrive on time.\nBut Ralfe said the company could avoid suspending any pension contributions during the coronavirus crisis if she agreed to bring forward the \u00a3100m in contributions rather than staggering them.\n\u201cIf Arcadia wants to delay its payments to conserve cash flow, then Lady Tina should bring forward her payments so the pension scheme gets the same amount,\u201d Ralfe said. \u201cGiven Lady Tina\u2019s significant net worth, the Pensions Regulator must ensure that coronavirus is not an excuse for the Arcadia pension scheme to be short-changed.\n\u201cThe latest Arcadia annual report at August 2018 shows a \u00a3138m deficit \u2013 \u00a3931m assets and \u00a31.07bn liabilities \u2013 which today will be around \u00a390m, given deficit contributions and other movements.\n\u201cIf Arcadia were to enter administration, the deficit would be much higher, at \u00a3350m\u2013\u00a3400m.\u201d\nRalfe has previously advised a parliamentary committee examining the demise of BHS, which Green sold for \u00a31 to former bankrupt Dominic Chappell. Following an outcry from MPs and the public, the billionaire eventually agreed to pay \u00a3363m to prop up the collapsed company\u2019s pension scheme.\nArcadia declined to comment.",

The Principality Stadium in Cardiff will be converted into an emergency field hospital, while London\u2019s ExCel conference centre will house 4,000 temporary beds.\nStevenage of League Two have launched a hotline for the over-70s to signpost services and offer food deliveries, with their chief executive, Alex Tunbridge, saying: \u201cWe are no longer a football club at present. We are turning the club into a community careline.\u201d\nThe NHS began installing equipment at Plymouth on Thursday, while IT, telephone connections and signage have since been set up. There is scope for Argyle to hand their entire stadium to the NHS, with the majority of the club\u2019s 70 full-time staff working remotely while a skeleton team tend to the stadium.\n\u201cWe have left the door open for that to happen. It works in that those non-emergency cases and routine things can be done. If necessary we could use different parts of the stadium as well to do different activities. There are four separate stands and all of those can be used in one form or another. It is easy to think football is just a game but it\u2019s so much more than that. It\u2019s part of people\u2019s lives, routines and it\u2019s important from a social aspect. It is only right that it serves to be a community asset, particularly at this time.\u201d\nPlymouth have also raised almost \u00a325,000 since launching a crowdfunding campaign with the aim of supporting local suppliers, pledging to donate one match ticket to NHS staff from Devon and Cornwall for every \u00a3100 raised.\n\u201cIf we can be successful without kicking a ball to help save people\u2019s lives, that to me is a big yes,\u201d says Ryan Lowe, the Plymouth manager. \u201cThere are parents, nurses and doctors putting their bodies on the line and not going home to see their families, so it is great we can do something to give back.\n\u201cFootball has taken a back step and rightly so because it\u2019s not about football and we\u2019re doing our bit to help that. Everyone is missing football and desperate to get back playing but ultimately the most important thing is to save lives and stop this cruel virus.\u201d",

All non-essential workers are being ordered to stay at home for two weeks from Monday.\nFernando Sim\u00f3n, head of Spain\u2019s centre for health emergencies, said the situation was stabilising, but \u201cthe main problem is making sure intensive care units aren\u2019t overloaded\u201d. ICUs in six of Spain\u2019s 17 autonomous regions were at full capacity.\nItaly on Sunday reported 756 new deaths, taking its total to 10,779. The rate slowed for a second day, while new confirmed cases rose by 5.6% to 3,815. This was the lowest increase of the epidemic so far, offering some hope that it may be nearing its peak there.\nSpain and Italy account for more than half of the world\u2019s death toll from Covid-19 and are each still seeing hundreds of deaths a day. According to the Johns Hopkins University tracker, the virus has now infected more than 680,000 people and killed more than 32,000 around the world.\nSpain\u2019s prime minister, Pedro S\u00e0nchez, described the crisis as \u201cthe most difficult moment for the EU since its foundation\u201d and said the 27-member bloc had to be \u201cready to rise to the challenge \u2026 It\u2019s Europe\u2019s time to act.

It\u2019s absolutely crucial that we air out these intensive care units,\u201d said Francois Brun, head of emergency services at the regional hospital in Metz.\nA German military plane was also used to carry patients from Alsace to hospitals in Stuttgart and Ulm. Nearly 4,300 patients are in intensive care in France, which is racing to treble its ICU bed capacity from about 5,000.\nIn other developments:\nMoscow went into full lockdown: no one to leave the house except to go to the nearest shop or pharmacy or walk pets up to 100m from the house.\nPatrick Devedjian, a former French cabinet minister and prominent local politician, died in hospital after being tested positive. He was 75.\nThomas Schaefer, the finance minister of Germany\u2019s Hesse state, took his own life apparently after becoming \u201cdeeply worried\u201d about how to cope with the economic fallout from the epidemic.\nThe main opposition candidate in Polish presidential elections called for the vote to be boycotted if the government insists on going ahead with it on 10 May.\nPope Francis called for a ceasefire in all conflicts around the globe to focus on the \u201cfight of our lives\u201d against Covid-19.\nEgypt shut its beaches as cases in the Middle East surpassed 50,000.\nAustralia\u2019s prime minister, Scott Morrison, announced further restrictions including limiting public gatherings to just two people.\nAll travellers entering South Korea will face two weeks of mandatory quarantine starting at midnight next Wednesday.\nTokyo confirmed 68 new coronavirus cases, another record daily increase.\nChina continued to relax restrictions, with flights from Hubei province and tube and bus services in Wuhan city, the centre of the outbreak, resuming this weekend.\nIran\u2019s president, Hassan Rouhani, said on Sunday that the \u201cnew way of life\u201d in Iran was likely to be prolonged, as the country\u2019s death toll rose to 2,640 and its number of officially confirmed cases to 38,309. \u201cWe must prepare to live with this virus until a treatment or vaccine is discovered,\u201d he said.\nIn the US, which has reported nearly 125,000 cases and where the death toll has more than doubled in three days, Anthony Fauci, the country\u2019s leading infectious diseases expert, said it could expect more than 100,000 deaths and millions of infections.\nDonald Trump backtracked on a threat to quarantine New York and neighbouring states, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a warning against all non-essential travel in the region.\n\u201cDue to extensive community transmission of Covid-19 in the area, CDC urges residents of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut to refrain from non-essential domestic travel for 14 days effective immediately,\u201d the warning said.",

More than 300 turtles have hatched there this year.\nCouto said the animals normally lay their eggs from January each year and that the hatchlings emerge in April or May. \u201cIt\u2019s really beautiful because you can see the exact instant they come out of the eggs and \u2026 watch their little march across the beach,\u201d Couto said. \u201cIt\u2019s marvellous. It\u2019s a wonderful, extraordinary feeling.\n\u201cThis time, because of coronavirus, we couldn\u2019t even tell people it was happening.\u201d\nC\u00e2mara said he hoped the coronavirus restrictions could eventually be relaxed in his state, which is home to about nine million of Brazil\u2019s 209 million citizens. But for now, they are essential. \u201cBrazil isn\u2019t ready for an exponential growth [in cases], so we need to buy time \u2026 so we can put together the infrastructure to treat as many infected people as possible,\u201d he said.",

        "content": "British-Iranian dual national has had her temporary release from prison extended because of the coronavirus outbreak\nNazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British-Iranian dual national on temporary release from a five-year jail sentence, is for the first time under formal consideration for clemency, her family has been told. A decision will be made by the highest level of Iran\u2019s multi-layered government. There is no guarantee that clemency will be granted, or that she will be allowed to return to the UK.\nZaghari-Ratcliffe, seen by some as a bargaining chip in the wider diplomatic dispute between the UK and Iran, was given a temporary fortnight\u2019s release from Evin prison, Tehran, on 17 March along with 85,000 other prisoners at risk from the coronavirus outbreak. She has been allowed to stay at her parents\u2019 house in Tehran but made to wear an ankle brace that keeps her within 300 metres of her parents\u2019 home.\nAll prisoners sentenced for five years or less were given temporary release, permitting half of all Iran\u2019s political prisoners to be freed.\nThe supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, announced early last week that what had initially been seen as a fortnight\u2019s release for furloughed prisoners had been extended to early April since there was no sign that the coronavirus pandemic was easing. Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s inclusion in that extension was only confirmed to the family by the prison on Saturday.\nArrested in April 2016, she was sentenced in September to five years in jail. Her sentence is due to come to an end within 10 months unless new charges are levelled against her - something the Islamic revolutionary guards corps has threatened in the past.\nThe potential offer of clemency, relayed to Nazanin\u2019s father by the prison authorities at the weekend, will be recommended to the Iranian prosecutor general\u2019s office. Her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, described the move as \u201cpotentially a baby step towards freedom\u201d. \u201cI spoke to her yesterday and her mood was pretty upbeat,\u201d he said.\nRatcliffe told the Guardian: \u201cThe deputy prosecutor can either approve clemency or refer the file back to the supreme leader\u2019s office with a recommendation that she not be granted clemency, or it could just sit on his desk for a bit.\n\u201cThe supreme leader can refuse a recommendation not to grant clemency, or can follow it and specify that Nazanin not be granted. But the default in the process following the supreme leader\u2019s proclamation last week is that the law requires eligible people to be granted clemency.\n\u201cSo it is a good that her file has been put forward \u2013 an acknowledgement by the judiciary that she is formally eligible, and she is being treated so far like everyone else.\u201d\nHe and his wife, 41, have suffered painful false dawns before, partly because the Iranian political system has many different centres of decision-making.\nBritish officials believe any decision to grant her clemency will be taken at the highest level, including an assessment of the wider political benefits to Iran in winning support for the lifting of sanctions. Zaghari-Ratcliffe has deliberately made no political statement since her release from jail, but the pressure to release other prisoners is intense, with reports of unrest in prisons continuing this weekend.\nThe Iranian foreign ministry has been mounting an increasingly effective international campaign, including with American Democrats, to turn up the diplomatic heat on the US for its refusal to suspend economic sanctions to help Iran purchase medical equipment needed to help fight the pandemic. Britain has been privately urging Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, to see if the US can remove any blocks to a new Swiss channel, the Swiss humanitarian trade arrangement, that is supposed to ease the flow of humanitarian supplies to Iran.\nInternational bankers say they still do not have sufficient reassurance from the US Treasury that they will not be sanctioned if they finance the trade. At the same time, Iran has been seeking help in securing a $5bn (\u00a34bn) IMF loan, something the US could block. A reformist MP from Tehran, Alireza Rahimi, tweeted on Sunday that the IMF was going to release \u201ca substantial portion\u201d of the loan.\nThe Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, said: \u201cThe US government had moved from sabotage to assassinations to waging an economic war and economic terrorism on Iranians and now to medical terrorism. This even exceeds what is permissible on the battlefield.\u201d\nHowever, hardliners are determined to send out a message that the government can ride out the crisis alone, and seem mainly eager to take aim at the failure of Europe and the US to bring the pandemic under control.\nPressure has also been mounting on the sometimes incoherent Iranian leadership over its handling of the pandemic. The Iranian health ministry on Sunday announced a further 2,901 new coronavirus cases in the previous 24 hours, taking the total number of cases to 38,309. The 24-hour total of new infections has ballooned in the past five days from below 900 new infections in a week.\nThe official total death toll is only 2,640, and the daily recorded deaths are broadly static, something that is hard to reconcile with the higher level of infections. The death toll is a quarter of Spain\u2019s, and may be due to Iran\u2019s decision to classify some deaths as caused by respiratory difficulties rather than coronavirus.\nFollowing weeks of pressure to take tougher steps, Iran\u2019s president, Hassan Rouhani, finally introduced physical distancing and city quarantines. An emergency 2,000-bed hospital has been built in Tehran, reflecting the pressure in the capital. A total of 3,467 patients are described as \u201cin severe condition\u201d.",

The advice ranges from maintaining contact with friends and family with regular phone or video calls, keeping to a regular routine and sleep pattern, and focusing on a hobby.\nThe Mental Health Foundation started work on the project with the Institute of Public Health at Cambridge University, and is now expanding involvement to include Swansea University and academic institutions in Scotland and Northern Ireland.\nThe decision to survey the nation\u2019s mental health under the unprecedented clampdown on movement and social interaction followed a YouGov poll the charity commissioned last week which found that nearly two-thirds of adults from a representative sample of 2,100 people felt anxious or worried about the outbreak.\n\u201cThe mental health impact of the pandemic is going to last longer than the physical health impact,\u201d said Dr Antonis Kousoulis, the Mental Health Foundation\u2019s research director. He said the charity intended to boost the number of people taking part in the poll from Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland to improve their representation. The polls are expected to run for four months but may be extended if necessary.\nKousoulis said the surveys should reveal how people across society are responding to the outbreak in the UK and to news of the virus\u2019s global impact. One red flag will be signs that mild stress and anxiety, which can help by encouraging people to adhere to public health advice, are developing into chronic conditions that can become serious mental health problems.\nParticipants in the polls will also be asked about the causes of any distress to determine whether the most worrisome issues are debt, job insecurity, home life, concerns about contracting the virus or having loved ones infected, or other issues.\nFurther questions are intended to reveal how people are coping throughpositive interactions such as social media groups, video chats and help from local groups, and whether there is a parallel increase in drinking and drug taking.\nThe charity\u2019s latest poll found that 18 to 24-year-olds were most anxious about being separated from friends and family if they had to self-isolate. Kousoulis said he was also concerned about the over-70s, who are most at risk from the virus and may not be well equipped to keep in touch with others online. \u201cWe basically have a whole generation that is being asked to stay at home for 12 weeks with even more limited interactions than the rest of us,\u201d he said.\nPandemics have historically tended to hit poorer regions hardest, and the same trend could emerge with coronavirus. \u201cWe know that the risk to mental health is not distributed equally. We know that people who are in poorer households and neighbourhoods tend to be more at risk,\u201d Kousoulis said.\nLinda Bauld, a professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh, said some adults who are working from home or are looking after patients may be at risk of drinking, smoking and taking drugs. \u201cI think we need to recognise that these physical and mental health damaging behaviours are going to increase,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to pay much more attention to this and offer practical advice and support in the weeks ahead.\u201d",

He now concedes events necessitated action.\n\u201cWe\u2019re no different from everyone else out there but we just concluded that sport, on this occasion, had to take a back seat,\u201d Coe told TalkSport. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to have the athletes in a position where they were countering government advice, maybe even breaking the law.\n\u201cAnd of course in the back of their minds was always that concern, it wasn\u2019t just their own training programme, but that they ran the risk of effectively infecting themselves, their families, their kids, grandparents or parents, and we just wanted to take them out of that mental turmoil as quickly as we possibly could.\u201d\nBach has setup an IOC taskforce called Here We Go whose brief is to work with 33 international sports federations about setting new dates for the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics. Among the considerations is staging the Games in the spring of next year. \u201cThe agreement is that we want to organise these Games at the latest in the summer 2021,\u201d Bach said. \u201cThis is not restricted just to the summer months. All the options are on the table including the summer 2021.\u201d\nThe new head of UK Athletics has vowed to restore belief in an organisation that has been mired in controversy. Joanna Coates, appointed chief executive late last year, is well aware of the negative focus triggered by the results of its independent review into the handling of Alberto Salazar, Mo Farah\u2019s former coach. Neil Black, the UKA performance director, became the latest senior figure to leave his role before another review was launched, this time by UK Sport.\n\u201cThe board has given me the remit to make changes to ensure this organisation gets back to where it should be,\u201d Coates told the Sunday Telegraph. \u201cThere will be major change in the organisation, and that doesn\u2019t just mean people. That means policy, procedures, how we liaise with other organisations.\u201d\n\u201cI do not want medals at all costs. I hope Dina [Asher-Smith] wins. I believe she will and we want her to. But it\u2019s about her story, her journey in athletics and what athletics can bring to anybody that participates. That\u2019s what it should be about.\u201d",

Ocado refused to state from which company it had bought the tests.\nWhile Ocado has managed to source testing kits for staff contributing to the food supply effort, nurses and doctors have been left waiting.\nA spokesperson for Waitrose said the supermarket had no plans to order kits but it had put in place measures to protect both staff and customers, while Morrisons said it was \u201copen-minded\u201d on testing and was waiting for a government-approved plan. Sainsbury\u2019s and Tesco did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nOcado said testing would help ensure staff can continue \u201cworking round the clock\u201d to get as much food delivered to as many homes as possible, with demand 10 times higher than average.\nIts ordering service has buckled under the strain of rocketing orders, prompting its chairman, Stuart Rose, to urge Britons to stop stockpiling groceries, insisting \u201cnobody will starve\u201d during the coronavirus outbreak.\n\u201cNo matter how hard we work, we do not have enough capacity to serve these unprecedented levels of demand,\u201d Ocado said in an emailed statement.\n\u201cOur priorities are the safety and wellbeing of our customers, colleagues and the community.\u201d\nThe kits will allow Ocado to test grocery packers and delivery drivers who have emerged as one of the most vital segments of the workforce during the coronavirus crisis because of their role in bringing food to those who cannot leave the house.\nAnyone involved in the production, processing, distribution, sale and delivery of food has been given \u201ckey worker\u201d status, affording them certain privileges such as permission to send their children to school.\nOcado said if it were asked to do so, it would hand over testing kits to the government to ensure that health workers were first in line.\n\u201cOcado is clear that the NHS takes priority in the national effort to combat coronavirus and kits will be made available to the NHS if and where required,\u201d it said.\nThe government has said that tests for NHS healthcare workers will be rolled out next week, allowing them to confirm whether they have been infected or are safe to work.\nIt bought 3.5m of the kits but has been criticised over the time it has taken for them to reach frontline staff most at risk of contracting the virus from patients.\nWhile key workers have had to wait to be tested, private health firms have come under fire for selling thousands of test kits to wealthy buyers for up to \u00a3295 each.\nPublic Health England said last week that mass home-testing would be possible \u201cwithin days\u201d via a procedure that involves pricking the finger to produce a drop of blood, which is then analysed by a device. The test is being validated in Oxford to ensure it works.\nThe health body said the kits would soon be available on the high street, or to order via Amazon\u2019s delivery service.\nBut Prof Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser, later played down the idea that millions of the tests would be available on the internet this week.\nHigh street pharmacist Boots said on Friday night that it had agreed to help the government open drive-through Covid-19 testing facilities by assisting with recruitment of staff, although it has no plans to test in stores.",

You start to see ecosystems fall apart and then struggle to recover before the next major disturbance.\u201d\nThe Australia\u2019s Environment report scored environmental conditions across seven indicators \u2013 inundation, streamflow, vegetation growth, leaf area, soil protection, tree cover and the number of hot days.\nAcross all years analysed, 2005 was the next worst year, impacted by the millennium drought. The year 2010 was the best; it was also one of Australia\u2019s wettest on record.\nVan Dijk said the cause of the impacts for 2019 were global heating as well as natural variability in Australia\u2019s climate. The number of days above 35C was 36% higher than the previous 19 years.\nThe population had continued to grow and the country\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions had remained high, the report said.\nGreenhouse gas emissions per person were 11% below the 2000-18 average, but remained among the highest in the world because of high energy use per person and the burning of coal for electricity.\nFindings were underpinned by about 1m gigabytes of data, including satellite data that only became available from 2000, as well as field data and on-the-ground surveys.\nReviewing biodiversity impacts, the report highlighted the number of spectacled flying foxes \u2013 one of many species vulnerable to heat stress \u2013 had dropped to 47,000 from an average of 100,000 before 2016.\nThe numbers of threatened species had risen by 36% since 2000, the report said.\nRiver flows were 43% below the 2000-18 average, causing water storages to drop and mass fish deaths in the Murray-Darling Basin, and wetland environments had also seen record-low inundation.\nRiver flows were above average around the coast of northern Queensland, around Karratha in Western Australia and at Strahan in Tasmania\u2019s west.\nThe protection of soils by vegetation and moisture was \u201cextremely poor\u201d, causing dust storms. The average soil moisture was also lowest since at least 2000 and farming productivity had been hit.\nThe Great Barrier Reef, which has just experienced its third mass bleaching event in five years, had escaped bleaching in 2019 but its condition remained poor.\nWorld heritage-listed Gondwana rainforests, the Blue Mountains, alpine regions, eastern Gippsland and Kangaroo Island had all been badly hit by bushfires.\nA co-author of the report, Dr Marta Yebra, said: \u201cOur data clearly shows that the combination of dry forests and hot weather made for an especially explosive mixture.\u201d\nAll the findings and data from the report, now in its fifth year, can be viewed on a website and interactive map.",

How do we prepare for the sadness that will be thrust upon us? \n Join Tim Costello as he gives the inaugural Australia at Home lunchtime briefing at 1pm \nLike many people, I am re-reading The Plague by Albert Camus. I haven\u2019t picked it up for years.\n\u201cThe first thing the plague brought to our town was exile ... It was undoubtedly the feeling of exile \u2013 that sensation of a void within which never left us ... they drifted through life rather than lived, the prey of aimless days and sterile memories, like wandering shadows that could have acquired substance only by consenting to root themselves in the solid earth of their distress.\u201d\nWe are bracing ourselves for the full force of a once-in-a-century pandemic that will hit us like a tsunami in the coming weeks. We are watching the trailer with the devastating images from hospitals in Italy and emptied streets in Madrid, London and New York. The daily death tolls on our morning social media feeds haunt us like a shadow all day.\nTo keep each other safe, we are preparing to pay an unprecedented economic cost, closing entire sectors of the economy, wiping billions off our super and stocks, putting tens or even hundreds of thousands of people out of work.\nBut I\u2019m concerned that over the coming weeks we fall into the trap of kidding ourselves this is the crisis, that the preparations and changes to our normal routines represent the full impact of this cruel virus.\nBecause this exile is not the crisis \u2013 it is the beginning of the crisis. We may have moved to higher ground, but the wave of illness and death is yet to hit. And when it comes, many of our fellow Australians will die alone or in crowded hospitals.\nAs we mobilise for action on these fronts, I am concerned we are not preparing for the wave of grief that will have to be expressed alone, in ways totally foreign to our natural instinct to come together and physically embrace each other.\nHow will someone mourn the passing of their parent if they can\u2019t sit with them in their final hours? How will we mark the loss of friends and colleagues when we aren\u2019t allowed the time and space to honour them? How will local communities cope when loved health workers die?\nHow do we prepare for the sadness that will be thrust upon us?\nWe must prepare to rediscover the art of lament.\nLament is a one of those words that seems to have lost its meaning. Lament is not a label to put on a person or a situation \u2013 it\u2019s the communal sharing of this grief, an act of solidarity that ensures no one needs to grieve alone, despite our physical distance.\nIf we are going to find a way to lament through the coming months, we need to start now by actively participating in our shared sense of exile. As Camus reminds us, it is about giving wandering shadows substance by rooting ourselves in the solid earth of our distress.\nSharing exile can take many forms, but it starts with developing common rituals \u2013 whether it is joining in online church services or choral events freely available, lighting a candle with friends across a Zoom meeting, clapping our valiant health workers on our doorstep at 8pm each evening or singing from balconies like the Lombards.\nIt\u2019s also about meditating on what we are grateful for \u2013 family, friends, a room with a view \u2013 even in quarantine we need to find meaning in our lives, to know we are seen, that our pain is validated by others and to know we are loved.\nAt these times of lament, charities have always filled an important role \u2013 to organise the collective support for the one in need, anchored in a common benevolent love of humanity.\nBut even here the virus challenges us. Many of our charities are facing their own crises, first in the largely older volunteer force who do the work and, inevitably, facing a reduction in the amount of money people can afford to donate to support their work.\nSome of these institutions may not survive, others will need to fundamentally rethink their delivery models, but what will remain constant is the need for the act of charity, that benevolent love of humanity, to sustain us.\nThat\u2019s why the nation\u2019s major charities are coming together to create a \u201cCharities Cabinet\u201d to advise the government on ways we can deliver all our citizens the basics of a roof, a meal, a sense of human connection and a reminder that in the midst of global mayhem every individual matters. Charities exist to prioritise the needs of the vulnerable; whether they have insecure housing, or no housing. All indeed matter. Charity is the old English word for inclusive love.\nThis is a moment in our shared humanity when we don\u2019t know what happens next, but I suspect that we will need more than just an economic stimulus; we will need a stimulus in civility, in community and in charity that can only be generated from within, as we lament and then renew ourselves together.\nIn the words of Adam Lindsay Gordon, the 19th century maverick Australian poet and politician: \u201cLife is mostly froth and bubble, Two things stand like stone. Kindness in another\u2019s trouble, Courage in your own.\u201d\nThese will be the saddest of times, but when it passes we will have the chance to rebuild our world on the charity in all of us.\n\u00a0Join Tim Costello as he gives the inaugural Australia at Home lunchtime briefing at 1pm Monday",

If we stop, then all of our efforts will be wasted and we could potentially see a second peak.\u201d\nThe public have been asked to stop all non-essential travel, work from home if at all possible and limit exercise to one walk outside a day.\n\u201cWe need to keep that lid on and then gradually we will be able to hopefully adjust some of the social distancing measures and gradually get us all back to normal,\u201d Harries said.\n\u201cSo I think three weeks for review. Two or three months to see whether we\u2019ve really squashed it, with about three to six months ideally, and lots of uncertainty in that, but then to see at which point we can actually get back to normal. It is plausible that it could go further than that.\u201d\nThe daily press conference was led by the secretary of state for housing, communities and local government, Robert Jenrick, who said the restrictions would be reviewed at Easter.\nBoris Johnson is still in isolation in No 11 Downing Street after testing positive for coronavirus.\nThe likelihood of long-term government restrictions to try to limit the outbreak comes as Prof Neil Ferguson of Imperial College London, one of the epidemiologists advising the government, told the Sunday Times the lockdown would need to last for months.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to keep these measures in place, in my view, for a significant period of time, probably until the end of May, maybe even early June. May is optimistic,\u201d he said.\nAs of Sunday, 127,737 people had been tested for coronavirus in the UK, of whom 19,522 have tested positive, with 1,228 deaths.\nJenrick also updated the public on the roll-out of food parcels for the most vulnerable groups who have been asked to shield themselves at home for 12 weeks.\nAround 50,000 packages will be delivered by the end of the week to those who have no support. Medication will also be dropped off at people\u2019s homes.\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have family, friends or neighbours nearby, the NHS will deliver your medicines through the community pharmacy network,\u201d Jenrick said. By \u201cletting us know that you need support, then we will deliver food and supplies to your doorstep\u201d.",

One Sunday she came down in great anticipation because it was her turn, only to find her father, just home on leave, eating her egg.

But the exclusion of those who have become self-employed since the end of the 2018-19 tax year is disappointing. It can hardly have escaped the chancellor\u2019s attention that the 2019-20 tax year ends on 5 April \u2013 nearly two months before the scheme is expected to begin paying out. So why can\u2019t the recently self-employed be assessed pro rata on the basis of a promptly submitted 2019-20 tax return? Likewise, I hope that assessment of those who became self-employed in 2018-19 will take account of the date on which their self-employment commenced, rather than assuming their earnings for that year represent a whole year\u2019s income.Rob SykesOxford\n It seems the chancellor\u2019s support for those suffering as a result of the coronavirus pandemic only goes so far. Those recently entering self-employment can apparently go swing. I started self-employment in April 2019 after 44 years of paid (and taxed) employment. As a result I am one of very few people who will not benefit from any grant or help that the government is offering.\nAt the same time I started self-employment, my wife decided to give up her reasonably paid position to work in a care home on minimum wage. We were confident my income would support us until retirement. My wife\u2019s low income also means no universal credit either. I have lost all my work and income, and the chancellor doesn\u2019t care because there would be a risk of fraud, and yet I will shortly submit my tax return for the year ending 5 April 2020 and subsequently pay tax.Paul ChapmanBeyton, Suffolk\n In 1996, I wrote a pamphlet for the Institute of Employment Rights. It was called Towards the Insecurity Society. It showed how a scourge of self-employment had exploded in the construction industry in the UK. Relieving employers of payment of national insurance, and with lower rates of tax and insurance for the self-employed, a powerful fiscal drive pushed millions of building workers into false self-employment.\nWorkers were given no option but to be self-employed: no employment rights, no security, no safety training, no apprenticeships, no pensions. Most were working for the same contractors, under their instruction, using their capital equipment. It was, and is, mass bogus self-employment, infecting most large building sites. I predicted that this fiscal regime would equally drive bogus self-employment into other sectors of the economy. But I could never have foreseen just how widespread this problem would become.\nMore recently, I calculated that this fiscal driver cost the Treasury at least \u00a31.5bn a year in lost national insurance and taxation, just for the construction industry, never mind other sectors. Now this bogus self-employment epidemic has collided with the coronavirus epidemic. Millions of self-employed find themselves threatened with the abyss of no financial protection. The fiscal and legal regime created a situation in which the Treasury was losing billions each year. Now the Treasury is being asked to bail out the bottomless pit of which it was the architect.\nIf there could be a silver lining to this crisis, the underlying epidemic of bogus self-employment and the vulnerability it has created needs to be suppressed. Not by any vaccine, but by the justice of good law and equitable tax regimes.Emeritus Professor Mark HarveyUniversity of Essex",

And that\u2019s where you need to be concerned about extremists exploiting legitimate concerns.\n\u201cDisaffected English nationalists were manifesting themselves at the extremes in things like the British National party and National Action, which fed the undertone that articulated itself as extreme rightwing terrorism.\u201d\nHowever, the crossbench peer warned that it remained to be seen whether potential far-right supporters would be wholly satisfied by Johnson\u2019s administration.\n\u201cAttention still needs to be paid to this group, as it is not clear that they will feel entirely assuaged as a result of the fact that people are paying wider attention to them now. Terrorist problems emerge when you have a significant population who feel alienated and nobody takes notice of them, causing frustration and anger,\u201d he added.\nEvans, who was made a life peer in 2014, made the comments in an interview with the US-based Combat Terrorism Center. He has previously said the rise of far-right terrorism in Britain has been encouraged by years of austerity following the 2008 recession.\n\u201cI suspect it is a reflection of the social pressures on communities as a result of austerity measures. There seems to be a constituency of disaffected males (for the most part, but not entirely) who find extreme rightwing beliefs attractive. And they have started to get their acts together to organise into groups and plot.\u201d\nIn the interview, he said some far-right terrorists had been \u201cconsciously and deliberately inspired by the perceived success of violent Islamists\u201d.\nHe added that the EDL was \u201cmutually symbiotic\u201d with Anjem Choudary\u2019s al-Muhajiroun group and described the emergence of neo-Nazi terrorist organisation National Action and its successor groups, which have described their ideology as \u201cwhite jihad\u201d, as predictable.\nHe added: \u201cThere is some evidence that they have been consciously and deliberately inspired by the perceived success of the violent Islamists in getting their grievances on the table as a result of violence and thought, \u2018Well, we can do something like that.\u2019\u201d\nLast September the head of counterterror police, Neil Basu, vowed to thwart the rise of the far right, which the force has said is the fastest-growing terrorist threat in the UK.\nThe number of white terror suspects being arrested in the UK has outstripped those of Asian background for two years in a row, and of the 25 attack plots that have been foiled since March 2017, 16 were Islamist, eight far right and one \u201cother\u201d.\nIn 2018 MI5 took the lead in investigating the most dangerous extreme rightwing terrorists in a sign of how seriously the threat was being taken.\nSome terrorists were incited by extreme rightwing propaganda, such as Thomas Mair, who murdered the MP Jo Cox in 2016. But others, like Darren Osborne, who attacked Muslim worshippers with a van in north London, had acted after reading lawful material from groups such as the EDL and mainstream media.",

        "content": "The former Open champion, whose coach has tested positive for coronavirus, understands it may be some time before he is back on the course\nAs Henrik Stenson spent Thursday evening on the Sawgrass range, the frustrations of a 74 to begin the Players Championship dominating his thoughts, he knew nothing of impending shutdown. The PGA Tour\u2019s flagship event lasted 18 holes on 12 March, with coronavirus sharply halting golf at the top level. Stenson has not had any notion to strike a ball since.\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel the rush to practise and play,\u201d the Swede says. \u201cFive weeks out is when I\u2019ll start digging in hard because I\u2019ll have something on the horizon. I want to be ready and prepared when we get the go-ahead because this is going to impact so many things in this sport.\u201d\nBut out from when? The Masters is postponed, as is the US PGA Championship. The staging of the US Open in June remains a long-shot and the Open a month later is shrouded in doubt.\n\u201cOnce we started the Players I expected us to finish but everything happened so quickly,\u201d Stenson says. \u201cYou only need one person to be sick at a tournament and you have all sorts of implications. I have no issues at all with the decision.\n\u201cIf I am going to find some small positive, I have to go back to 2003-2004 for the last time I had a nine-10 week off season. This one is obviously not intended but I have to try to use the time as best I can. I\u2019ll focus on workouts and doing some fun stuff you don\u2019t get to do otherwise; cleaning the garage, cleaning closets. There\u2019s always things to do and things to accomplish, right?\u201d\nStenson cherished golf\u2019s return to the Olympic scene as he collected silver in Rio. If postponement of the Tokyo Games was inevitable, it still stung the 43-year-old.\n\u201cBoth as an experience but also as my last chance to get another or a better medal,\u201d he says. \u201cThe Olympics and Ryder Cup were highlights looking at 2020.\u201d\nAt least the Olympic scenario is relatively clear cut. \u201cI have played two full tournaments in the PGA Tour season so what about the FedEx Cup and qualifying for the play-offs?\u201d Stenson asks. \u201cSome guys have played 15 events. How do you tackle all that if you start playing in June or July? I am exempt through next year on the PGA Tour, so it doesn\u2019t really matter for playing privileges, but for some guys that\u2019s a big thing.\u201d\nCould the Ryder Cup become the sole domain of picks? \u201cNo matter what you do there, it\u2019s going to be unfair to some. Tyrrell Hatton who won in Turkey and won at Bay Hill. Can you go to picks and \u2013 this is hypothetical, clearly \u2013 a captain feels he doesn\u2019t fit into the 12? Someone could go from a lock to not in the team.\u201d\nStenson is a former Open champion, a past recipient of the FedEx Cup\u2019s $10m bonus and a Ryder Cup stalwart. It is something of cliche to suggest sportspeople of his level are out of touch with reality and, in Stenson\u2019s case, completely unfair. He acknowledges the gravity of this pandemic.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of fun stuff available for the kids and for us here [at the family home in Florida] but I\u2019m not sure I should mention that when you have someone locked in an apartment and can\u2019t go outside,\u201d Stenson says. \u201cIt\u2019s disastrous on a global level from people being really sick to losing their lives, to the world economy plummeting. Anyone who lives paycheque to paycheque is going to feel this. Everyone will to a degree but it feels corny if I am going to complain when people are losing their jobs.\n\u201cThey say you might have no or very mild symptoms but who wants to roll the dice on that? I\u2019ve had normal flu three times and felt like garbage by a multiple of 10. Once was before the 2014 Masters, I was in bed for nine days with a high fever. On a hot first day at Augusta, I almost fell into Rae\u2019s Creek walking off the 13th green. My caddie had to steer me by the arm towards the tee. Another time I was in an emergency room, convinced I was going to die. If you can feel even worse from this, it won\u2019t be a fun ride at all. People are in grave danger. This is nasty.\u201d\nStenson\u2019s coach, Pete Cowen, tested positive after returning from the Players. \u201cHe picked it up on his travels, from what I understand,\u201d Stenson says. \u201cI hope and believe he wasn\u2019t contagious when I last saw him. I think he will get through it but he has been feeling pretty bad.\u201d\nThat Rory McIlroy, Brooks Koepka and Jon Rahm have dismissed the breakaway Premier Golf League spells the end to some but Stenson suggests tales of PGL\u2019s demise are premature.\n\u201cThey are still here, trying to make what they believe is the best product for golf,\u201d he says. \u201cFor as long as I can remember, people complain the fields aren\u2019t strong enough. You can\u2019t have the top 30 guys on each tour playing 44 times in a year, it just isn\u2019t doable.\n\u201cThere are a number of things I like about this concept, one is the best players competing against each other on a much more regular basis. I also think golf would really benefit from a proper off-season, without feeling when you have your own time off that you are missing out because others are playing.\n\u201cWhether we end up there in the short-term or long-term I couldn\u2019t tell you but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we end up there at one point.\u201d",

I\u2019m saying that.\u201d\nThe Sunday political talkshows resonated with alarming news about the scale and spread of the outbreak. Dr Anthony Fauci, Trump\u2019s top public health adviser in the crisis, was pressed by CNN into estimating the extent of Covid-19 in the US before the disease passes.\nFauci began by saying scientists had no firm idea. But then he gave some startling projections. There would be \u201cmillions of cases\u201d and the death toll would probably fall between 100,000 and 200,000, he said.\nFauci also underlined the \u201cserious problem\u201d now unfolding in New York City, which he revealed was seeing 56% of all new infections in the country.\n\u201cThat\u2019s terrible suffering for the people of New York,\u201d Fauci said. \u201cI feel that personally as a New Yorker.\u201d\nPelosi indicated that an investigation of Trump\u2019s actions would be pursued once the worst of the disaster was over.\n\u201cWhat did he know?\u201d she asked, echoing congressional investigators who brought down Richard Nixon. \u201cWhen did he know it?\u201d\nFor now, she said, it was a question of making sure the president stopped failing to act.\n\u201cWe still don\u2019t have adequate testing,\u201d Pelosi said, \u201cand we still don\u2019t have protective equipment for our health workers who are risking their own lives to save lives.\u201d\nPelosi\u2019s accusation seemed certain to inflame Trump, who was due to host a press briefing later on Sunday. Underlining the dysfunction at the core of the federal response to the crisis, the speaker essentially confirmed that she had not spoken with Trump in five months.\nAsked if that were true, Pelosi replied that the crisis \u201chas not required any conversations with the president\u201d.\nThe ties between the White House and individual state governors who are shouldering much of the burden have also descended into dysfunction. Trump has been openly scathing of several Democrats on the frontlines of the fight against the pandemic, bragging on Friday that he refused even to talk to the leaders of Michigan and Washington \u2013 states very badly hit.\nOn Saturday, Trump also picked a fight with New York when he announced he was mulling an \u201cenforceable quarantine\u201d \u2013 a position which revealed the disconnect between his and Governor Andrew Cuomo\u2019s efforts to thwart the coronavirus outbreak.\nTrump backed down. But at a news briefing on Sunday, Cuomo said: \u201cPeople are so on edge, it really panicked people.\u201d\nFederal health officials later issued an advisory urging New York, New Jersey and Connecticut residents to refrain from non-essential domestic travel for two weeks.\nCuomo also announced an extension of the stay-at-home order for all non-essential workers until 15 April. That carries the New York lockdown beyond 12 April, Easter, on which Trump has indicated he wants to begin reopening the US economy.\nThere is no end in sight for New York\u2019s woes. Cuomo announced on Sunday that the state had confirmed more than 59,000 Covid-19 cases, of whom 8,500 were currently hospitalized and some 2,000 in intensive care.\nThe death toll in New York City stood at 672. Statewide it was 965, up 237 on the day before.\nWith New York yet to reach the peak of its Covid-19 curve, other US cities are fast moving into the danger zone. In Louisiana, which has the second highest per-capita death rate in the country, Governor John Bel Edwards reiterated on Sunday his expectation that ventilators would run out in New Orleans within a week. \n  More than 150 people have died in the state, according to its department of public health, many in New Orleans. More than 1,100 people have been hospitalized, a third needing ventilators.\nEdwards told CBS\u2019s Face the Nation his state had received no ventilators from the national stockpile, run by the Trump administration, and had placed orders for around 12,000 with private manufacturers. It has received only 192.\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing everything that we can,\u201d Edwards said.\nDetroit, Michigan, is also hurtling towards becoming a major disaster area. By Sunday there had been more than 2,000 confirmed cases in the city and 46 deaths.\nGretchen Whitmer, governor of Michigan, told CNN Detroit was in a dire situation that was \u201cgetting worse by the minute\u201d. Like many other governors she has been frustrated by the slow response of the federal government in providing ventilators and essential protective gear for frontline medical workers.\nTrump has responded to her appeals for help by denigrating her as \u201cthe woman from Michigan\u201d and by recounting publicly how he advised the vice-president, Mike Pence, not to talk to her. She refused to rise to the bait, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t have the energy to respond to every slight.\u201d\nCoronavirus continues to overshadow the battle for the Democratic presidential nomination, between Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders. Biden appeared on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press on Sunday and cautioned against raising \u201cfalse expectations\u201d \u2013 a clear reference to Trump\u2019s much-vaunted ambition to reopen parts of the country.\n\u201cThe American people have never shied away from being able to deal with the truth,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThe worst thing you can do is raise false expectations and then watch them get dashed \u2013 then, they begin to lose confidence in their leadership.\u201d",

Government-owned LNER also runs a service between London and Hull, after a joint venture between Stagecoach and Virgin Group was stripped of the franchise.\nAs one of three such firms in the country, Hull Trains has not been offered additional financial support from the government, which franchised rail operators have.\nLouise Cheeseman, the managing director of Hull Trains, said that suspending services was a difficult decision but it would help keep the business alive.\n\u201cWe have explored every avenue to try to keep trains running but sadly it is not currently financially viable to run our services,\u201d she said, adding that the company will resume services as soon as it can.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a very difficult week for the business but the reluctant decision to temporarily suspend services is the right one based on the current unprecedented circumstances and I hope our passengers understand this.\n\u201cThe move protects the long-term future of Hull Trains and our people\u2019s jobs, which is important as it will allow us to reinstate operations quickly when possible.\u201d\n Mick Cash, the general secretary of transport union RMT, said: \u201cThis decision affects 130 rail staff around the Hull area and they must be treated as an absolute priority.\n\u201cWe expect the company and the government to guarantee wages at 100% and not some reduced rate and we also expect jobs, service, pensions and conditions for these rail staff to be fully protected throughout this crisis.\n\u201cWe will be in direct talks to secure our members the guarantees they are entitled to. The government has given the rail companies financial assurances and the same must apply to staff.\u201d",

        "content": "About 2,100 migrants in northern France are fearful of being dispersed to new centres\nUp to 2,100 refugees in Calais and Dunkirk are facing an imminent coronavirus lockdown by French authorities, with many saying they will try to reach the UK rather than go to accommodation centres if their camps are cleared.\nBuses will be sent to the camps to transfer refugees to centres housing up to 100 people from Tuesday. The transfers are said to be voluntary but some of the refugees told the Guardian that they distrust the police and are fearful of being forced into the centres, so plan to run away and continue in their attempts to cross the Channel.\nWhy did\nCalais\nbecome a\nstaging post?\nRefugees have been gathering in Calais on their way to the UK for decades. Periodically the French authorities attempt to prevent them from coming but asylum seekers continue to arrive. Some pay people-smugglers to get them into lorries parked near the port while those who have no money try to conceal themselves in moving trucks.\u00a0\nWho travels\nto camps on\nthe Channel?\n\nMany asylum seekers have relatives or friends in the\nUK or have some level of English language skills. But\nthe 1,000 or so refugees currently living in Calais and\nDunkirk represent a very small proportion of refugees\nseeking asylum across Europe.\nAlthough the situation in Northern France attracts\nattention because it is at the UK border, the numbers\ngathered here are tiny compared with the 100,000-\nplus who arrived in Europe in 2017, the vast majority of\nwhom intend to claim asylum elsewhere in Europe.\nWhat are\npoliticians\ndoing to\nchange the\nsituation?\nThe British government contributed to a \u00a317m joint Anglo-French\npackage of security\nmeasures, including the\nconstruction of a 1km-long\nconcrete wall, aimed at\npreventing asylum seekers\nfrom getting close lorries arriving at the port.\nBut charities say extra security does not\nprevent the arrival of new\nrefugees.\nThey want the British\ngovernment to make it easier for vulnerable\nunaccompanied children to\ntravel legally and for France\nto accept that there will\nalways be some refugees\nin Calais, and provide\ndignified reception\ncentres.\nConditions in the camps are worsening, with shortages of food, water and showers as NGOs are forced to pull out because of the coronavirus pandemic, although no cases of Covid-19 have been reported in the camps.\nMany refugees \u2013 mostly from Afghanistan, Eritrea, Iran, Iraq and Sudan \u2013 often make repeated attempts to cross to the UK. Last year, 1,900 reached the UK by boat, with many others arriving by lorry. Eighty migrants are understood to have reached the UK by boat last week, with some reports of around 160 attempts in one day.\nWhile numbers are disputed, internal documents collated by NGOs in the area and seen by the Guardian revealed there are about 1,500 people in Calais, including 160 unaccompanied children, the youngest of whom is 11. There are about 600 people in Grand Synthe in Dunkirk, including around 35 families. Some have serious health problems such as diabetes, and others have suffered broken limbs including a broken arm and a broken jaw.\nA 16-year-old boy from Sudan told the Guardian that he planned to run away and cross the Channel rather than go into one of the French centres. \u201cIf we are taken away to these centres we won\u2019t know what will happen to us,\u201d he said. \u201cI will run away and I will keep trying to reach the UK by lorry. In the camps we are more spread out but if we go into the centres we could be closer together so more at risk.\u201d\nThe World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.\nThe UN agency\u00a0advises\u00a0people to:\nMany countries are now enforcing or recommending curfews or lockdowns. Check with your local authorities for up-to-date information about the situation in your area.\u00a0\nIn the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should\u00a0stay at home for at least 7 days.\nIf you live with other people,\u00a0they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.\nHe said that catching Covid-19 was not uppermost in the minds of the refugees. \u201cWe are thinking more about our survival,\u201d he said.\nMany NGOs, which provide food and other support to refugees in the camps, have pulled out because of the pandemic. Refugees have reported food and water shortages. French authorities are distributing bottled water but it is understood they are concerned that too many water points in the camps will hinder physical distancing. Provision of showers and phone charging facilities have also decreased.\nNGOs working in the camps in Calais say it is crucial that the lockdown is managed properly and that the French authorities work with them, as they are trusted by the refugees.\nClare Moseley, founder of Care4Calais, which provides emergency aid and support for refugees in Calais and Dunkirk as well as in Brussels, and is continuing to operate in the refugee areas, said: \u201cWe haven\u2019t had any confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the camps. The refugees are more focused on survival than on the virus. We don\u2019t know how \u2018voluntary\u2019 the accommodation centres will be.\n\u201cFood supplies in the camps have reduced significantly and if it\u2019s the only way people can get food, they may feel forced to go. The reduction of food in the camps has been a game-changer. If the only way people can eat is by going into one of the centres then it won\u2019t really be voluntary.\u201d\nShe said that after getting legal advice from lawyers in the UK and France, Care4Calais volunteers are continuing to operate as frontline aid workers and are following current World Health Organization guidance on infection control.\nAccording to documents seen by the Guardian, some unaccompanied minors have reported being beaten by French police and they have told charity workers they prefer to sleep in the camps rather than in centres provided by the French authorities.\nWhen buses are sent to the camps from Tuesday, migrants who agree to leave will be given a medical check before being transferred. Once they reach the temporary accommodation they will be expected to keep the same lockdown rules as the rest of France, which has prohibited all movement except for essential work, essential shopping, medical appointments and a daily maximum one-hour exercise routine not more than 1km from home.\nEven before the coronavirus crisis, life in the refugee camps was grim. Volunteers said that asking migrants who were often four or five to a tent to maintain social distancing was impossible.\nL\u00e9ah Njeim, a volunteer with Utopia 56, an organisation that distributes food to the camps, told Ouest France: \u201cSome migrants are more than an hour\u2019s walk away from running water.\u201d\nUtopia 56 had been transporting sick migrants to local health centres. \u201cWe\u2019ve had to stop this ... the police are blocking the exit to the Jungle [camp],\u201d Njeim added.\nSecours Catholique, a charity that ran a day centre for 250 to 300 migrants where they could warm up, have a hot drink and charge their mobiles, said it had been forced to close as most of its volunteers were aged over 70 and in the coronavirus \u201cat risk\u201d group. In an open letter to the authorities, 18 NGOs called for the migrants who wished to stay in the Channel area to be housed in \u201chotels, schools and empty apartments\u201d.\n\u201cTo stay home, you have to have a home to stay in,\u201d the organisations wrote in the petition addressed to the French prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe.\nFran\u00e7ois Guennoc, vice-president of the Auberge des Migrants, told La Voix du Nord newspaper: \u201cGiving them accommodation far away will not work. Some will not get in the buses and there will be people who return soon afterwards.\u201d\nSources close to the French government told the Guardian that health protection and sheltering arrangements for refugees in the camps were under way.",

        "content": "Passengers on cruise liner where four died and its sister ship hope to be flying home soon\nHundreds of passengers, many of them British, on a coronavirus-stricken cruise trip where four people have died are confined to their cabins awaiting the go-ahead to pass through the Panama Canal.\nDozens have fallen ill on the Zaandam cruise ship, which was stranded off the Pacific coast of Panama after several Latin American countries refused to let it into port. Some passengers were transferred to a second ship \u2013 the Rotterdam \u2013 on Saturday night.\nNegotiations are continuing for final permission to be granted for the two cruise ships carrying more than 1,500 passengers and crew to pass through the canal on their way to Florida, where they hope to be given permission to dock.\nA decision made to stop them travelling through the canal was reversed on Saturday evening by the Panamanian government for \u201chumanitarian reasons\u201d. However, on Sunday passengers on the Rotterdam received a message from the captain saying they were working with the Panamanian authorities to finalise things and that it was \u201ca fluid situation\u201d.\nOnce they dock in Florida, Britons on board will still have try to fly home. The UK government is urging citizens on broad to try to get commercial flights where possible.\nThe housing secretary, Robert Jenrick, said the government did not rule out repatriation fights and one such mission was under way to bring back British people in Peru, but added that it is still possible to fly home from many countries. He said: \u201cIf we need to do more steps of that kind in the days ahead, then we will of course do so. We want to get those British citizens back safely to the UK.\u201d\nUp to 1,000 British nationals stranded in Peru were being repatriated by the UK Foreign Office on Sunday.\nThe British ambassador to Peru, Kate Harrisson, confirmed on Twitter that one British Airways flight was full on departure and that a second BA flight chartered by Ireland was due to take off.\n\u201cThis today will be our third flight leaving Peru for the UK \u2013 two flights chartered by the UK, one flight chartered by Ireland \u2013 and tomorrow we\u2019ll have two more flights flying back from Lima to London, bringing British nationals back to the UK to their friends and families,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWhile we\u2019re very happy to be going home, we are mindful that there are still Brits in Peru who need repatriating,\u201d said passenger Ellie Harper, 32, who had been stranded in Huacachina, a desert oasis five hours from the Peruvian capital.\nNine Britons and one Irish citizen who were staying in the Pariwana hostel have been prevented from joining the repatriation flights. Peruvian health authorities say they must remain under quarantine for up to three months along with 140 fellow guests after two tested positive for Covid-19.\n\u201cWe were then treated like we were going to get on a flight today to then find out five hours before we could be here indefinitely,\u201d Si\u00e2n Forkan, one of the British guests, told the Guardian.\nThe foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, has reportedly been talking to other foreign ministries over the weekend to try to resolve other cases of British people struggling to return.\nHe is understood to be making an announcement on Monday of a significant financial package to bring people back, which may include organising flights to Nepal and New Zealand, and using RAF Voyager planes, which can carry some 290 people, as part of the transport.\nThe Zaandam set sail from Buenos Aires on 7 March with 1,243 guests and 586 crew on board, and was originally scheduled to end its voyage in Chile on 21 March. The crew had hoped they could disembark in Punta Arenas, Chile, for flights, but were not allowed to do so. Apart from the transfer to the Rotterdam, no one has left the ship since 14 March. It is thought there are about 220 British tourists on the cruise.\nA retired British infection control nurse, Sara Fletcher, 64, who has recently completed cancer treatment, is among the passengers transferred to the Rotterdam. She said that when the lockdown began a week ago after some passengers and crew reported experiencing influenza-like symptoms, passengers received excellent care and attention from the crew. However, on Friday passengers were told that four people had died.\nShe said conditions on the Rotterdam were very strict. \u201cThe atmosphere here is totally different,\u201d she said. \u201cThe transfer from one ship to another was a well-ordered and socially distanced process \u2026 There is a great sense of fear on the ship. We had two barked messages to stay in our rooms at all times, not to go in the corridor, and not to open our door unless someone knocked.\n\u201cThey knock when they leave something then move away before we open. We have been isolated now for a week and not off the ship for two weeks. I think we\u2019re going to be kept on lockdown for the duration.\u201d She said she did not even think that controlled walking on deck would be permitted.\nJo Randle\u2019s 72-year-old mother and 71-year-old father, from Watford, are on the Zaandam. She said they were coping as best they could but were desperate for some fresh air and exercise. \u201cThey don\u2019t have any underlying health problems, but being confined to their cabin is taking a physical toll.\u201d\nA Foreign Office spokesperson said: \u201cWe are doing all we can to help British people on board the Zaandam cruise ship. Our staff are in close contact with the cruise operator and the authorities in the region to ensure British people can get home safely.\u201d\nThe operator, Holland America Line, said on Saturday night: \u201cWe are aware of reported permission for both Zaandam and Rotterdam to transit the Panama Canal in the near future. We greatly appreciate this consideration in the humanitarian interest of our guests and crew. This remains a dynamic situation, and we continue to work with the Panamanian authorities to finalise details.\u201d",

        "content": "Concern is growing among health workers that they risk contracting and spreading coronavirus\nThe deaths of the first British doctors from Covid-19 have intensified pressure on ministers to accelerate the supply of protective equipment and address growing fears among frontline staff that they risk catching and spreading coronavirus.\nAs the UK\u2019s death toll from the virus rose to 1,228 over the weekend, two surgeons were confirmed to have died in what the NHS medical director described as \u201ca stark reminder to the whole country that we all must take this crisis seriously\u201d.\nAmged El-Hawrani, a 55-year-old ear, nose and throat consultant, died on Saturday at Leicester Royal Infirmary, while Adil El Tayar, 63, an organ transplant specialist, died on Wednesday at West Middlesex University Hospital in London, it emerged. Both had contracted Covid-19.\nAs they mourned the death of their colleagues, doctors\u2019 and nurses\u2019 groups attacked continuing shortages of protective equipment \u2013 from masks to gowns \u2013 and complained that there was still confusion despite fresh official guidance about their proper use. There were further calls to ramp up testing of NHS workers.\nJenny Harries, deputy chief medical officer, said fatalities were expected to increase. With Britain beginning its second full week under effective lockdown, she indicated that normal life was not likely to resume for three to six months \u2013 and \u201cit is plausible it could go further than that\u201d, she cautioned.\nOn Monday, the public was asked to stop all non-essential travel, work from home if possible, and limit exercise to once a day, with a ban of gatherings of more than two people. All pubs, restaurants, cafes, cinemas and gyms have been told to close.\nHarries said: \u201cOver time \u2013 probably over the next six months \u2013 we will have a three-week review, we will see where we\u2019re going. We need to keep that lid on and then gradually we will be able to hopefully adjust some of the social distancing measures and gradually get us all back to normal.\n\u201cSo I think three weeks for review. Two or three months to see whether we\u2019ve really squashed it, with about three to six months ideally, and lots of uncertainty in that, but then to see at which point we can actually get back to normal. It is plausible that it could go further than that.\u201d\nHarries described El-Hawrani\u2019s death as \u201ca worrying event\u201d, adding: \u201cIt is in no one\u2019s interests that we lose our colleagues.\u201d Stephen Powis, NHS national medical director, said his death was \u201cnot just an individual human tragedy, but a stark reminder to the whole country that we all must take this crisis seriously\u201d. Pradeep Kumar, a surgeon, said he was angry at the loss of his friend. \u201cDid it have to be this way?\u201d he said. \u201cSuch a waste of precious life.\u201d\nTayar had spent his final days volunteering to stem the outbreak in an A&E department in the Midlands. \u201cHe wanted to be deployed where he would be most useful in the crisis,\u201d his cousin, British-Sudanese journalist Zeinab Badawi, said.\nSymptoms are defined by the NHS as either:\nNHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should\u00a0stay at home for at least 7 days.\nIf you live with other people,\u00a0they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.\nAfter 14 days, anyone you live with who does not have symptoms can return to their normal routine. But, if anyone in your home gets symptoms, they should stay at home for 7 days from the day their symptoms start.\u00a0Even if it means they're at home for longer than 14 days.\nIf you live with someone who is 70 or over, has a long-term condition, is pregnant or has a weakened immune system, try to find somewhere else for them to stay for 14 days.\nIf you have to stay at home together, try to keep away from each other as much as possible.\nAfter 7 days, if you no longer have a high temperature you can return to your normal routine.\nIf you still have a high temperature, stay at home until your temperature returns to normal.\nIf you still have a cough after 7 days, but your temperature is normal, you do not need to continue staying at home. A cough can last for several weeks after the infection has gone.\nStaying at home means you should:\nYou can use your garden, if you have one. You can also leave the house to exercise \u2013 but stay at least 2 metres away from other people.\nIf you have symptoms of coronavirus, use the\u00a0NHS 111 coronavirus service\u00a0to find out what to do.\nSource:\u00a0NHS England\u00a0on 23 March 2020\nBoris Johnson, who continues to suffer \u201cmild symptoms\u201d of Covid-19, released a video on Sunday night announcing that 20,000 former NHS workers had returned to the frontline, up from 7,500 on Monday.\nAt least 2,660 doctors have heeded the call to return from retirement to fight the pandemic, but hundreds have warned that they will not do so or increase their hours unless they are guaranteed proper compensation if they die, the Guardian has learned.\nThe families of doctors who leave the NHS pension scheme are not normally paid death-in-service compensation, which is worth over two years\u2019 salary. The department of health and social care said it was \u201cconsidering proposals to offer further support for those returning to the frontline\u201d.\nWith supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE) becoming the key concern for frontline health workers, Robert Jenrick, the communities secretary, insisted that he understood the urgent need for protection.\nAt the the daily government press conference, he said over 200m items of protective kit had been delivered so far, including 170m masks, 42.8m gloves, 13.7m aprons, 2.3m pairs of eye protectors and 182,000 gowns to 58,000 \u201chealthcare settings\u201d, including hospitals and GP surgeries.\nAddressing \u201call those who rely on this equipment, and their families and loved ones\u201d, Jenrick said: \u201cWe will not stop until we have got you the equipment you need.\u201d\nNHS England and Public Health England (PHE) have acknowledged there had been distribution and supply problems. In a letter sent on Saturday to hospitals, GPs and commissioning bodies, their leaders said they were \u201cnow confident that all logistical issues are being solved and that every part of the NHS that needs PPE will be supplied in good time with adequate stock\u201d.\nBut Chaand Nagpaul, chair of the British Medical Association council, said: \u201cThe reality is that [PPE is] still not reaching hundreds, if not thousands, of frontline staff on the ground \u2013 with current reports from around the country from doctors that supplies are running out, being rationed or of inadequate protection.\n\u201cWe already have many doctors telling us that they\u2019re extremely concerned that they feel the level of PPE that they currently have is not adequate to protect themselves and their colleagues against Covid-19 \u2026 Doctors here will understandably be concerned when they see images in the media of their colleagues around the world treating patients in full overalls and full face protection, and asking why the same is not recommended or available here.\u201d\nGuidance issued over the weekend by NHS England and PHE about how the equipment should be used also diverges from World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, doctors said. It instructs frontline workers to use goggles in procedures most likely to generate virus-carrying aerosols, such as inserting a breathing tube.\nIt states that aprons rather than disposable full-sleeve gowns can be worn in other cases. The British Medical Association said this differs from WHO guidance on gowns and goggles for all healthcare workers dealing with suspected or confirmed coronavirus cases.\nNurses said the latest official guidance about personal protection \u201clacks any credibility\u201d. \u201cEvery minute we wait for new guidance is a minute too long,\u201d said Dame Donna Kinnair, Royal College of Nursing general secretary. \u201cThe confusion must stop. We need action.\u201d\nNHS England said it was reviewing the guidance and would issue new instructions on what equipment to wear in what circumstances in the coming days.\nDr Claudia Paoloni, president of HCSA, the hospital doctors\u2019 union, said there was no \u201cluxury of days\u201d. \u201cRoyal Colleges have been taking matters into their own hands with reinterpretations of the guidance, which is causing confusion and contradiction on the ground,\u201d she said. \u201cSome trusts have broken ranks and rightly introduced more stringent measures. The rate at which the disease is progressing means the government and PHE need to get on top of this, and quickly.\u201d\nTwo hundred and nine fatalities from coronavirus were announced in the UK on Sunday. The increase was smaller than feared, but health experts cautioned against seeing any glimmer of hope.\nThe Department for Health and Social Care announced that 19,522 people had tested positive for the disease in the UK, following another 6,961 tests in the last day. That testing rate is short of the 10,000 tests the government has promised and well short of the 25,000 tests a day that Boris Johnson promised.\nThe former prime minister Tony Blair joined the former health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, in calling for ramping up testing for the virus. Speaking on Sky News, Blair said: \u201cIt is all about getting to mass testing as fast as possible, because we have to know who has the disease and who has had the disease in order to get the lockdown eased and get people back to work.\u201d",

The nation thanks you and your families for your service and sacrifice. We love you!\u201d\nOn Twitter on Sunday, Trump\u2019s message to veterans met with a mix of thanks and severe scorn, given his track record regarding the Vietnam war.\nTrump instituted the official holiday in 2017. Now 73, he was of age to be drafted for a war in which fighting reached a ferocious peak in the late 1960s and 58,000 Americans were killed. He did not serve in any capacity.\nTrump received five deferments from service, four academic and one on dubious medical grounds.\nIn 2015, as he ran for president, Trump said he could not remember which of his heels had been temporarily affected by bone spurs, calcium buildups which might render a recruit unfit for active service. His campaign said it was both.\nTrump told the New York Times the spurs were \u201cnot a big problem, but it was enough of a problem\u201d.\n\u201cThey were spurs,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, it was difficult from the long-term walking standpoint.\u201d\nDuring the 2016 campaign, Trump was also revealed to have referred to avoiding sexually transmitted diseases as his own \u201cVietnam\u201d.\nNeither revelation derailed Trump\u2019s White House run \u2013 and neither did his public derision of John McCain, a senator and Republican presidential candidate widely revered for his service as a navy pilot and his endurance of five and a half years in brutal conditions in captivity in Vietnam.\nMcCain died in 2018. Though he generally held the moral high ground when attacked by Trump, he did pass telling comment when speaking to C-Span 3\u2019s American History TV in the year before his death.\n\u201cOne aspect of the conflict \u2026 that I will never, ever countenance,\u201d McCain said, \u201cis that we drafted the lowest income level of America and the highest income level found a doctor that would say they had a bone spur.\n\u201cThat is wrong. That is wrong. If we are going to ask every American to serve, every American should serve.\u201d",

        "content": "Monday: Public gatherings limited to two people. Plus, Guardian writers share their hidden gems of online streaming\nGood morning, this is James Murray bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Monday 30 March.\nScott Morrison has announced further restrictions to curb  the spread of coronavirus, including a new limit of two people for outdoor gatherings. In his Sunday evening press conference, the prime minister also told the over-70s to stay at home altogether and said people should only leave the house for essential trips, such as to the supermarket. He closed public areas like playgrounds and placed a six-month moratorium on evictions from rental properties. The death toll in Australia is now at 16, an increase of two in 24 hours, but there was some optimism about the number of recorded cases. Morrison said the daily rate of increase had declined from 25-30% a week ago to as low as 9% on Sunday. The health minister, Greg Hunt, went as far as to say there were \u201cearly signs of flattening of the curve\u201d.\nAustralians who have lost work as a result of the virus will be offered a UK-style wage guarantee but there are fews details yet on how this will work. Federal public servants have finally been told they can now work from home. And there was relief for Australians stranded on a cruise ship in northern Italy, who were told they would be flown to Perth. Those who test positive to Covid-19 will not be allowed on the plane.\nSpain recorded 838 deaths in a 24-hour period on Sunday, bringing the country\u2019s death toll to 6,528, with 78,797 confirmed cases. Fernando Sim\u00f3n, the head of Spain\u2019s centre for health emergencies, said the situation was stabilising but \u201cthe main problem is making sure intensive care units aren\u2019t overloaded\u201d. Deaths in Lombardy, the region in northern Italy hardest hit, look to be slowing down. Meanwhile in Germany, Hesse state\u2019s finance minister, Thomas Sch\u00e4fer, has killed himself. \u201cWe are in shock, we are in disbelief and above all we are immensely sad,\u201d said the state premier, Volker Bouffier. The UK is also in mourning after the death of a consultant doctor from Covid-19. NHS England said Amged el-Hawrani was the first confirmed hospital frontline worker to die after testing positive for coronavirus. The UK has recorded 209 deaths in the last 24 hours, bringing the total number of deaths there to 1,228. The country\u2019s oldest coronavirus victim is Hilda Churchill, 108, from Salford, who survived the Spanish flu in 1918.\nIn Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14. In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255. Other international helplines can be found at www.befrienders.org.\nThe leading US government infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci has predicted coronavirus could kill as many as 200,000 Americans. On Sunday morning the US had recorded nearly 125,000 cases of Covid-19 and 2,188 deaths. The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, told CNN\u2019s State Of The Union: \u201cAs the president fiddles, people are dying.\u201d The US response to the outbreak seems to be falling along partisan lines, with Democratic governors imposing restrictions and Republicans refusing to do the same.\nTreatments for Covid-19 continue to evolve. The NHS is trialling an experimental antibody treatment, where patients are given plasma from people who have survived. The treatment is for people admitted to hospital with pneumonia in the hope it reduces the number who end up on ventilators.\nThe government will check all proposed foreign investments into Australia, amid fears the economic fallout from Covid-19 will make assets vulnerable. As the western world locks down economies, China has made moves to restart its own economic activity, raising concerns that distressed foreign assets could be bought without appropriate checks and balances.\nA 91-year-old woman has died after she and four other people were attacked by three dogs on the NSW south coast. The woman died at the scene after sustaining serious injuries.\n2019 was probably the worst year this century for the environment in Australia. Record heat and drought affected river flows, tree cover and wildlife on an \u201cunprecedented scale\u201d, according to a new report.\nChurch services all over the world have defied Covid-19 lockdowns to hold packed services. While millions worshipped online, dozens of parishioners, many of them elderly, crowded into Kazan Cathedral in St Petersburg to receive communion.\nThe British-Iranian dual national Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe is under consideration for clemency. Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who is serving a five-year jail sentence in Iran, is seen by some as a bargaining chip in a wider diplomatic dispute with the UK.\nNorth Korea fired what appeared to be two short-range ballistic missiles on Sunday. South Korea described the timing as \u201cinappropriate\u201d.\nMichael McGowan reports on the personal toll of the  outbreak.  In Sydney he talks with Jazmin Weatherall, who used to work at a cinema until it had to close down. In Victoria, Bruce Roberts and his partner Cory, both flight attendants, face having no income. \u201cThere\u2019s so many of us with so many questions\u201d he says. In Melbourne, Marlee Jane Ward, a 37-year-old writer and receptionist, says: \u201cMy job that paid the bills was casual so I had no leave entitlements or redundancy. It\u2019s really revealed how fucking tenuous everything was to begin with.\u201d\nBeno\u00eet Jacquot\u2019s 2012 film Farewell, My Queen, follows three days in Versailles on the eve of the French revolution. Now streaming on SBS On Demand, the plot of the French-language film revolves around a servant, Sidonie (L\u00e9a Seydoux), who is the assistant reader to Marie Antoinette (Diane Kruger). Even though we know, thanks to history, where the story ends, Farewell, My Queen still manages to feel like a workplace thriller, with the story focused on the ladies\u2019 maids and palace librarians who wonder if the revolutionaries will want to dispose of them too. It isn\u2019t exactly relaxing, but something about stories of extremely wealthy people not sharing their resources feels essential at this moment.\nAnd a round of applause for the world\u2019s grandparents, doing their duties from self-isolation and using new technology to stay in touch with their grandchildren. \u201cThe last time we had any physical contact was the 14th of March,\u201d says Susan Slaughter from Brisbane. \u201cAll my time was geared around the children but it\u2019s all changed. They\u2019re not allowed into the house any more and so we see them over the fence and on FaceTime.\u201d Daisy Dumas reports on how Australian families are keeping young children apart from their older relatives.\nToday\u2019s Full Story podcast looks at how the Ruby Princess was allowed to disembark at Sydney and spread Covid-19 across Australia. The ship docked on a warm autumn day in Sydney Harbour to let its 2,700 passengers off. Not long afterwards, passenger after passenger was confirmed to have contracted the virus. In this episode of Full Story we look at who was ultimately responsible for a breakdown in Australia\u2019s biosecurity safeguards.\nSorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen $https://audio.guim.co.uk/2020/03/29-25397-FSRUBYPRINCESS.mp3\nFull Story is Guardian Australia\u2019s news podcast.

The Australian describes the situation as \u201cAustralia\u2019s new social order: three\u2019s a crowd\u201d, before going on to report that even the crowds at Bondi seem to be getting the message. The Sydney Morning Herald has a more global look, with its live blog reporting on restrictions in the UK, and the falling death rate in Italy. The West Australian leads with news that the stricken German cruiser Artania would be able to send 29 passengers to the Joondalup health campus, rather than the Hollywood and Bethesda hospitals, where staff said they were not prepared to treat Covid-19 patients.\nIf you would like to receive the Guardian Australia morning mail to your email inbox every weekday,",

He has also said that the Premier League season should be scrapped if it cannot be completed by the end of June.\nThe 26-year-old England captain, contracted until 2024, has previously suggested he could stay with his boyhood club for his entire career but in an Instagram Live chat with Jamie Redknapp he said: \u201cI love Spurs, I\u2019ll always love Spurs but I\u2019ve always said if I don\u2019t feel we\u2019re progressing as a team or going in the right direction, I\u2019m not someone to stay there for the sake of it.\n\u201cI\u2019m an ambitious player, I want to improve, get better and become one of the top, top players. It all depends on what happens as a team and how we progress as a team. So it\u2019s not a definite I\u2019m going to stay there forever, but it\u2019s not a no either.\u201d\nHe talked about life under Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, who replaced Mauricio Pochettino but has struggled to lift a team who were eighth in the Premier League and out of the FA Cup and Champions League when play was suspended. \u201cNext year would be the first chance for the gaffer to have a pre-season, and bed his values into the team. So we\u2019ll see what happens. Of course I want to win trophies, and to do that sooner rather than later.\u201d\nAsked about working with Mourinho, Kane continued: \u201cIt\u2019s been good. What you see is what you get. He\u2019s an honest guy. If he likes you, he\u2019ll tell you; if he doesn\u2019t like you, he\u2019ll tell you. From my point of view I\u2019ve built a good relationship with him.\n\u201cIt\u2019s great to work under a manager like Jos\u00e9 \u2026 I\u2019m excited to see how that relationship unfolds, and I know he\u2019s excited to put his stamp on the team. From a players\u2019 point of view we know we\u2019ve got a top, top manager, so it\u2019s up to us to go out and perform.\u201d\nKane has not played since rupturing a hamstring tendon on 1 January but confirmed he should be ready for action as and when the Premier League returns. The campaign has been suspended until 30 April at the earliest because of the coronavirus pandemic though many top-flight clubs are resigned to the shutdown being extended, with games possibly being played behind closed doors. Kane\u2019s view is that it would be unworkable and impractical for the season to drift into the summer months.\n\u201cI know the Premier League will do everything they can to finish the season and that they are looking at every option possible,\u201d Kane said. \u201cWe do need to try to finish the season but there needs to be a point where enough\u2019s enough. Playing into July or August and pushing next season back, I don\u2019t see too much benefit in that.\n\u201cProbably the limit for me is the end of June. If the season\u2019s not completed by then we need to look at the options and just look forward to next season.\u201d\nKane echoed the opinion of Aleksander Ceferin, the president of Uefa, who warned on Saturday that the season may never be completed if it cannot be restarted by June.\nCeferin said behind-closed-doors games would have to be considered if leagues were to finish across Europe but dismissed the notion of the Champions League or Europa League finals being played without fans present.\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t succeed in restarting, the season will probably be lost,\u201d he told the Italian newspaper La Repubblica. \u201cNobody knows when the pandemic will end. There is a plan A, B and C. The three options are to start again in mid-May, in June or at the end of June. There is also the possibility of starting again at the beginning of the next [season], starting the following one later. We will see the best solution for leagues and clubs.\u201d",

Privately funded security arrangements have been made.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s tweet came just days before the couple are due to officially step down as senior royals on 31 March. \n Buckingham Palace has declined to comment on the reports the couple are now in California. The palace has also consistently refused to comment on security matters involving the couple.\nHarry, Meghan and their baby son, Archie, are said to be living in lockdown near Hollywood in accordance with the state\u2019s Covid-19 containment measures.\nA source told the Sun the move had been \u201cplanned for some time\u201d and that California, where Meghan, a former actor, grew up, was where their \u201cnew team of Hollywood agents and PRs and business managers were based\u201d.\nBefore marrying into the royal family, Meghan had described Trump as being \u201cmisogynistic\u201d and \u201cdivisive\u201d during his 2016 presidential campaign, pledging her vote for his rival Hillary Clinton, and threatening to move to Canada if he won.\nBefore his state visit to the UK last June, Trump was asked about her comments in an interview with the Sun.

However, there are concerns that the pandemic will mean that the government support available to help EU citizens will reduce, and public awareness campaigns, designed to reach the most vulnerable people and those without an online presence, will be delayed.\nCampaigners claim that this could hit the very care workers \u2013 NHS staff and delivery workers \u2013 who are helping the country deal with the virus.\nThe Right to Stay campaign, newly launched by Another Europe is Possible and supported by the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, is urging the government to replace the application process for settled status with a guaranteed right to stay for all EU citizens residing in the UK written into law.\nZoe Gardner, of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, said: \u201cThe coronavirus crisis means that the entire system of applications is at risk of failing.\n\u201cSupport services to help people through the process are largely face to face and simply won\u2019t be able to function for a prolonged period, with charities designed to support vulnerable EU citizens severely limited in their ability to support vulnerable people.\u201d\nThe charity sector, which also helps offer advice to EU citizens, could also be overwhelmed by the crisis as their resources are diverted to help people navigate the welfare system.\nClara Angela di Stefano, an NHS intensive care nurse from Italy, said: \u201cIn the next few months, migrants are going to save countless lives in NHS hospitals. Many of us will get sick, and some will die.\n\u201cWe are proud to do this work. But when this crisis is over, many thousands of EU migrants could lose their status here because the government has insisted on persisting with a broken application system. Boris Johnson can solve this problem easily \u2013 by giving us a right to stay written into law.\u201d\nThe government has already announced that the settled status processing service has been delayed by Covid-19. It normally takes about five days. To be eligible, EU citizens usually need to have lived in the UK, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man for at least six months in any 12-month period for five years in a row.\nThe Home Office declined 300 applications in February, which the department said had been because applicants had failed to provide the government with the correct evidence or information.\n This article was amended on 30 March 2020. An earlier version misnamed the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants as the Joint Committee for the Welfare of Immigrants, and said that organisation launched the Right to Stay campaign with Another Europe is Possible. The JCWI supports the Right to Stay campaign, but was not involved with its launch. This has been corrected.",

It will be the first such limit since the university admission cap was lifted in 2015.\nThis month, the Guardian reported that British universities faced a black hole of hundreds of millions of pounds in tuition fees as international students from China and other countries severely affected by coronavirus are forced to cancel or postpone enrolments.\nUK university campuses are closed and teaching has moved online. To avoid certain universities hoovering up domestic students to fill their courses, leaving other, less prestigious institutions with empty lecture theatres, the pain will be spread through the introduction of a cap, it is understood.\n\u201cUnless there are significant developments, this will happen,\u201d said one policymaker involved in the discussions between the government and universities.\nThe imposition of a cap means that students currently going through the application process are set to have their choices restricted. It also means some students will not be able to attend universities at which they have been offered place.\nThe policy was backed by the board of Universities UK at a virtual meeting held on Friday, although it was strongly opposed by some leading universities, including several members of the Russell Group of research-intensive institutions.\nThe decision is likely to be announced within the next few days, although some well-known institutions are fighting a rearguard battle in Whitehall over worries that they will also face financial difficulty if they cannot recruit additional student numbers from the UK to replace the international tuition fees they expect to lose.\nAlistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK (UUK), the group that includes most mainstream English universities, said: \u201cThe UUK board discussed a range of measures needed to promote financial stability of the sector in these tough times. Foremost was the need for government financial support for universities. Student number controls were discussed and it was agreed that further consideration of the pros and cons were needed, with further input from members.\u201d\nMany university vice-chancellors back the temporary reimposition of intake controls, a policy abandoned by the government in 2015. They see it as a way of avoiding a brutal recruitment season after a group of universities, including Essex, began aggressively offering unconditional offers, which award places without regard for a student\u2019s exam results, to sixth-formers as the scale of the coronavirus epidemic emerged.\n\u201cThere is huge panic among universities at the moment. In the short term at least, a cap on student numbers would be welcomed,\u201d said a senior figure at one English university.\nVice-chancellors were already nervous about their international student recruitment for this year and 2021, especially those relying on students from China, who now account for 120,000 full-time students in the UK.\nCompetition for domestic students was already fierce because the number of school leavers in the population hits a demographic trough in the UK this year. But after UK schools were shut down and A-level exams scrapped this month, there was a rush by universities to begin converting conditional offers to unconditional ones, as fears emerged that they would lose out to more prestigious rivals.\n\u201cSome universities behaved very badly,\u201d said one participant, who argued that the university application service Ucas should have been frozen by the government as soon as the announcement about schools and A-levels was made to avoid a scramble for students.\nThe government and the Office for Students, the higher education regulator for England, called for a moratorium on unconditional offers, but that is set to expire, with signs that what one official dubbed a free-for-all would be reignited unless a cap was imposed.\nNick Hillman, the head of the Higher Education Policy Institute(Hepi), who was previously a special adviser to the government, said: \u201cThere has to be a policy response to this severe crisis, and we have to protect our university sector at a time of such profound change.\n\u201cBut there are people who have long wanted to restrict access to higher education who might see this as the chance to do it. Yet when there are fewer jobs to go around, education becomes more important, not less.\u201d\nHillman said the coronavirus pandemic was \u201cfast becoming the catalyst for the return of student number caps\u201d, in opposition to \u201cevery ministerial utterance since at least 2010\u201d on the subject.\n\u201cReintroducing number caps would protect those universities that have grown the most in recent years by locking down the number of home students that they educate and stopping others from growing at their expense. Older, more prestigious universities would be the biggest losers, as they had hoped to be able to replace lost international students with more home students,\u201d Hillman said.\nThose university leaders opposed to the cap argue that there is no rush to impose the policy, given the uncertainties over how the coronavirus crisis will play out, and that decisions on admissions could wait until July at the latest.\nChris Husbands, vice-chancellor of Sheffield Hallam University, is to argue in an article to be published by Hepi on Monday that \u201cradical action is needed on university admissions\u201d, including the reintroduction of student number controls for more than one year.\nA Department for Education spokesperson said: \u201cWe are committed to supporting our world-class higher education institutions, and will continue working closely with the sector to manage the impact of coronavirus.\n \u201cWe recognise the challenges universities are facing, but are impressed by their resilience and efforts to tackle the virus, through the use of labs, accommodation and community support.\u201d\n This article was amended on 30 March 2020. An earlier version incorrectly included Liverpool University among those making unconditional offers. The article had also said that UK universities were closed; this was later clarified to say UK university campuses were closed and teaching had moved online and the article amended accordingly.",

No doubt its time was coming anyway, but the coronavirus pandemic has made it the most-watched competition in European football. As the only top-tier league still playing through the crisis, however, that isn\u2019t hard. Happiest of all that Belarus is reporting virtually no infections are sports bettors, and by extension the wagering companies who accommodate them.\nInternet pages are now awash with blogs, tips and previews on Slutsk v Dynamo Brest. Experts are coming out of the woodwork to steer you into the correct score/first goalscorer double in the Isloch v Smolevichi-STI blockbuster. \u201cSports such as Taiwanese basketball, Belarusian Premier League and Tajikistan men\u2019s basketball are up approximately 2,000%,\u201d a Tabcorp spokesman told Guardian Australia. It seems any port in a storm will do for Australia\u2019s legion of sports punters who contribute a not-insignificant proportion towards a gambling industry worth almost $25bn annually.\nThe Belarus Premier League is the gift that keeps on giving. Some cracking matchups tonight as the league rolls on! \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\ude02 pic.twitter.com/1a7t1jtnBs\nWhile turnover increases in the thousands might look good on paper, nobody is suggesting the Belarusian Premier League is a panacea for companies who make money out of other people\u2019s opinions. But in a time when almost all professional sport has ground to a halt, betting on a league many might not have heard of six weeks ago shows how committed some are to getting set.\nAnd the bookies are obliging. Been following the Russian Fiba 3x3 recently? No? You\u2019re missing out. Tabcorp is reporting the competition as \u201cthe most popular\u201d with sports punters. \u201cThere was already some interest in this as it will be an Olympic sport in the next Games, but overall in the last week it is up 50%.\u201d\nAnd it doesn\u2019t stop there. With a hit or kicked ball nowhere to be seen, Australian gamblers are being offered products once considered somewhere between esoteric and non-existent. On top of the standard suite of markets on reality TV shows \u2013 in 2019, Tabcorp held $1.3m on Masterchef alone \u2013 customers can invest their wagering dollar on the US election, the Nobel Peace Prize and the Time Person of the Year. \u201cFor the Nobel, the eventual inventors of the vaccine for Covid-19 are the $2 favourites and the World Health Organisation are the $2 favourites to be named Time Person/People of the Year,\u201d the Tabcorp spokesman said.\nIf weather watching is your thing \u2013 and with many of life\u2019s pleasures on hold, it might well become a thing for many \u2013 you\u2019re in luck. \u201cWe have also this week opened markets on the weather \u2013 punters can bet whether the temperature in each major city will go above or below a certain temperature.\u201d\nIt would seem a market on two flies climbing up a wall is next but horse racing and greyhound racing in Australia are still in operation. Paused in several states last week when it was reported a jockey had been tested for Covid-19, thoroughbred racing resumed in time for the weekend\u2019s autumn carnival action after Mark Zahra returned a negative. The duty-of-care concerns attached to an industry that depends on animals aside, the continuation of racing is a godsend for the hundreds of thousands of people who either work in the industry or invest in it. And for those who follow it.\nThe situation is far grimmer in the UK. With all sport and racing now halted, industries have been decimated and multitudes left out of work.\nThe Racing Post, the daily bible of British horse racing and sports betting, has ceased production of its newspaper during the outbreak and is only publishing its digital edition. There isn\u2019t much to write about. In its popular \u2018What to watch on Saturday\u2019 column, readers were pointed to Australian horse racing, the Belarusian Premier League (of course) and a re-run of Minder, with the connection being that the actor playing the leading role was a fan of horse racing.\nThese are indeed challenging times, with no end in immediate view. When approached for comment, a senior content editor at the UK betting exchange, Betconnect, duly obliged \u2013 in one of his final tasks before redundancy left him jobless. \u201cIt is a very hard time for many sectors and many businesses,\u201d he said. \u201cBetConnect would normally expect to trade several million pounds of bets in a regular month and spring is a particularly good time of year. Virtually none of the usual revenue will be coming our way.\u201d",

        "content": "Bleak outlook will lead to tens of thousands of job losses and comes after tough conditions in 2019 \nThe coronavirus pandemic is expected to lead to the demise of thousands of restaurants, pubs, shopping chains and other high street businesses, despite the government offering unprecedented financial support and changing insolvency rules to give companies more time to pay debts.\nThe nationwide lockdown has already forced the permanent closure of almost all branches of the restaurant chains Carluccio\u2019s and Chiquito. Other big restaurant groups, pubs and shopping chains have warned that they could collapse if the government extends the self-isolation conditions beyond the initial three-week period.\nThe fashion chain Monsoon Accessorize said on Sunday it had been badly affected by the outbreak and was looking at a range of options. One is a sale of the business, which is being explored by restructuring experts at FRP Advisory, raising fears for the future of the chain\u2019s 3,500 employees.\nThe number of people visiting the high street has decreased by three-quarters since the government ordered non-key workers to venture out of their homes only to buy food, for other essential services, or for daily exercise.\nThe retail intelligence firm Springboard said footfall last Tuesday \u2013 the first day of the lockdown \u2013 was down 75.4% compared with the same day in 2019. \u201cThe annual decline in UK footfall on Tuesday 24 March was the most severe on any day since the start of the coronavirus outbreak, but it was still less than in both Italy and the US,\u201d said Diane Wehrle, marketing and insights director of Springboard.\nPressure on retailers was underlined by analysts at Goldman Sachs, who predicted that clothing and homeware sales at Marks & Spencer could fall by 60% in the three months to the end of June. The credit rating agency Standard & Poor\u2019s has cut its assessment of M&S\u2019s long-term debt from BBB to BB+, a grade that is often referred to as \u201cjunk\u201d debt.\nThe downturn comes as new figures showed that pub and restaurant businesses were already under severe pressure before the coronavirus struck the UK.\nMore than 1,400 restaurant businesses and at least 500 pub businesses collapsed into insolvency last year, according to the accountancy group UHY Hacker Young. The number of collapses in 2019 was 10% higher than in 2018, and included high-profile names such as Jamie Oliver\u2019s UK restaurant empire.\nPeter Kubik, a partner at UHY Hacker Young, said restaurant chains were likely to be the hardest hit from the coronavirus crisis. \u201cMost other businesses can shift their staff to home working or sell through the internet. Clearly that is not possible for pubs,\u201d he said.\nThe Restaurant Group has said the majority of its Chiquito restaurants will not reopen when movement restrictions are lifted, and nor will its 11 London-based Food & Fuel pubs, leading to the loss of 1,500 jobs.\nThe group, which also owns Wagamama and Frankie & Benny\u2019s, has previously blamed falling sales for the decision to close more than 100 of its outlets. The company is run by Andy Hornby, who was chief executive of HBOS during the 2008 financial crisis when the bank had to be rescued by Lloyds TSB.\nThe Italian restaurant chain Carluccio\u2019s is understood to be preparing to file for administration. The restructuring specialist FRP Advisory confirmed it was working with the chain, which has 73 sites and about 2,000 employees.\nFred Diamond, a consumer analyst at GlobalData, said the outlook for the restaurant and pub sector looked increasingly bleak. \u201cAs people adjust to isolation by making their home as comfortable as possible, street retailers will have an even harder time convincing people to leave their living rooms. The restaurant sector will, by the end of this, have fewer stores and less cash,\u201d Diamond said.",

It is vital that this message hits home and that misinformation and disinformation which undermines it is knocked down quickly. We\u2019re working with social media companies, and I\u2019ll be pressing them this week for further action to stem the spread of falsehoods and rumours which could cost lives.\u201d\nWhen false narratives are identified online or on social media, the government\u2019s rapid response unit coordinates with departments across Whitehall to find a way to tackle the content if it cannot be taken down. This can include a direct rebuttal on social media and ensuring public health campaigns are promoted through reliable sources.\nThe unit is one of the teams feeding into the wider \u201ccounter-disinformation cell\u201d led by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, made up of experts from across government and the tech sector.\nDowden will be contacting social media companies again this week to discuss what other measures could be put in place to ensure accurate, honest information consistently reaches users of their platforms.\nPenny Mordaunt, the paymaster general, said: \u201cHolding your breath for 10 seconds is not a test for coronavirus and gargling water for 15 seconds is not a cure \u2013 this is the kind of false advice we have seen coming from sources claiming to be medical experts.\n\u201cThat is why government communicators are working in tandem with health bodies to promote official medical advice \u2026 but the public can also help with this effort, so today we implore them to take some simple steps before sharing information online, such as always reading beyond the headline and scrutinising the source.\u201d\nAmong the examples the rebuttal unit has investigated is a fake text sent after the UK government sent a message to the public about staying at home. The second false text message in circulation claimed that some people had already been fined.\n  A series of scams purporting to be from HMRC offering tax refunds also appeared online, including doctored screenshots of official government website Gov.uk.\nThe unit asked the telecoms industry to block offending text message aggregators and requested removal of malicious content from internet providers. HMRC digital teams also used social media to alert the public about the scam.\nWhatsApp messages and Facebook posts widely circulated since the outbreak began include false medical advice claiming to be from \u201cStanford Hospital Board\u201d. This advice included drinking or gargling water to \u201cwash the virus down into the stomach, where acid could kill it\u201d.\nThe unit asked the Department of Health and Social Care to create and share posts on Facebook and Twitter to rebut false medical advice and direct the public to official guidance.",

It is estimated that the outbreak of Covid-19 has led to a 40% reduction in donations to community food banks across the country, when most are seeing demand for their services soar.\nMorrisons is the only British supermarket to have its own sites supplying meat, fish, fruit and vegetables, bakery and other products that help to make more than half of the fresh food sold in its 495 stores. There are 14 Morrison production sites across the UK.\nDavid Potts, chief executive of Morrisons, said: \u201cAs a food maker and shopkeeper we are uniquely placed to help.

The volunteers will perform support roles, such as changing beds under the guidance of trained nurses, and will continue to be paid by the airlines.\nWork is under way to convert the ExCeL centre in London\u2019s docklands into a 4,000-bed hospital, with an initial capacity for 500 beds with ventilators and oxygen. The hospital could open as early as this week. Two more Nightingale hospitals are being built at Manchester\u2019s Central Convention Centre and the NEC in Birmingham.\nBut as volunteers for unskilled work flood in, doctors have expressed concern about where the specialist medics and nurses will come from. One London doctor who spoke to the Guardian said there would be no new staff, meaning those already working in NHS critical care would be spread even more thinly.\n\u201cIt was all framed as if there would be a cavalry coming of newly upskilled doctors, doctors from other regions, and those out of retirement to staff it. But it is becoming more clear there is not a cavalry but just more space for us to spread into, but with the same number of staff,\u201d the doctor said.\n\u201cAt first the Nightingale felt like a great idea, as though a bunch of people would come to run it, but now we have realised it is robbing Peter to pay Paul and it feels more like a publicity stunt.\u201d\nAnother medic who spoke to the Guardian said that critical care doctors and nurses in units across London had been asked to volunteer for the new coronavirus hospital.\nDuncan Young, professor of intensive care medicine at Oxford University, said under normal \u201cpeacetime\u201d conditions, a hospital has six to seven nurses per ventilator bed. A minimum of 500 to 1,000 experienced nurses would be needed to cope with 500 patients, he said, but only if the hospital ran well below recommended staffing levels.\n\u201cIt will be really hard working at the ExCeL. It will be a high stress environment where the staff won\u2019t know processes such as getting supplies, getting help, knowing where to send blood tests and so on, which are almost second nature at their home hospital,\u201d Young said.\n\u201cI am not sure that upskilling nurses from other disciplines will work, not least because all the trainers are doing frontline work. A large number of similarly experienced doctors will be needed and one-fifth will develop Covid-19 and be off for a couple of weeks,\u201d he added.\nSome volunteers are expected to be well-trained military intensive care nurses and doctors, who are largely based in Birmingham, but many are believed to have been pressed into service already.\nRuth May, the chief nursing officer for England, said: \u201cThousands of nurses, medics and other expert staff are returning to work alongside us, but we need everyone to do their bit \u2013 whether that is working in one of our current health or social care services, working in the Nightingale hospital, volunteering to help the NHS, or following government advice to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.\u201d",

        "content": "The former champion trainer hopes racing can resume with a condensed schedule but knows he is luckier than many\nThis would normally be the start of a very busy few months for Richard Hannon, whose two big stables near Salisbury Plain are home to lots of fast, precocious young horses. The months of April, May and June are hay-making time for trainers with that kind of stock, so the suspension of racing until at least the end of next month makes things very difficult for his operation.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hugely worrying,\u201d says Hannon, who was champion trainer in his first season, 2014, with a licence. \u201cThese two-year-olds, you only have a certain window of opportunity. And then you\u2019ve got the Classic generation.\u201d But he notes the timing could have been even worse, if the coronavirus had sent Britain into lockdown in the autumn, after Hannon had spent hefty sums buying horses at the sales and before he had sold them on to various owners.\n\u201cWe\u2019re lucky this didn\u2019t come along in October, November, when I would have had about 50 yearlings around my neck. We sold them all but we need to get back racing, if we can.\u201d\nHannon has an idea of how it could be managed, if and when the sport is allowed to resume racing behind closed doors. He suggests a lot of action compressed into each day, rotating between the all-weather courses from one day to the next.\n\u201cYou could have 20 races a day, 15 minutes between each race. Jockeys could only ride in every other race. From 9am to 5pm and we can get through the backlog, maybe. The prize money\u2019s there, it\u2019s been allocated. They can keep the jockeys apart by giving them the grandstand. There could be five metres between them, other than when they\u2019re in the stalls. And you wouldn\u2019t need five different tracks each day, using five different ambulances.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just an idea, I don\u2019t know if it would work. The Flat trainers, we\u2019ve got our horses ready now and with this nice weather, they come right in their coats they look great. I\u2019m training mine as if we start early next month.\u201d\nHannon, his family and staff have remained healthy but he is acutely aware that others have been less fortunate. \u201cThe NHS staff are doing a fabulous job in really difficult circumstances. We all owe them a great debt of gratitude.\u201d\nHe plans to show that by donating \u00a325 to the NHS for each winner he trains this year, which ought to yield a sum running into several thousand pounds.\nIn the meantime there is hope, which has always been central to racing\u2019s appeal and which Hannon believes can be a source of comfort to his owners.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure a lot of them will have had investments in the stock market and other things that obviously won\u2019t have gone well. But the great thing about a lot of our horses is that you don\u2019t know what they are, what they could be. People who own unraced two-year-olds have always got hope for the future. You could own that good one. That\u2019s why two-year-olds are so exciting and why there\u2019s always a market for them.\u201d\nAside from the horses, Hannon has his family to help keep his own spirits up. \u201cI\u2019ve got two young kids and the weather\u2019s nice, so you can go outside and spend a bit of time with them. It\u2019s OK now but I should imagine after a few weeks there\u2019s going to be some awful cabin fever.\n\u201cWe\u2019re very lucky, we live in a lovely place in the country and we have some space, we work with lovely animals. It makes us a lot better off than most people at this time. We don\u2019t have anything to moan about, that way. There\u2019s a lot of people living in cities who have it a lot harder than we do.\u201d\nWhile he was at school, Hannon had no thought other than one day taking over his father\u2019s racing stable; will he now be getting involved in the home-schooling of his children? \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019d pass many exams if I was home-schooling them,\u201d he says, laughing. \u201cBut we have a bit of a laugh with them and they\u2019re reading plenty of books.\n\u201cThey\u2019re not allowed to see Granny and Grandad, even though they live 100 yards down the road and always have a drawer full of sweets. At the moment, the sweets are being passed through letterboxes and through the window sometimes.\u201d",

The next morning, her landlady returned with two men and demanded the nurse leave immediately, even after it was explained she was not treating any coronavirus patients and had no symptoms.\n\u201cShe would not listen to me,\u201d said the nurse, who asked not to be named. \u201cShe told me, \u2018There must be coronavirus patients around you in your hospital. We know that the virus floats in the air and infects everyone around. This is why thousands of people around the world have been infected. You have to leave the apartment.\u201d\nThe nurse said she and her children had been forced to move in with her mother, who lives in a single-room house in a slum. \u201cFive of us have to huddle in that 10ft by 10ft room now,\u201d she said. \u201cI am working on 12-hour shifts in my hospital. It\u2019s all extremely exhausting. And now I have to find a new place to live \u2013 but if people know that I work as a nurse in a big city hospital no one will be willing to rent out an apartment to me.\u201d\nWomen who work as private ayahs \u2013 domestic servants \u2013 in hospitals described how they too had been driven out of their homes in the past few days. Kajori Haldar, 48, an ayah at a Calcutta Medical College and Hospital, said neighbours had visited her husband and told him they would not let her return to the community for the next three months because of fears she was carrying coronavirus.\n\u201cWhile I am not on duty, I just find some space to spread out a plastic sheet and take rest here,\u201d said Haldar. \u201cThis is my makeshift home now.\u201d\nSaraswati Naskar, 40, another ayah who lives in a slum in Kolkata and works in a government hospital, said she had to pretend to her neighbours she now worked in a restaurant. \u201cI know many ayahs and other low-profile hospital workers who have stopped going to their homes and now sleep somewhere inside the hospital campus,\u201d said Naskar.\nDelhi: Resident Doctors Association (RDA) of All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) has written to Home Minister Amit Shah requesting appropriate action against the eviction of healthcare professionals from their homes and provision of transport facility. #COVID2019 pic.twitter.com/n7G7P1kEHl\nThe problem has become so bad that doctors at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences recently wrote to the government pleading for assistance. \u201cMany doctors are stranded on the roads with all their luggage, nowhere to go, across the country,\u201d they said in the letter. In both Delhi and West Bengal, the government has now ordered action against anyone threatening to evict health care workers.\nDaily life is getting increasingly challenging for anyone associated with the fight against coronavirus. Arghyadeep Ganguly, a junior doctor at Beleghata Infectious Disease hospital in Kolkata, described how seven taxi drivers refused to pick him up when they realised he was a doctor working in a so-called \u2018coronavirus hospital\u2019.\n\u201cSeveral of my senior doctors have been asked to vacate their rented rooms and other paying guest accommodations by their landlords who fear doctors will transmit the virus to them,\u201d said Ganguly. \u201cIt seems that the people in the country have found yet another reason to ostracise and abuse its medical personnel who are at the frontline of this battle against Covid-19.\u201d",

        "content": "Services from Moscow to Rio go ahead as some clerics disregard coronavirus risk\nMillions of people across the world tuned into online church services on Sunday as their usual places of worship were closed, but in some places clerics insisted on their doors remaining open.\nThe day after Pope Francis delivered a blessing in an empty St Peter\u2019s Square, watched on television by an estimated 11 million people, Sunday services were held at some of Russia\u2019s largest religious sites after Orthodox church leaders said they were an expression of religious freedom.\nDozens of parishioners, many of them elderly, crowded into Kazan Cathedral in St Petersburg to receive communion. Earlier this month, the cathedral came under fire for continuing to exhibit a relic of John the Baptist despite fears that visitors kissing the exhibit could hasten the spread of coronavirus.\nIn virus-hit Louisiana, hundreds of worshippers attended services on Sunday, flouting a ban on large gatherings. An estimated 500 people of all ages filed inside the Life Tabernacle church in Central, a city of nearly 29,000 outside Baton Rouge\nThe Russian Orthodox church had insisted that mayors could not close churches and that it would continue to \u201cfulfil its pastoral duty\u201d unless given an order from the Kremlin.\nBut later on Sunday the church\u2019s leader, Patriarch Kirill of Moscow, called on believers to refrain from visiting churches.\nSpeaking after the liturgy at Christ the Saviour church in Moscow, Kirill said: \u201cI have been preaching for 51 years, calling on people to come to church, overcome the gravitation of their own ill will and external circumstances, I dedicated my entire life to this call and I hope you understand how difficult it is for me to say now: refrain from visiting churches.\u201d\nIn Romania and Georgia, two countries with strongly Orthodox Christian populations, there has been consternation over the insistence of some priests on continuing to use a shared spoon for the communion ritual.\nLast Sunday, the day after Romania had been put into a strict lockdown, footage emerged from the city of Cluj of priests using a shared spoon. In Georgia, while the church has told worshippers not to spend long periods of time in churches and not to come if ill, it has rejected calls to abandon the reusing of spoons, claiming that as communion is a holy ceremony it is not possible to get ill during it.\nIn devoutly Catholic Poland, coronavirus restrictions limited the number of churchgoers to 50 at a time, and this was reduced again last week to five. Archbishop Stanis\u0142aw G\u0105decki, the head of the Polish episcopate, earlier in March called for more church services to accommodate worshippers, as not praying during the epidemic would be \u201cunthinkable\u201d. However, he has since urged faithful to use media broadcasts of services to prayer, especially over the Easter period.\nIn Brazil, the president, Jair Bolsonaro \u2013 who has called the coronavirus a \u201clittle flu\u201d and attacked lockdown \u2013 included churches in a list of \u201cpublic services and essential activities\u201d essential for the \u201csurvival, health and safety\u201d of the population, provided they followed health ministry guidelines.\nTwo days after Bolsonaro\u2019s pronouncement, a judge in Rio de Janeiro state suspended his decree. Cathedrals in S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro are now closed. And while some churches are still open for prayer, mass and services have mostly moved online.\nDom Walmor Azevedo, the archbishop of Belo Horizonte and president of the National Conference of Bishops of Brazil (CNBB), last week told congregations to \u201cstay at home\u201d. The CNBB and other Catholic organisations called Bolsonaro\u2019s \u201cdisinformation campaign\u201d a \u201cserious threat to all Brazilians\u201d.\nAbout half of Brazilians are Catholic, but a growing number \u2013 currently 31% \u2013 belong to evangelical churches, which largely support Bolsonaro. Brazil\u2019s biggest, the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God, said on Thursday that where services are not allowed, its churches are open for prayer. Where services are allowed, it controls numbers entering and provides soap and water.\nRio\u2019s Assembly of God Victory in Christ church is open every day for \u201cprayers and to attend those who need it\u201d, said its pastor, Alexandre Camargo, but services went online even after it won a court battle to stay open. Rio\u2019s Attitude Baptist church \u2013 frequented by Brazil\u2019s first lady, Michelle Bolsonaro \u2013 is only holding online services.\n\u201cPeople are really suffering with this, because they need this spiritual, emotional and financial support,\u201d said Pastor Josu\u00e9 Valandro Jr. \u201cIt is very serious to close all the churches.\u201d\nThe Vatican said at the weekend that Pope Francis did not have coronavirus after testing of Holy See staff resulted in one new case. The total number of people with Covid-19 at the Vatican is now six. \u201cI can confirm that neither the Holy Father nor his closest collaborators are involved,\u201d a spokesperson said.\n This article\u2019s headline and subheading were amended on 1 April 2020 to better reflect the text.",

A 14-day state of emergency came into effect on Tuesday imposing a curfew on the country\u2019s roughly eight million residents and restricting travel across the country.\nThe state of emergency has also imposed significant restrictions on who can speak to the media, with many doctors saying they were forbidden from discussing issues with the Guardian.\nA senior doctor, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told Guardian Australia: \u201cPNG is not prepared to fight the virus simply because it does not have the funds to do so.\n\u201cThe national government must come clean on the financial front and tell the people whether there is money available to fight the coronavirus or not, because currently almost all hospitals lack basic medical supplies to attend to ordinary illnesses in the country.\u201d\nResidents in Port Moresby have also come out expressing concern about the possible shortage of food and other basic necessities in shops and markets, as the country went into lock down.\nOne resident told Guardian Australia: \u201cI don\u2019t think the lock down is a good idea, as many of our people are going into panic buying while other unfortunate ones are unable to do that now because they simply do not have the money to buy extra food and basic supplies.\u201d\nIn response to the sit-in protest by nurses, prime minister James Marape gave assurances to the nurses and doctors that PPEs will be made available to them this week.\nMarape has also assured Papua New Guineans that food and basic supplies will not run out and that they should not panic and that the national government is doing all it can to protect the people and ensure there are no new cases of the virus in the country.\nLike other Pacific Island countries, it is fighting hard at keeping its first case at just one, while also trying to ensure there is no local transmission.\nThe prime minister, James Marape, said when parliament is recalled next Thursday, \u201ctwo bills will be enacted as Emergency Laws and they are the proposed Emergency General Provisions Bill 2020 and the Proposed Emergency Defence Force COVID-19 Bill 2020.\u201d\nThe deputy director of the PNG Institute of Medical Research, Dr Moses Laman, said the institute in Goroka, Eastern Highlands Province, is fully capable of testing for the Covid-19 as it is accredited by the World Health Organization.\n\u201cThere is really no need for test samples to be further verified in Australia, however depending on the case and upon request from the National Government, samples are sent for further checks like the first confirmed case.\u201d\nHealth Minister Jelta Wong said there are currently 580 testing kits available in the country, and another 4,000 will arrive over the next week.\n\u201cPCR testing equipment has arrived in Port Moresby already and is undergoing optimisation, by 1 April testing should begin with 200 tests per day. The Central Public Laboratory should come online on 8 April with another 200 tests per day, so collectively there will be 700 tests conducted per day in the country.\u201d\nThe Bomana Immigration Centre is among two other facilities being considered to be used as isolation units for coronavirus cases in Port Moresby.\nThe police minister, Bryan Kramer, said \u201cthe centre is an extremely new modern facility built by the Australian Government which is being considered among the others at Six Mile and the Rita Flynn courts.\u201d",

        "content": "President extends social distancing rules to 30 April, saying open for Easter plans were only \u2018aspirational\u2019\nDonald Trump has extended America\u2019s national shutdown for a month, bowing to public health experts, and scientific reality, and warning that the worst of the coronavirus pandemic is yet to come.\nSpeaking in the White House Rose Garden, the US president claimed that, if his administration keeps the death toll to 100,000, it will have done \u201ca very good job\u201d \u2013 a startling shift from his optimistic predictions of a few days ago when he said he hoped to restart the economy by Easter.\nTrump also undermined his plea for unity by uttering falsehoods, verbally abusing reporters and making incendiary allegations that implied health care workers were stealing masks, without providing evidence.\nThe extended deadline marked a humiliating retreat for the president who, having squandered six precious weeks at the start of the pandemic, more recently complained that the cure is worse than the problem and floated Easter Sunday as a \u201cbeautiful timeline\u201d for reopening big swathes of the country.\nOn Sunday he claimed this had only been \u201caspirational\u201d as his advisers urged him not to move too hastily. He announced the initial 15-day period of social distancing urged by the federal government, which was due to expire on Monday, would be extended to 30 April, and said he hoped normality might return by 1 June.\nThe guidelines recommend against big group gatherings and urge older people and anyone with existing health problems to stay at home. People were also urged to work at home when possible and avoid restaurants, bars, non-essential travel and shopping trips.\n\u201cThe modelling estimates that the peak in death rate is likely to hit in two weeks,\u201d Trump told reporters, with the toll already at more than 2,400. \u201cNothing would be worse than declaring victory before the victory is won. That would be the greatest loss of all.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cWe can expect by June 1st we will be well on our way to recovery.\u201d\nThe shift came as the full horror of the pandemic appeared to dawn on a president who long downplayed it. Dr Anthony Fauci, the government\u2019s top infectious disease expert, said the US could experience more than 100,000 deaths and millions of infections. Fauci praised the extension as a \u201cwise and prudent\u201d decision.\nTrump cited projection models that said potentially 2.2 million people or more could have died had the country tried to \u201cwing it\u201d and not put social distancing measures in place. \u201cI kept asking and we did models,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are 2.2 million people would have died.\n\u201cAnd so, if we could hold that down, as we\u2019re saying, to 100,000 \u2013 it\u2019s a horrible number, maybe even less, but to 100,000, so we have between 100 [thousand] and 200,000 \u2013 we altogether have done a very good job.\u201d\nTrump also appeared to have been rattled by scenes at Elmhurst Hospital where he grew up in Queens, New York. \u201cI\u2019ve been watching that for the last week on television,\u201d he said. \u201cBody bags all over, in hallways.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve been watching them bring in trailer trucks, freezer trucks, they\u2019re freezer trucks, because they can\u2019t handle the bodies, there are so many of them. This is essentially in my community, in Queens; Queens, New York. I\u2019ve seen things that I\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d\nTrump had minimised the threat of the coronavirus for weeks and ignored the pleas of his health secretary to investing in testing kits and breathing apparatus. The House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, told CNN\u2019s State of the Union this attitude had cost American lives. \u201cThe president, his denial at the beginning, was deadly,\u201d she said.\nTrump has long been criticised for refusing to own up to his own mistakes and shifting blame to others. In another lengthy, abrasive press conference, he pushed a conspiracy theory speculating that hospital staff may be stealing N95 masks and selling them on the black market.\nThe current demand does not square with what hospitals usually use, he told reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s a New York hospital, very \u2013 it\u2019s packed all the time. How do you go from 10 to 20 [thousand masks per week] to 300,000? Ten [thousand] to 20,000 masks, to 300,000 \u2013 even though this is different? Something is going on, and you ought to look into it as reporters. Are they going out the back door?\u201d\nHe added: \u201cHow do you go from 10,000 to 300,000? And we have that in a lot of different places. So somebody should probably look into that, because I just don\u2019t see from a practical standpoint how that\u2019s possible to go from that to that.\u201d\nWhen a reporter asked the president to clarify, he asked for New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio to investigate, adding: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s hoarding. I think it\u2019s maybe worse than hoarding.\u201d\nThe comments provoked widespread outrage. Joe Kennedy III, a Democratic Congressman from Massachusetts, tweeted: \u201cWe need supplies. We need masks. Our frontlines are suffering. Suggesting otherwise is disgusting.\u201d\nJoe Biden, the front runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, said: \u201cThis is ridiculous and completely false. Today\u2019s conspiracy mongering from our president is among the most reckless and ignorant moves he has made during this crisis, and there have been many. Lives hang in the balance.\u201d\nAs in previous briefings all week, the president picked fights with individual reporters including Yamiche Alcindor, a reporter at PBS NewsHour who is a woman of colour.\nWhen Alcindor questioned him about comments he made during an interview with Fox News\u2019s Sean Hannity that suggested state governors were making exaggerated demands, Trump retorted: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you act in a little more positive? ... It\u2019s always get ya, get ya, get ya. You know what? That\u2019s why nobody trusts the media anymore.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cLook, let me tell you something, be nice. Don\u2019t be threatening. Be nice.\u201d",

        "content": "Many left for home without even the chance to say goodbye, knowing that their big overseas experience may be lost forever\nSwapping in \u201caubergine\u201d for \u201ceggplant\u201d and \u201cpepper\u201d for \u201ccapsicum\u201d \u2013 when you remember. Watching two clocks, one 13 hours fast. Smugly renouncing Boris Johnson as \u201cnot MY prime minister\u201d.\nTo some extent, the experience of being a New Zealander in London has always been one of being split between two places. Now the coronavirus crisis has forced us to pick one.\nThe \u201cbig OE\u201d (overseas experience), a few years spent living and working abroad, has long been a rite of passage for young New Zealanders. Many leave home on the long, expensive journey with no return ticket, no work lined up and no housing more formal than the sofa bed of a friend of a friend in Hackney or Clapham (it is always Hackney or Clapham).\nMoving overseas is of course a privilege, not a right \u2013 but that does not mean it is always easy. It can be hard to find work, especially without taking a step down in pay or seniority. The culture shock of moving to a city of double New Zealand\u2019s national population, underground trains and pharmacies that sell sandwiches is disorienting. And homesickness is real, and seemingly felt proportionally to distance.\nNew Zealanders in London could hardly be further away from home \u2013 yet we move, in our thousands, all the same. In 2002 sociologist Claudia Bell, in one of the few academic examinations of the OE and its significance to New Zealand culture, identified these young traveller as \u201csecular pilgrims \u2026 collecting narratives of adventure and returning with tokens of place\u201d.\nCemented in the 1990s, the open-ended journey \u2013 from one of the world\u2019s most remote countries, to places familiar from popular history and culture \u2013 is key to the construction of New Zealand\u2019s national identity. Low travel budgets test independence and initiative, acclaimed as Kiwi characteristics, while myths and symbols of home intensify at a distance.\nAs a ritual, Bell ranked the OE alongside graduation, or marriage: \u201cThe aim is to see what is \u2018out there\u2019 before settling down,\u201d and returning to New Zealand permanently to live. Until then, we Kiwis abroad knew we were lucky to have the best of both worlds, experiencing the world\u2019s great cities with regular visits back to \u201cGodzone country\u201d.\nBut that rite of passage is made possible by air travel, open borders, and receptive economies \u2013 all of which have been disrupted and dismantled by the sudden onset of coronavirus, for the foreseeable future and perhaps for good. The impact was immediate in London\u2019s Kiwi enclaves, where the question crystallised as go home prematurely \u2013 or stay indefinitely.\nAs a dual citizen of New Zealand and the UK, my lifetime split evenly between the two, I was lucky to not have to think twice about staying put. For many New Zealanders, their ties in London were called into question, the roots they had put down exposed as lacking.\nFaced with potential redundancy, weeks of self-isolation in insecure or unfriendly housing, and the threat of not being otherwise able to return for months \u2013 many bolted for home. (Not to mention, a government response befitting of the crisis.)\nOne friend was back in Wellington before I could even wish her a safe flight, and spoke of international borders coming down behind her like dominoes. Another returned to Auckland just a few months after arriving in London from Berlin, and before that Sydney, for the third chapter of her OE.\nShe had agonised over whether to go on her two-week trip home as planned, knowing that she would likely not be allowed to return to the UK if she did. In the end, she opted to be where her support network was strongest: she went home.\nAs Anna Silman wrote for The Cut: \u201cThe pandemic has punctured the illusion of self-sufficient adulthood that those of us in our 20s and 30s have worked so hard to cultivate. You can have a job and an apartment and a social life \u2026 and still find that, when crisis hits, you want nothing more to be in your childhood [home].\u201d\nOver recent weeks the New Zealand diaspora, thought to total one million around the world, have resisted that temptation \u2013 or succumbed. My Facebook feed has been punctuated by hasty, regretful goodbyes as Kiwi friends in the UK, Europe, Canada and the US have heeded Jacinda Ardern\u2019s call to come home.\nEven some in Australia, relatively close, have skipped back across the ditch, excluded from financial support by their non-citizen status.\nSome have left behind partners for whom home is in the northern hemisphere, with no clear picture of when they will be reunited. Lives that were worked for have been uprooted, suddenly and painfully. Pilgrims have been returned before their time, their past a foreign country.\nOn the scale of tragedy we are seeing, these will, rightly, register as minor \u2013 my friends would agree they are lucky to have options, not least an irrevocable claim to one of the world\u2019s safest countries. But as Bell writes, the ritual of the OE is \u201cas much about returning home\u201d as it is about the departure: for many New Zealanders, that choice has been made for them, and they will mourn what they have lost.",

As a result, a dedicated website was set up in the hope it would dissuade them from ringing 111.\nBut since going live on Sunday the website has crashed at least once due to high demand, and registered more than 4,000 reports of bad behaviour \u2013 including people playing rugby or frisbee, and holding impromptu \u201ccorona parties\u201d.\nPolice commissioner Mike Bush said the \u201cvast majority\u201d of New Zealanders were complying with lockdown rules, and were \u201cpassionate and determined\u201d to make others toe the line as well.\nThree people had been detained for ignoring the rules, and one person remained in police custody, Bush said. Campervans with tourists travelling the country has been a persistent problem and it was \u201cconcerning\u201d to see hundreds of people out on Wellington waterfront \u2013 an issue that may need further attention, the commissioner warned.\nAlthough some incidents have warranted genuine police attention \u2013 such as bonfires at Muriwai beach and backpacker parties in Queenstown \u2013 other reported incidents were not a problem, including joggers and dog-walkers sticking to their own neighbourhoods \u2013 exercise that has been sanctioned by the prime minister.\nA police spokesperson said: \u201cNot every one of these over 4,000 reports will result in a visit from police. For example, some are reports of people jogging or walking past. People are of course allowed to do this within their own neighbourhoods. We have been attending where there are large groups of people congregating.\u201d\nThe Police are asking people not to use the 111 number to report breaches of the Alert Level 4 guidelines, as this is for emergencies only.You can either contact them by phone on 105 or online at https://t.co/95Sfp24cuT #kiakahawellington pic.twitter.com/eLKZPK21pt\nHowever, there remains confusion and debate as to what activities are permitted under lockdown, with some people under the impression that they cannot leave their homes under any circumstances, while others are continuing to walk, surf, run and play golf.\n\u201cYou need to stay in your bubble,\u201d a man screamed at an Auckland woman and her family on Browns Bay beach over the weekend, in a video posted online. \u201cYou\u2019re putting everyone at risk.\u201d\nThe family screamed back that they were walking only with people from their \u201cbubble\u201d and the activity was allowed, but the woman said the incident had terrified her three children.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no chance that we\u2019ll get our three boys to the beach again for a family walk, absolutely none,\u201d she said.\nMany New Zealanders reported similar instances of verbal abuse while out and about in their neighbourhood, and some say community Facebook pages had become full of abuse and threats.\nJohn Ombler, who is co-ordinating the government\u2019s response to the crisis, said some outdoor activity was permitted, and Ardern had also repeatedly endorsed the need for \u201cfresh air\u201d during the four-week lockdown.\n\u201cYou can leave the house for physical exercise by yourself or with other members of your household, stick to your bubble,\u201d Ombler said. \u201cBy all means, go for a short walk or run in your neighbourhood.\u201d\nThe Mental Health Foundation of New Zealand, a charity, said on its website the lockdown was \u201cscary\u201d for many people: \u201cIt\u2019s a tense time for most of us\u201d.\nA numbers of District Health Boards (DHBs) around the country have also issued pleas for New Zealanders to stop abusing confirmed Covid-19 cases online.\nHawke\u2019s Bay DHB said it was \u201cunacceptable\u201d and people needed to show calm and restraint. \u201cWe understand there is a high level of anxiety in the community, but it is not acceptable to attack people who have been caught up in this pandemic,\u201d said Hawke\u2019s Bay medical officer Nick Jones.\nNew Zealand has 589 confirmed cases of coronavirus, and a number of \u201cclusters\u201d had begun to emerge, the prime minister said, including from an Auckland pub, a wedding and a recent conference.\nArdern announced a new website on Monday for Kiwis to report incidents of \u201cprice gouging\u201d by supermarkets, who now lacked competition during the shutdown.\nCabinet met for the first time ever by Zoom on Monday, Ardern said, and she had been heartened that more than 6000 medical professionals had volunteered to come out of retirement and fight the virus.",

At some points, staff had been forced to either re-use the equipment or go without.\nDialysis units treat some of the healthcare system\u2019s most vulnerable patients, who are at \u201chigher risk of severe symptoms and complications from coronavirus\u201d, according to Kidney Health Australia. The leading not-for-profit organisation has advised dialysis patients to continue receiving their treatment amid the Covid-19 pandemic and to contact their dialysis unit to do so as safely as possible. If patients are unwell, particularly with a fever, they are advised to phone their unit and act on the advice of nursing staff.\nBeissel said his unit generally saw a maximum of about 32 patients a day across two shifts. They had, until recently, had only half a box of surgical masks to share between staff and patients.\nBeissel said promises of more stock had not materialised and staff had resorted to scrounging for their own masks.\n\u201cOur situation is not unique, which makes it even more appalling,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cNo one as far as I know is wearing a mask full-time. We are also running out of hand sanitiser, aprons and antiseptic wipes, with uncertainty about when or how we will get more.\u201d\nBeissel said staff at the unit received new surgical masks last week, but not the N95 or the P2 masks recommended by the federal government and NSW Health in certain higher-risk circumstances.\nThe unit is run by Fresenius Medical Care, a multinational giant, and one of the biggest dialysis treatment providers in the country.\nFresenius denied any suggestion of PPE shortages in its dialysis units and said it was meeting the government\u2019s guidelines on PPE use.\nThe Health Services Union, which represents aged care workers, said its members were also continuing to report problematic access to PPE.\nIn response to the recent PPE shortages in aged care, the government has opened up a direct line to the federal health department for providers, through which they can request supplies from the national medical stockpile.\nRequests are being triaged to prioritise PPE for providers who have had a confirmed case of Covid-19.\nThe Health Services Union\u2019s national secretary, Gerard Hayes, said it was crucial that PPE was distributed in a preventative way, rather than simply waiting for a problem to emerge.\n\u201cEverybody is on the same page here,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cDon\u2019t wait for the issue, you\u2019ve got to prevent it. That\u2019s the only way to resolve the matter in aged care. If they can open up those stockpiles now, and hopefully they have, that will at least stop issues developing.\u201d\nThe Australian Healthcare and Hospitals Association\u2019s chief executive, Alison Verhoeven, said there was currently a \u201chigh degree of prioritisation\u201d of PPE to critical areas of the healthcare system.\nThe national pandemic plan set out a hierarchy of organisations that could distribute PPE, she said.\nHospital access to PPE from the national medical stockpile was requested by the state health departments. General practice and community pharmacy requests were being governed by primary health networks, with GPs given priority, particularly in areas with high rates of chronic disease.\nVerhoeven told the Guardian that other health businesses, such as dentistry and physiotherapy, were much further down the priority list. \u201cWhat the government has been doing has been prioritising that to areas which absolutely have to function and can\u2019t function without PPE.\n\u201cClearly that\u2019s intensive care, and it is the management of vulnerable patients \u2026 dialysis patients, Aboriginal communities, some very vulnerable older people. Managing their care is actually quite tricky without PPE.\u201d\nThe cancer treatment centre Chris O\u2019Brien Lifehouse currently had adequate stocks of PPE but knew it had \u201cgreater challenges to face before this is over\u201d, said its chief executive, Eileen Hannagan. The centre was left in a difficult position when 200 litres of its hand sanitiser \u201cstrangely went missing\u201d earlier this month.\nHannagan said the losses were made up by donations of sanitiser ingredients from across Sydney and interstate, including from universities, gin distilleries, hairdressers and chemists. The centre was now using the donations to produce its own sanitiser.\n\u201cThe challenge is looking after our staff and ensuring they feel safe and supported,\u201d Hannagan said. \u201cWe\u2019re balancing their understandable anxiety and fears against the responsible use of PPE for the protection of staff and patients and ensuring supply into the future. We know we have greater challenges to face before this is over.\u201d",

Here is an updated list of the federal government\u2019s shutdown measures.\nIn general, no more than two people can be in public together, unless they are part of the same household. Weddings and funerals have separate limits (see below). All over-70s are \u201cstrongly advised\u201d to stay at home, as well as those over 60 who have a chronic illness, and Indigenous people over 50.\nRegistered and licensed clubs, licensed premises in hotels and pubs, casinos and night clubs\nCinemas and entertainment venues\nAuctions and open house inspections\nPersonal services such as beauty therapy, tanning, massage and tattoo parlours (but not physiotherapy)\nOutdoor and indoor markets\nAmusement parks and arcades, and indoor and outdoor play centres.\nGalleries, museums, libraries and swimming pools\nGyms, boot camps and indoor sport venues\nPublic playgrounds, outside gyms and skateparks\nHairdressers and barbers can continue but must strictly manage social distancing with at least four square meters per person. Originally a 30-minute time limit per customer was also imposed, but this rule was lifted on the 26 March\nRestaurants and cafes can offer delivery and takeaway only. Food courts in shopping centres may also only offer takeaway\nWeddings restricted to five people \u2013 the couple, the celebrant and two witnesses.\nFunerals are generally limited to no more than 10 people, but on 26 March states and territory were given the power to make exemptions in special circumstances\nVisits to houses are subject to the same rules as public gatherings.\nShopping centres and other shops not specifically told to close, including bottle shops\nMedical centres\nPharmacies\nThe federal government\u2019s advice is that it is safe to send children to school up to the end of the term, but some pupil-free days will be needed to plan distance learning.\nSchools will reopen after the term break with a mix of distance learning and in-school learning for all \u201cessential workers\u201d, defined by the prime minister as anyone with a job.\nThere are differences in how each state and territory is managing schools.\nNSW: Schools remain open but it is up to parents to decide whether to send children to school, and parents have been advised to keep children home unless they need to work.\nQueensland: Schools remain open but it is up to parents to decide whether to send children to school.\nVictoria: Schools closed for school holidays. Due to return on 13 April.\nACT: Schools are pupil-free until the school holidays, but open to students who absolutely need to attend, such as those whose parents must attend work and cannot care for their children at home, as well as vulnerable children and those with additional needs. No child will be turned away.\nTasmania: Schools remain open but up to parents to decide whether to send children.\nNT: Schools to remain open but optional for parents to send children.\nSA: Schools remain open but premier Steven Marshall recognises parents will take children out of school, allowing for increased social distancing.\nWA: Schools remain open but laws relaxed so it\u2019s not compulsory.\nAll states and territories are working towards re-opening in term 2, depending on how the situation changes over the next few weeks.\nThere are no outright bans, although people are advised not to go and some Sydney beaches have been fenced off.\nIt is up to the councils to enforce the outdoor restrictions on social distancing.\nOverseas travel is banned, with some exceptions such as aid workers and compassionate travel.\nArrivals from overseas are subject to compulsory 14-day quarantine in hotels or elsewhere, at public expense, following health checks on arrival at airports.\nNSW, the ACT and Victoria are the only states and territory to not implement restrictions on interstate travel. In the other states and territory anyone visiting will be required to quarantine themselves for 14 days upon arrival, unless they are in sectors deemed essential. Western Australia, South Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland have all closed their borders to a greater or lesser extent. Tasmania has said it will turn around visitors from interstate who do not have an essential purpose to their trip.\nThe restrictions in the Northern Territory do not apply to the remote communities because of the strong restrictions already in place in those communities.",

With no one around to talk to, the only option is to surf the internet in search of nostalgic memories and answers to the unanswerable causes of a catastrophe that has changed the world as we knew it.\nWhen the Austrian author Thomas Glavinic came up with this post-apocalyptic scenario for his harrowing and critically acclaimed 2006 novel Night Work, translated into English by John Brownjohn in 2008, he had no idea how closely it would come to resemble the real world 14 years later.\nAs reality has caught up with fiction, Glavinic may not be the only writer to embark on a work of fiction based on Covid-19, but his is probably the first work in progress already being published. The German newspaper Die Welt has been printing his \u201ccorona novel\u201d in daily instalments.\n\u201cI wanted to capture the mood of this time in history, which we will remember for a very long time,\u201d he told the Guardian.\nThe first eight parts of the yet unnamed work have consisted of a description of his foray to the local pharmacy, a diatribe about the uninterrupted building works in his neighbour\u2019s apartment, and rumination on theology and global finance that reads more like blog entries.\nGlavinic said he planned for the work eventually to take a fictional turn. \u201cIt\u2019s a hybrid of a diary and a novel. Capturing the moment also involves inventing things if they want to be invented.\u201d\nMany of his previous works were written in a seemingly non-literary style only to veer off to explore more existential questions. They include Der Kameram\u00f6rder , or The Camera Killer, a thriller published in 2001 and written in the exacting prose of a legal protocol, and Wie Man Leben Soll , or How One Should Live, a novel published in 2004 in the form of a self-help manual.\n\u201cMy intention with every novel is to create a piece of literature that is written from the heart of our society, but also captures the essence of this society without necessarily being able to put a name to it,\u201d he said.\nGlavinic, who was born in Graz, is approaching the current crisis from an unusual angle not only because he once wrote a book about a similar scenario, but also because he has, by his own account, already spent the last three years living in de facto self-isolation.\n\u201cThree and a half years ago a lot of things happened in my life at the same time. I managed to liberate myself from a long-term addiction to cocaine and alcohol, and I realised that I was a couple of hundred thousand euros in debt,\u201d he said on the phone from his apartment in Vienna.\nThe resulting depression led him increasingly to avoid social contact and hole himself up at home, where he often stayed awake for days on end.\n\u201cIf you are inside a clinical depression, you can\u2019t even write an email or pick up the phone.

        "content": "Canadian Bruce Aylward, who visited Wuhan in February, appeared to hang up or be cut off when pressed on Taipei\u2019s record\nA senior advisor at the World Health Organization (WHO) appeared to hang up on a journalist who asked about Taiwan\u2019s response to the coronavirus pandemic, and then did not answer further questions because they had \u201calready talked about China\u201d.\nIt comes amid continued criticism of the WHO\u2019s approach towards both Taiwan and China. Taiwan has been excluded from participating in the World Health Assembly after heavy lobbying from China, which considers Taiwan part of its territory.\nOn Friday Hong Kong\u2019s RTHK interviewed Dr Bruce Aylward, a Canadian physician and epidemiologist, and former assistant director-general at the WHO, who is now a senior advisor there.\nThe interview, conducted via video-link, was about international responses to the pandemic, and in particular Taiwan\u2019s, where they have recorded a low rate of infection and low rate of fatalities.\nAsked by the RTHK reporter, Yvonne Tong, if the WHO would reconsider Taiwan\u2019s membership, Aylward didn\u2019t respond for several seconds, before saying he couldn\u2019t hear the question.\nTong offered to repeat it but he cut in: \u201cno, that\u2019s OK, let\u2019 move to another one then.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m actually curious to talk about Taiwan as well,\u201d Tong said.\nAylward then appeared to either hang up the call, or get disconnected. RTHK called Aylward back, and Tong asked if he could comment \u201con how Taiwan has done so far in terms of containing the virus\u201d.\nAylward responded: \u201cWell, we\u2019ve already talked about China. And when you look across all the different areas of China, they\u2019ve actually all done quite a good job.\u201d\n\u201cWith that I\u2019d like to thank you very much for inviting us to participate,\u201d he said, ending the conversation.\nOn Sunday the WHO said Aylward \u201cdid not answer a question on Taiwan\u2019s response\u201d but said it was working with Taiwanese health experts. It said questions of membership were up to member states, not WHO staff.\nThe WHO, and in particular its director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, have been accused of being too deferential to China and accepting of China\u2019s claims about the virus outbreak despite evidence it initially covered it up.\nIn February, Aylward, who has decades of experience in battling disease outbreaks, led a WHO mission to Wuhan, several weeks after the pandemic started. After returning he told media the country had \u201cabsolutely turned it around\u201d.\nIn a clip shared by Chinese media, Aylward said the country knew what it was doing and \u201cif I had Covid-19 I\u2019d want to be treated in China,\u201d he said.\nAfter the RTHK interview video went viral, Taiwan\u2019s foreign minister Joseph Wu said the WHO should \u201cset politics aside in dealing with a pandemic\u201d.\n\u201cFYI @WHO, 450+ news reports from 40+ countries so far positively covered #Taiwan\u2019s handling of #COVID19,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThese reports do not mistake us as part of China & #TaiwanCanHelp. JW.\u201d\nWow, can\u2019t even utter \u201cTaiwan\u201d in the WHO? You should set politics aside in dealing with a pandemic. FYI @WHO, 450+ news reports from 40+ countries so far positively covered #Taiwan\u2019s handling of #COVID19. These reports do not mistake us as part of China & #TaiwanCanHelp. JW https://t.co/KbupbUb7NG\nAn account controlled by the Taiwan presidential spokesman said the clip \u201clooks like the WHO has a poor connection with more than just reality\u201d.\nThe Taiwanese government said it has been cut out of discussions despite its success, and claims that it warned the WHO about the risk of human-to-human transmission of a the virus in December, but was ignored.\nThe WHO did not declare a pandemic until March, when the virus had already reached more than 110 countries and infected more than 100,000 people.\nAylward defended the WHO\u2019s response over recent months and his interview with the Pulse, saying it always knew there was the potential it would become a pandemic, but society had the potential to prevent it \u201cif we do the kind of measures that China put in place\u201d.\nHe said any country which failed to do so had to \u201ctake a look at itself\u201d.\nIn the days after the interview aired on 27 March, the WHO removed a biography page from its website that listed Aylward as assistant director-general, sparking claims it was in reaction to the backlash over the interview.\nHowever a spokesman for the WHO told the Guardian it was removed after a request from Aylward\u2019s staff on 27 March to archive it, because he was being misidentified by media. \u201cThe timing was unfortunate as the video interview went viral shortly after this,\u201d the spokesman said.\nThis article was amended on 1 April 2020 to correct Dr Aylward\u2019s job title with the WHO.",

        "content": "Australian Dr Daniel Reardon ended up in hospital after inserting magnets in his nostrils while building a necklace that warns you when you touch your face\nAn Australian astrophysicist has been admitted to hospital after getting four magnets stuck up his nose in an attempt to invent a device that stops people touching their faces during the coronavirus outbreak.\nDr Daniel Reardon, a research fellow at a Melbourne university, was building a necklace that sounds an alarm on facial contact, when the mishap occurred on Thursday night.\nThe 27 year-old astrophysicist, who studies pulsars and gravitational waves, said he was trying to liven up the boredom of self-isolation with the four powerful neodymium magnets.\n\u201cI have some electronic equipment but really no experience or expertise in building circuits or things,\u201d he told Guardian Australia.\n\u201cI had a part that detects magnetic fields. I thought that if I built a circuit that could detect the magnetic field, and we wore magnets on our wrists, then it could set off an alarm if you brought it too close to your face. A bit of boredom in isolation made me think of that.\u201d\nHowever, the academic realised the electronic part he had did the opposite \u2013 and would only complete a circuit when there was no magnetic field present.\n\u201cI accidentally invented a necklace that buzzes continuously unless you move your hand close to your face,\u201d he said.\n\u201cAfter scrapping that idea, I was still a bit bored, playing with the magnets. It\u2019s the same logic as clipping pegs to your ears \u2013 I clipped them to my earlobes and then clipped them to my nostril and things went downhill pretty quickly when I clipped the magnets to my other nostril.\u201d\nReardon said he placed two magnets inside his nostrils, and two on the outside. When he removed the magnets from the outside of his nose, the two inside stuck together. Unfortunately, the researcher then attempted to use his remaining magnets to remove them.\n\u201cAt this point, my partner who works at a hospital was laughing at me,\u201d he said. \u201cI was trying to pull them out but there is a ridge at the bottom of my nose you can\u2019t get past.\n\u201cAfter struggling for 20 minutes, I decided to Google the problem and found an article about an 11-year-old boy who had the same problem. The solution in that was more magnets. To put on the outside to offset the pull from the ones inside.\n\u201cAs I was pulling downwards to try and remove the magnets, they clipped on to each other and I lost my grip. And those two magnets ended up in my left nostril while the other one was in my right. At this point I ran out of magnets.\u201d\nBefore attending the hospital, Reardon attempted to use pliers to pull them out, but they became magnetised by the magnets inside his nose.\n\u201cEvery time I brought the pliers close to my nose, my entire nose would shift towards the pliers and then the pliers would stick to the magnet,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a little bit painful at this point.\n\u201cMy partner took me to the hospital that she works in because she wanted all her colleagues to laugh at me. The doctors thought it was quite funny, making comments like \u2018This is an injury due to self-isolation and boredom.\u2019\u201d\nAt the hospital, a team of two doctors applied an anaesthetic spray and manually removed the magnets from Reardon\u2019s nose.\n\u201cWhen they got the three out from the left nostril, the last one fell down my throat,\u201d he said. \u201cThat could have been a bit of a problem if I swallowed or breathed it in, but I was thankfully able to lean forward and cough it out \u2026 Needless to say I am not going to play with the magnets any more.\u201d\nMedical records from the emergency department said that Reardon did not have difficulty breathing, and denied the presence of further magnets up his nose.\nThe astrophysicist told Guardian Australia he had ruled out further experiments with the magnets and face-touching, and would find other ways to pass the time while at home.\n\u201cI\u2019m actually getting a lot of work done,\u201d he said. \u201cWorking remotely is not that bad. We are also renovating our house, so I am building shelves, making furniture and doing some tiling.\u201d",

The measure will apply to foreign nationals who have been to any of the listed regions within 14 days of arriving in Japan.\nJapanese citizens \u2013 irrespective of where they have travelled to \u2013 and foreigners who have travelled outside the banned areas will be asked to self-quarantine for 14 days and watch for symptoms of Covid-19, Kyodo news agency quoted sources as saying.\nThe government may also ban entry from, and travel to, some countries in south-east Asia and Africa, the Asahi newspaper said, citing a few government sources. Japan has already imposed an entry ban on arrivals from affected areas of China and South Korea, as well as more than 20 countries.\nThe US is now at the centre of the coronavirus pandemic. In a press briefing on Sunday, Donald Trump said it would be \u201ca very good job\u201d if the country could keep deaths to 100,000 after Dr Anthony Fauci, the government\u2019s top infectious diseases expert, said the nation could see 200,000 deaths.\nTrump extended social distancing rules until 30 April and said he hoped normality would return by 1 June. On Sunday New York state passed a grim milestone, recording its 1,000th death.\nThe US president also undermined his plea for unity by uttering falsehoods, verbally abusing reporters and implying health care workers were stealing masks, without providing evidence.\nThe huge rise in cases in the US, and Europe, also prompted South Korea to announce it would require all travellers from overseas to undergo two weeks of quarantine from Wednesday, Yonhap news agency said on Monday. Visitors who were unable to provide an address in the country would be told to stay at government-designated facilities at their own expense, it added.\nOf the 105 new cases reported in the country on Saturday, 41 involved people arriving overseas: 23 from Europe, 14 from the Americas and four from unidentified Asian countries. The number of new cases announced on Sunday fell to 78, according to the Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.\nIn Japan, Tokyo recorded its biggest daily increase in Covid-19 cases on Sunday, as authorities identified large infection clusters in and around the capital.\nThe additional 68 cases brings the city\u2019s total to 430 \u2013 by far the highest among Japan\u2019s 47 prefectures. The newly identified infections included 27 at a hospital where 96 people are now known to have been infected.\nIn addition, 88 cases have been found among staff and residents at a facility for people with intellectual disabilities in Chiba prefecture, east of the capital.\nThe outbreak has infected more than 1,800 people in Japan, with 55 deaths as of Sunday afternoon, excluding 712 cases and 10 deaths from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which was quarantined in Yokohama last month.\nThe virus claimed its first high-profile victim there, with public broadcaster NHK reporting on Monday that Ken Shimura, a 70-year-old veteran comedian and TV personality, had died on Sunday after being hospitalised earlier this month. His death would \u201craise public awareness\u201d of just how serious the virus was, Shigeru Ishiba, a veteran lawmaker in the ruling Liberal Democratic party, told reporters on Monday.\nA recent rise in cases in Tokyo, including some with no known source of infection, has raised speculation that the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, is considering declaring a three-week state of emergency from Wednesday \u2013 a measure that would enable the governors of affected prefectures to instruct residents not to leave their homes except to shop for food and to receive medical care.\nIn other developments around the world:\nChina reported a drop in new cases for the fourth consecutive day on Sunday, as Beijing seeks to stamp out the risk of a second wave of infections by shutting its borders to foreign travellers and cutting international flights.\nAustralia was preparing for new rules that including limiting both indoor and outdoor gatherings to two people only.\nA senior WHO adviser appeared to hang up after being asked about Taiwan\u2019s response to the pandemic, and then did not answer further questions because they had \u201calready talked about China\u201d.\nArgentina extended its quarantine until mid-April.\nIndian doctors are being ostracised from communities and evicted from their homes over fears they may be carrying the virus.\nThe stricken Zaandam cruise liner and its sister ship will start crossing the Panama canal on Monday night. The number of people with flu-like-symptoms on a Covid-19 stricken cruise ship off the coast of Panama has risen by almost a third in two days, from 138 to 179.\nThe coronavirus pandemic could cause UK economic output to plunge by an unprecedented 15% in the second quarter of the year and unemployment to more than double, according to dire forecasts.\nIn the US, the singer-songwriter John Prine is critically ill and has been placed on a ventilator while being treated for Covid-19-type symptoms.",

She had been recruiting new marshals to help rescue vulnerable toads during this year\u2019s run.\nPatchett has done toad patrolling in Riddlesden for 15 years. \u201cI used to do it by myself but five years ago I formed a group and there\u2019s now approximately 10 to 15 of us,\u201d she said.\n\u201cEvery spring when darkness falls, hundreds of toads embark on their migration down from gardens on the hillside in Riddlesden and they head downwards towards the canal.\n\u201cMany are killed and injured on the streets but we\u2019re dedicated to helping by going out with torches and buckets to collect up as many toads as we can find and we release them by their breeding ground. We can save over 1,000 toads in season.\u201d\nPatchett blames the annual bunny runs for hundreds of toads being trampled and killed.\nBut Steve Milner from the Wharfedale Warriors, who helps to plan and organise the runs, said: \u201cI haven\u2019t ever seen any evidence of it, of toads being trampled.\n\u201cI\u2019ve spoken to a lot of people from the race and no one has ever said they\u2019ve seen anything. The location is also a very popular place where people walk as well.\u201d\nResident Jo Edwards, however, said she saw hundreds of dead toads while walking close to the pond the morning after one of the bunny runs.\n\u201cWe witnessed dozens and dozens and dozens of trampled toads,\u201d she said. \u201cThey were either dead or still dying and they all had their innards spilling out. There were so many of them. It was absolutely heartbreaking to see.\u201d\nEdwards has, in the past, taken part in the bunny runs and says the \u201cfast and furious\u201d route often leads to runners using the path closest to the pond where the toads congregate. \u201cThe ground\u2019s uneven and it\u2019s rocky,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re running, it\u2019s hard to avoid things \u2013 you\u2019ve just to place your feet where they land.\u201d\nPatchett has asked Bradford council if the location of the runs can be changed. A council spokesperson said: \u201cThese races have run for many years and this is the first time we\u2019ve been approached about the issue.\u201d\nAt the time, the council granted permission for the evening runs to take place as long as they were rerouted.\nMilner said the Wharfedale Harriers made plans to adjust the route but Patchett said the best solution would be for the runs to be held during the daytime or later in the year.",

It means for him to keep it, he has to commute via New York City transit every day, which is obviously risky now.\nAll my jobs have gone online, so I can stay home to be with our two kids, whose elementary school closed down last Monday. But this has an impact on my work. I already work on weekends and late at night and early in the morning, and also all the hours my kids are in school \u2013 I usually read between 700 and 1,000 pages of student work and books in order to teach in any single week. I manage to write as well. It has always been a lot, but I have gotten it done. Now, for maybe the first time, I do not see how I can. There are only so many weekend and early morning hours. How long can I keep this up?\nI\u2019ve been putting everything on the credit card and trying not to think about it. The panic buying I did a few weeks ago \u2013 all that food that I thought would last a month \u2013 is already gone. Snacks are perhaps the most reliable distraction when you\u2019re homebound, especially with children. We ate an entire loaf of the six-dollar challah that I\u2019d bought the children as a treat meant to be split up over days in a single afternoon. I sat idly eating from the jar of peanut butter during our \u201cmath lesson\u201d on Monday, only to panic when I realized that the peanut butter was almost gone. I ate the last bar of emergency chocolate I\u2019d bought myself last night, anxious about the schools closing, and sad, as a former NYC high school teacher, about all the kids I knew who would lose so much now that they didn\u2019t have their schools.\nWe were on a walk last weekend and our older daughter had to go to the bathroom so we went into a nearly empty bar by our apartment. All the servers were standing by the bar talking about the virus. I was a waitress for a long time, and, though I\u2019m trying to do my part to social distance, I wished that I could sidle up close to them and tell them how sorry and how scared for them I am. I remember the bone-deep fear of a patio shift on a Sunday when it rained unexpectedly and a day that was supposed to provide a sixth of my rent suddenly resulted in $20. I don\u2019t need to remember those years because I\u2019m still living them. Just two years ago \u2013 as a mother of two and the sole provider for my family \u2013 I was told my boss was stepping down and her replacement might not ask me back the next semester. That quick stop into the bar was a tangible reminder of how precarious my finances have been and continue to be.\nThe title of this column is Two in Five, because that\u2019s the percentage of Americans who couldn\u2019t come up with $400 in an emergency. That\u2019s one good brunch shift as a server in New York City; 20 hours of childcare in Brooklyn; a third of a six-week teaching gig at a community organization; half a column at a major publication; one quarter of my biweekly pay at my most well-paid adjunct job. Maybe I\u2019m more used to being scared than people who don\u2019t do gig work; my life has been precarious for years. But also, I\u2019m used to being one of the people bailouts and an economy on the upswing doesn\u2019t touch. That $1.5tn dollars injected into the stock market, payroll tax cuts \u2013 these have nothing to do with our lives or our precariousness.\nOne bad week or one lost job or cancelled shift \u2013 not to mention a pandemic \u2013 is all it takes to push us backwards. I know better than to think anyone will come and save us, better than to think our landlords will give us a break, that our ability to access healthcare or childcare won\u2019t just disappear. And now, we\u2019re staring down not weeks, but months, of this.\nTwo in five of us live in constant fear of when one single catastrophe destroys us, debilitates us, gets us behind on rent or forces us to have to cancel some service or essential thing that only feels expendable now that we have no choice. We already felt, almost always, like we were one stroke shy of drowning, and now the emergency is here, it\u2019s both invisible and unrelenting \u2013 there is no end in sight. It\u2019s hit all of us at once.",

Built in the Andes at 2,430 metres above sea level around AD1450, Machu Picchu was created without wheels or animals to transport the huge stones up the mountainside. A series of 360-degree images on YouVisit\u2019s virtual tour explore various areas of the site. The tour also includes a voiceover guide with information on the architecture, history and resident alpacas. For a bird\u2019s-eye view, head to Air Pano for stunning interactive images, including from the summit of Machu Picchu mountain. \n Guardian Travel\u2019s Will Coldwell accompanied the Google Trekker team when they mapped Machu Picchu in 2015\nStanding 30 metres tall on the summit of the 710-metre Corcovado mountain and visible from all over Rio, Christ the Redeemer is the world\u2019s largest art deco statue. As with some other entries on this list, this tour on Google Arts and Culture uses the Street View technology to allow visitors to \u201cwalk around\u201d the site. As the sun sets behind misty clouds, the view from the end of the platform walkway looks out across the city, including Ipanema and Copacabana beaches and Sugarloaf Mountain, which is dwarfed from this great height. Or check it out at different times of day, with these 360-degree shots from above.\nOn the edge of the desert where the sand ends and modern Cairo begins, the pyramids of Giza were constructed around 4,500 years ago as grand tombs for the pharaohs. With walking routes around the site, this virtual tour shows the magnificent structures from near and far. This includes two of the largest pyramids ever built \u2013 the Great Pyramid (147 metres) and the Pyramid of Khafre (136 metres) \u2013 plus the Great Sphinx to the east.\nSee one of the world\u2019s most visited monuments on this interactive tour, which takes travellers up to the viewing platform of the 324-metre tower \u2013 give or take 18cm, which is how much the iron contracts and expands by \u2013 depending on the ambient temperature. Additional immersive digital exhibitions explore its construction, from 1887-89, with photos of the first glamorous Parisian visitors. There are also 360-degree shots showing a helicopter\u2019s view of the tower against the city skyline.\nAngkor Wat, \u201cthe city of temples\u201d, is the largest religious monument in the world, originally built as a Hindu temple complex dedicated to the god Vishnu in the first half of the 12th century, but gradually transformed into the centre of worship for Buddhism in the latter part of the same century. This virtual tour explores several of the magical temples, including the five towers of Angkor Wat itself; the pink sandstone Banteay Srei; and Ta Prohm (as seen in the 2001 film Lara Croft: Tomb Raider), where nature has reclaimed the ruins. For a glimpse of the living city as it would have been in the 13th century, the Virtual Angkor project includes 360-degree video simulations created collaboratively by archaeologists, historians and CGI artists.\nBuilt as the resting place for his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal, by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan, this symbol of eternal love is considered one of the most beautiful buildings ever created. The 17th-century white marble \u201ccrown of palaces\u201d in Agra, north India, combines Persian, Islamic and Indian architectural styles and took 22 years to complete. The interactive digital pathways include routes around the mausoleum itself, reflecting pool, paradise gardens and ornate red sandstone mosque. Aerial 360-degree images soar above the lotus-topped dome and minarets for a view over the Yamuna River.\nThe prehistoric site of Stonehenge in Wiltshire dates back 5,000 years. It was originally a simple earth enclosure used for cremations, with the ring of standing stones added around 2500BC. The stones include large sarsen blocks that archaeologists believe were brought to the site from Marlborough Downs (20 miles away) and smaller bluestones from Preseli Hills in Wales, a confounding 140 miles away. The English Heritage virtual tour includes a 360-degree interactive image from the centre of the site, with pop-out videos on its excavation, conservation and design, including as a site for celestial observation. Other interactive CGI images give more information on its construction and the landscape at different periods in its history.\nOne of the oldest cities in the world, Petra was occupied thousands of years BC, though it is believed the spectacular sandstone city was built in the 3rd century BC by the Nabatean Arabs. It\u2019s rose-coloured buildings have been viewed by the world in films such as The Mummy Returns and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, though around 85% of the city remains underground, yet to be excavated. This online tour includes a guide narrating the interactive walk around some of Petra\u2019s most iconic monuments. It heads through a narrow gorge called the Siq, passing tombs, temple ruins, an enormous monastery and Al Khaznah, the famous building whose elaborate facade is carved into the gorge wall.\nOnce seating between 50,000 and 80,000 spectators who came through 80 entrances, the Colosseum was the world\u2019s largest amphitheatre when it was built between AD70 and AD80 for sporting events and gladiatorial combat. Around two-thirds of the structure has been destroyed in the 2,000 years since but the remaining ruins are one of Italy\u2019s most popular attractions. Take a walk inside, around the various levels, or fly overhead in these 360-degree images.\nThere are many strange and wonderful architectural features within the ancient city of Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 on Mexico\u2019s Yucat\u00e1n peninsula. El Castillo pyramid (also known as the Temple of Kukulcan, a serpent deity) at the centre has a combined 365 steps ascending its four sides. Twice a year, on the equinox, the steps cast a shadow in the shape of a serpent on the north section, which connects to a snake head sculpture at its base, meant to depict Kukulkan. The 360- aerial images explore several of the Mayan ruins, including the pyramid, the Temple of Warriors, the observatory and the nunnery.",

I\u2019m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories this morning.\nPressure is mounting on ministers to speed up the provision of protective equipment amid fears among NHS staff that they risk catching coronavirus and spreading it to the public at large. As two surgeons became the first doctors to die from the disease in Britain, staff lobby groups attacked continuing shortages of gear such as masks and gowns and there were more calls for increased testing of workers. The UK\u2019s death toll rose to 1,228 over the weekend and Jenny Harries, deputy chief medical officer, said restrictions on everyday life could last for six months. Cabin crew staff laid off by airlines could be retrained to work in emergency hospitals to help ease personnel shortages.\nThe coronavirus emergency is expected to reduce UK economic output by a whopping 15%, according to the Centre for Economics and Business Research. The unprecedented fall would dwarf the 2.2% reduction seen during the 2008-09 financial crisis. Among the worst-hit sectors will be pubs, shops and restaurants, where thousands of businesses could collapse because of the lockdown rules.\nDonald Trump has extended the US lockdown to the end of April after bowing to pressure from medical experts not to try to open up parts of the economy by Easter. He also said that keeping US deaths at 100,000 would be a \u201cvery good job\u201d hours after administration expert Anthony Fauci said 200,000 Americans could die. Meanwhile New York passed the grim milestone of 1,000 deaths.\nAround the world, almost 34,000 people have died from Covid-19 and 720,000 have been infected. Here is our latest at-a-glance summary and we will have all the developments throughout the day on our coronavirus live blog.\nThere\u2019s more in our Coronavirus Extra section further down \u2026 and here\u2019s where you can find all our coverage of the outbreak \u2013 from breaking news to factchecks and advice.\nStudent cap \u2013 University admissions will be capped this year in order to avoid a free-for-all which could leave some institutions without enough students as the coronavirus wreaks chaos in the higher education sector. It will be the first time numbers have been capped since 2015. The move is designed to offset the expected fall in overseas students, which it is feared could lead to certain universities taking more domestic candidates and leaving other, less prestigious ones with empty lecture theatres.\nSussex security \u2013 The United States will not pay for security for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex after they reportedly moved to California, Donald Trump said on Sunday night. Harry and Meghan are believed to have left Vancouver in Canada for US before the border closed between the two countries last week. Trump tweeted that he was \u201ca great friend and admirer of the Queen and the UK\u201d but his government would not pay for the security costs. The couple denied they had asked the US for help and said they would be footing their own bill.\nToads saved \u2013 The cancellation of fell running races in Yorkshire will likely save hundreds of migrating toads from being squashed underfoot. A toad protection group said hundreds of the creatures have been trampled by fell runners in previous years because the popular \u201cbunny runs\u201d hosted by the Wharfedale Harriers every April take place close to a pond where the toads mate.\nJapan and South Korea are extending their entry bans amid a continued spread of the virus. Vietnam has told its biggest cities to prepare for lockdown. Worshippers ignored social distancing advice on Sunday to attend church services from Moscow to Rio on Sunday. In Ireland, the vast majority of people appeared to be obeying the lockdown laws, turning the country\u2019s cities into ghost towns. A growing number of doctors and medical staff in India are being forced to sleep in hospitals after being ostracised by their communities for fear they are carrying the disease.\nJohn Prine, the celebrated American singer-songwriter, is critically ill with coronavirus-like symptoms, his family said. Prine, who has suffered poor health in recent years, was hospitalised on Thursday in Nashville and is now on a ventilator.\nAnd, on a lighter note, an astrophysicist in Australia had to be admitted to hospital after getting two magnets stuck up his nose while trying to invent a device to warn people to stop touching their face.\nSir Keir Starmer began his career as a barrister before rising to become the director of public prosecutions. But since his entry into parliament in 2015, he has risen quickly up the ranks to the shadow cabinet\u2019s frontbench. He tells Anushka Asthana why he wants to become Labour leader this week.\nSorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen $https://audio.guim.co.uk/2020/03/27-73081-200330TIFstarmer.mp3\nWe could all be forgiven for thinking that we\u2019re never going to be able to go on holiday again. So while we\u2019re in lockdown, check out this virtual guide to some of the world\u2019s most popular destinations. You can visit places from Angkor Wat in Cambodia to Petra in Jordan for that perfect vicarious travel experience.\nSebastian Coe has said the postponement of the Olympics was necessary in order to safeguard the psychological wellbeing of athletes because many were in \u201cmental turmoil\u201d not knowing if the Tokyo Games were to proceed as scheduled. Harry Kane has revealed he will not simply stay at Tottenham \u201cfor the sake of it\u201d and would consider his Spurs future if the north London club stopped progressing. An investigation has been launched after pictures of the Aston Villa midfielder Jack Grealish surfaced online following an incident in which a Range Rover crashed into parked cars. The England and Wales Cricket Board is preparing to unveil an emergency financial package to support the game during the costly delay to the season but pay cuts for centrally contracted players are not being discussed. And Henrik Stenson, the former Open champion whose coach has tested positive for coronavirus, says it may be some time before he is back on the golf course.\nMorrisons, the UK\u2019s largest fresh food producer, will ramp up production and donate \u00a310m worth of provisions to food banks across the country. The supermarket chain will increase output of its bakery, egg and fruit and vegetable packing site by an extra hour every day. Asian markets were mostly down again overnight but the FTSE100 is set to open up slightly. The pound is on $1.237 and \u20ac1.117.\nThe mounting threat to NHS staff is the lead for many today with the Guardian headline reading \u201cPressure to provide equipment grows after two UK doctors die\u201d over a picture of Amged El-Hawrani, one of the doctors to die from Covid-19 this weekend. The Mirror says \u201cNHS hero\u2019s death on the front line\u201d, the i has \u201cNew NHS field hospital ready within days\u201d and the Metro compares El-Harwani\u2019s death to the party closed down by police in Derbyshire: \u201cHe gave his life \u2026 they had a party\u201d.\nThe Times has the same picture but focuses on \u201cBritain faces 6 months of curbs\u201d, as does the Telegraph \u2013 \u201cReturn to \u2018normal life\u2019 may be six months away\u201d \u2013 and the Express \u2013 \u201c6 months for Britain to get back to normal\u201d.

Other groups, including teenagers, were also not being reached because of the way information was being distributed.\nThe West Midlands has emerged as a hotspot for transmissions and deaths from the virus. Earlier this week, the government said it was investigating anecdotal evidence suggesting people\u2019s religious convictions and fears of social isolation could be leading to a sharp rise in the number of coronavirus transmissions in the area.\nIn an interview with the Guardian, the Birmingham MP Khalid Mahmood said older Muslim and Sikh people in the area were struggling to adhere to government guidelines about physical distancing because of their religious beliefs.\nNow it is emerging that language issues could also be resulting in spikes in certain areas, with certain communities and age groups not fully understanding the new government guidelines and rules surrounding social distancing.\nJamieson, a former Labour MP for Plymouth Devonport, said: \u201cThe local news and newspapers attract a certain audience. There are definitely people out there who are not understanding completely what is going on.\n\u201cThe government need to be more inventive in their approach. There are some households where no English is spoken, so the government needs to make sure they reach out to them.\n\u201cTeenagers are also another group that might be struggling to get the right information \u2013 they don\u2019t watch the news or read the papers \u2013 so we need to use social media to make sure they are understanding the message.\u201d\nA month ago, amid growing concern around the world about the pace of the virus\u2019s spread, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said the government would launch a mass public information campaign giving advice on how to react to suspected cases and guard against infection.\nAt the time, a Whitehall source told the Guardian: \u201cIt\u2019s as much about winning the battle for public confidence as it is about winning the battle against the disease. There will be social media, stuff on TV, poster campaigns. It will be making sure we can reach as many people as possible.\n\u201cIt\u2019s making sure that people have got the right advice. At the moment it is very much about telling people to ring 111 \u2026 It will be about what people can do to help prevent the spread, like handwashing and using tissues.\u201d\nSince then the government\u2019s public information campaign has included advice from Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, appearing in a public advert urging all to stay home and to leave the house only for essentials. Information has also been made available on most government and NHS websites.\nHowever, Jamieson argues that more needs to be done. \u201cWe have always taken a hands-on approach in the West Midlands as we have many different communities all living together and we need to make sure we reach those on the fringes. The government needs to do the same.\u201d\nA government spokesperson said: \u201cThe coronavirus outbreak is the biggest health emergency in a generation.\n\u201cThat is why we are using public health campaigns, daily media briefings, Facebook and Instagram adverts, and clear guidance on gov.uk to provide the public with the information it needs to fulfil its critical role in helping delay the spread of coronavirus.\n\u201cSince the beginning of February, our public information campaigns have reached an estimated 95% of adults an average of 17 times, and have been running across platforms including digital and social, TV, radio, press and out of home.\u201d",

        "content": "UK prime minister\u2019s refusal to criticise Amazon fires and sharp rise in deforestation praised by Brazilian ambassador \nBoris Johnson was personally thanked by the Brazilian government for refusing to support European action over the Amazon fires, according to documents obtained by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism.\nAs the rainforest burned last summer \u2013 fuelled by a sharp rise in deforestation that critics blame partly on President Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s agenda \u2013 Johnson criticised a threat by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, to block the EU\u2019s Mercosur trade deal with Brazil.\nSpeaking in Biarritz before the G7 summit in August, Johnson described the fires as a \u201ctragedy\u201d but called Macron\u2019s threat an excuse to interfere with free trade. Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, had already given his support to Macron\u2019s proposal.\nDays after the G7, the Brazilian ambassador \u201cthanked the prime minister for his stance at Biarritz, and said it had not gone unnoticed in Brasilia\u201d, according to documents released to the Bureau through a freedom of information request.\nEd Davey, acting co-leader of the Liberal Democrats, said he was astounded at the revelation, especially as the UK is due to host the Cop26 global climate negotiations later this year. \u201cAny remaining credibility Boris Johnson has on climate is now gone,\u201d he said.\n\u201cFor the British prime minister to cosy up to one of the world\u2019s leading climate deniers, and protect President Bolsonaro from international reaction to his destruction of the Amazon rainforest, just beggars belief.\u201d\nBarry Gardiner, Labour\u2019s shadow international trade secretary, called on Johnson to rethink his approach. \u201cOur government has refused to challenge President Bolsonaro over his policy measures, which are directly responsible for encouraging some of the worst forest fires ever seen and the mass displacement of indigenous peoples,\u201d he said. \u201cThey should be showing leadership, not endorsing a regime that is responsible for some of the most climate-damaging policies of our time.\u201d\nBrazil wants a trade deal between South American countries and a post-Brexit UK, similar to the Mercosur agreement. Politicians and campaigners have expressed concern that the Mercosur deal could put the Amazon at risk by boosting imports of products that fuel deforestation, such as beef, soya beans and timber. Opposition parties in the UK have called for guarantees that any future UK-Brazil trade deal would not contribute to the destruction of the Amazon.\nPreserving the rainforest is critical in the fight against the climate crisis. Scientists say large-scale felling means the Amazon could reach a \u201ctipping point\u201d within a decade, after which much of it would collapse into a dry savannah that would emit more carbon than it absorbed.\nThe vast majority of the Amazon basin sits in Brazil, where deforestation rose by 30% last year. About 17% of the entire biome has been felled; the tipping point will be reached at 20-25%, according to one estimate.\nCaroline Lucas, the former Green party leader, said: \u201cThe hypocrisy of Johnson\u2019s self-proclaimed leadership on climate is staggering.\n\u201cWe should be using trade deals to try to drive up environmental protection and climate action around the world, not give a nod and a wink to Bolsonaro\u2019s destruction of the rainforest.\u201d\nEvery year up to 5,800 sq km of forest \u2014 an area four times the size of Greater London \u2014 is being felled in the Amazon and other protected areas to be converted into pasture for cattle farming, according to research by Trase, a supply chain transparency initiative.\nCampaign groups including WWF are calling for a commitment to a \u201cdue diligence\u201d clause to be added to the government\u2019s environment bill, which would require British companies to assess the environmental impacts of their global supply chains and report on their progress in eradicating them.\nMike Barrett of WWF said: \u201cAs the UK negotiates new trade deals, we must insist on the highest environmental standards to protect people and the planet \u2013 including removing deforestation from our supply chains.\u201d\nShortly after Johnson\u2019s pronouncement in Biarritz, the Brazilian government accepted \u00a310m from the UK to fund existing anti-deforestation projects, having rejected similar offers from other countries. Lucas said this amounted to \u201cpretending to show concern\u201d.\n The UK government declined to comment when approached.",

        "content": "With the country in lockdown because of coronavirus, deep social inequalities have been exposed more sharply than ever\n\u201cSauvignon blanc or viognier\u201d? As the words left my mouth, my son and I locked eyes, our expressions flashing from shame-faced to half laughing at the irony. My live-in maid Ranjita had just laid out dinner and, since the fish and lyonnaise potatoes looked appetising, I thought it deserved a bottle of wine.\nFor people like us, under lockdown, the existential questions that punctuate our daily lives are: is it to be Curb Your Enthusiasm or Line of Duty, Netflix or Hotstar?\nFor millions of rich and middle-class people in India, the lockdown is almost an enforced period of recreation or a chance for self-improvement. Time to enrol for an online art appreciation course, learn the intricacies of Thai cooking, take up gardening, learn a language, take up the guitar, go for a detox by eating healthy food.\nIt\u2019s a good time to start War and Peace. Watch those Visconti classics. Or finish Proust\u2019s \u00c0 La Recherche du Temps Perdu, or rather just the first volume. It requires several lockdowns to finish the whole novel.\nIf, like me, you have a live-in maid who happens to have picked up some beautician skills, you are \u201ccondemned\u201d to confinement in a spa. Shall I have a facial today? Or a pedicure? No, let\u2019s settle for a massage. It will relieve my lockdown tension.\nThe fridge is well stocked with food. Not, I hasten to add, because I have hoarded \u2013 I very deliberately refused to do something so cheap \u2013 but because Ranjita happened to do a big shop just a few days before Narendra Modi announced a nationwide lockdown. There is more wine, along with single malt, vodka and rum.\nI have some money in the bank. I even have cash because my sister, when she left India after a holiday to return to Oxford (she caught literally the last flight out of the country before flights to and from India were stopped), paid me for the new ticket we had to book to get her home. Hell, I\u2019m even able to earn some money sitting indoors, if this article gets published.\nWhat the lockdown has done, just two days in, is to magnify a hundredfold the social inequality in India until you feel as though it is screaming at you, wild-eyed and with bared teeth.\nSocial inequality has always been extreme here. Nothing new about that. Waiting at the traffic lights in your air-conditioned car (a kind of gleaming sealed egg, as novelist Aravind Adiga puts it in White Tiger), in your nice fresh clothes on your way to meet a friend for lunch at an elegant restaurant that is going to cost what could feed a family of four for a month, a man comes up to the window selling slices of coconut or crisps and the 250 rupees (\u00a32.71) that he earns in a day will go towards feeding his family, if he is lucky.\nWith the lockdown, the man at the traffic lights has been immobilised. The lives of millions and millions of Indians are being shattered by the lockdown to an unimaginable degree and the contrast between their suffering and those who can comfortably ride out this storm is so sharp that it provokes an intake of breath. In Europe and the US where societies are more egalitarian, the lockdown experience is not marked by the same sharp disparities as in India.\nWe are staying indoors, all cosy and cocooned in our nice spacious homes with sofas and lamps, snug as a bug in a rug and busy on our laptops and phones, safe and protected. The poor have been thrown to the wolves. The government is doing its best to offer relief to help them survive but they are in extremis in every single respect: no work, money or food and, in many cases no family around for affection and support.\nCasual workers are paid by the day. If they don\u2019t work for a day, their wallets are empty. The first thing you notice when you walk into the home of a poor Indian is the absence of any processed or packaged foods. There are no jars, packets, bottles or boxes, nothing that can last. No packet of biscuits or noodles or a can of beans. There is never enough money to buy these superfluous items; the money is enough only for the vegetables or dal needed for one meal, and even the quantity of that meal is carefully calibrated to appetite as there is no fridge to keep any leftovers.\nIf they need medicines, they ask the chemist for the number of pills \u2013 paracetamol, say \u2013 they need for that day rather than buying a strip.\nThe crucial difference is that the poor have no buffer, no reserves of anything, whether money, food or medicines. Life is lived on the edge. While we can talk with our loved ones in other cities or countries on video calls or Facetime, they won\u2019t have smartphones or won\u2019t have the money to pay for packages with enough bandwidth.\nThe lockdown is necessary, no doubt, but it is a catastrophe for poor Indians. Some families at least live together in urban slums, but millions of migrant labourers are separated from their wives, parents and children back in the village. Lockdown means being confined to dingy cells that pass for rented accommodation, usually shared with six or seven other labourers.\nIn pre-Covid-19 days, they could spend some time outside these cells, chatting with others on the stairs or landings of their tenements, inhaling some of Delhi\u2019s particulate matter. Now social distancing has made even that impossible.\nFormer maid Pushpa used to spend the day with her toddler in a tiny rented room while her husband and in-laws went out to work. Now all of them are locked up in that one room 24/7.\nThe lockdown has stripped the poor of the one thing that allowed them to hang on to a shred of dignity: work. When a poor Indian saw a rich man rushing off to work in his car, getting busy to support his family, he could feel that he too was working to be able to put food on the table that evening for his children. The lockdown has taken away this function and rendered him truly helpless.\nWeirdest of all, none of this suffering is visible. Homebound as the rich are, the poor have become truly invisible, apart from the images on the news and in the papers. They have been walled off. And yet you can feel it. In one passage, Proust talks of how, as a child, he could experience the summer heat outside more intensely and vividly, lying inside his darkened bedroom, than he could if he had been outside in the bright sunshine. That is what some of us are feeling now, safe inside our homes while the suffering happens outside somewhere.\nAnd yet \u2026 yet, true to habit, trivial thoughts keep intruding. What if I can\u2019t get any hair dye? I don\u2019t want to emerge from the lockdown looking like a badger.",

        "content": "Neal Maxwell wants trade to go from 50,000 tonnes of plastic waste each year to zero by 2040\nA builder from Merseyside has launched a project that aims to remove plastic from the British construction industry within two decades.\nNeal Maxwell, who has worked in the trade for more than 30 years, co-founded the non-profit organisation Changing Streams after a trip to the Arctic.\nAppalled by the levels of plastic pollutants in the Arctic Ocean and the often-lethal impact on animals in the polar region, Maxwell and researchers from the University of Liverpool have drawn up a programme that they say could make construction plastic-free by 2040.\nThe sector is the second largest producer of plastic waste in the UK, after packaging. It is estimated the building trade generates 50,000 tonnes of plastic waste each year.\nAlong with the architect Dr Gareth Abrahams from the university\u2019s School of Environmental Science, Maxwell has drafted a charter that they hope could become legally binding.\nThe programme for the construction indusry includes:\n the phasing out of paint containing plastic;\n the establishment of a \u201ctraffic light\u201d guide to warn which paints contain plastic to dissuade DIY consumers from buying them;\n the creation of a template house made without plastic;\n the end of the use of plastic wrapping for building materials such as bricks and cladding.\nMaxwell co-founded Changing Streams in 2018 after he and his wife toured the Arctic on a scientific exploration ship. He said: \u201cOn board were 20 scientific specialists from all around the world who helped us understand about the environment and the impact global warming and plastic pollution was having.\n\u201cWe were told about the walruses while out in kayaks and learned about their feeding habits and plastic ingestion via clams when in the water. But the moment of truth for me came when we got back to England, when I went on our first food shop at the supermarket to stock up the kitchen again. When I saw row upon row of things covered in plastic it turned my stomach \u2013 I had to get out of the shop.\n\u201cWhen I got home I realised I had to do something about plastic pollution. And I could only do that in the industry I\u2019ve worked in for over 30 years. That trip and that moment in the supermarket afterwards convinced me that I should try to make my industry plastic-free.\u201d\nMaxwell said he was even more shocked when he discovered how much plastic was used in the construction business.\nHe and Abrahams hope a \u201ccarrot and stick\u201d approach can win over builders, many of whom fear replacing plastic will raise their costs.\n\u201cWe will not only ask government eventually to adopt this as legally binding regulations, but also petition large pension fund providers which finance construction to adopt the charter as well,\u201d Maxwell said.\nAbrahams says the University of Liverpool aims to construct plastic-free accommodation on its campus, which is undergoing a multimillion-pound rebuild.\nHe said: \u201cOne of our projects is to create the first ever plastic-neutral commercially viable house. We want to show the building industry this can be done. And through things like coding paint we can hopefully change consumer behaviour as well.\u201d\nMaxwell says plastic became widely used in the late 1950s and 60s. \u201cWhat did we do before [it] was ubiquitous? Pre-plastic, we built houses, factories, offices and buildings without it. We don\u2019t have to reinvent the wheel here. There are alternatives we have used before and new ones we can invent.\n\u201cWe used to use asbestos throughout our industry before we knew the damage it was doing to our lungs. We know the damage plastic is doing to our planet and other species. Shouldn\u2019t we treat plastic as the new asbestos?\u201d",

        "content": "People placed in hotels to self-isolate for 14 days as part of a government effort to contain coronavirus say they are not being permitted to leave rooms or open windows\nDinner at the five-star InterContinental hotel in Sydney is a plastic container of \u201cunidentifiable food\u201d. The sauce is lukewarm but chunks of meat are still frozen inside.\nFor Paula Lemmon, who has multiple serious food allergies, two small containers of chopped tomato and cucumber are the only meals she has been able to eat in almost 24 hours since arriving back in Australia and being placed in hotel quarantine.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a few comments that it\u2019s a five-star hotel and people shouldn\u2019t be complaining,\u201d Paula\u2019s daughter, Olivia, told Guardian Australia. \u201cWe completely understand travellers are a high risk \u2013 we are 100% for quarantining. We\u2019d be happy to be in a caravan.\n\u201cBut we\u2019re not staying at a five-star hotel, we\u2019re staying at a government-run quarantine centre and we\u2019re not getting basic needs.\u201d\nSimilar stories are emerging in Sydney and elsewhere as Australians returning from overseas are put into an enforced 14-day quarantine in city hotels. People say they are not permitted to leave rooms or open windows.\nOlivia, her partner Chloe Steffensen and mother Paula arrived in Australia early on Sunday morning. Paula had been visiting Olivia and Chloe, both vets working in the UK, when the coronavirus outbreak worsened.\nWhen they arrived in Sydney, they were put on buses with other travellers and kept onboard for about three hours.\nSince arriving about 1.30pm on Sunday, the only food available has been the meals supplied by the hotel.\n\u201cWhen the food arrives it is vacuum-sealed, unidentified food,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cIt\u2019s really, really bad. It\u2019s been heated up, you can feel that it\u2019s warm but all the chunks of meat were cold.\u201d\nEach time food has been delivered, no allowance has been made for Paula\u2019s dietary requirements.\n\u201cWhen we tell the hotel she cannot eat the food, they just send up cucumber and tomato for Mum. She\u2019s literally starving. And I know that sounds very over the top, but she got off the plane yesterday morning and all she\u2019s been offered since is cucumber and tomato.\u201d\nFor breakfast on Monday, they were given a bread roll, a small croissant and a container of porridge to share between three.\nA friend has offered to cook meals and deliver them to the hotel, but no deliveries have been allowed.\n\u201cThe hotel manager said: \u2018You have to realise you\u2019re not staying in a hotel, the hotel is shut, you don\u2019t have the services of a hotel,\u2019\u201d Olivia said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re all for the quarantine, but the way we\u2019ve been treated has been worse than criminals. We asked if we can have some fresh air. We have windows but they don\u2019t open and we\u2019re not allowed to leave the room.\n\u201cWe need to know who is in control at the moment. The staff are just doing what they\u2019re told. Even the manager said he was in no position to change any of the rules that were in place. It\u2019s fine to keep us here but we need our basic human rights respected.\u201d\nThe InterContinental Sydney general manager, Jennifer Brown, said in a statement the government had put in place \u201cextremely strict rules around the way we operate \u2026 and these will inevitably have some impact on the quality of service delivered\u201d.\n\u201cIt includes a requirement that only three meals are delivered a day, medication and baby formula may be delivered to guests, and nothing else. Let me assure you that every guest staying at InterContinental Sydney has received their three meals per day since they arrived, and that all dietary requirements have been accounted for.\u201d\nHowever, people sent to other Sydney hotels said they had been allowed deliveries from friends, and to order food from hotel restaurant menus.\nOne woman who landed in Australia after eight years living in the US, told Guardian Australia that she, her husband and two-year-old son were taken to the Novotel in Darling Harbour, where they were given a room and a uniformed police officer was guarding every floor.\nWhile stressing that she did not think her family\u2019s circumstance was \u201cunique or desperate\u201d, the woman, who asked not to be named, was critical of the government for the way the policy had been implemented and said people should be allowed breaks outdoors.\nDuring the long wait before arriving at the hotel yesterday, the woman said, officials appeared to have little idea what the process was supposed to be. The family were not allowed to use baggage trolleys to transport their luggage and she said she watched as airport security, airline staff and Border Force officials argued over whose job it was to assist passengers making their way through the terminal.\nThe passengers were given no food during the lengthy wait on the bus, and the woman\u2019s two-year-old son was able to only eat snacks that the group\u2019s bus driver and a sympathetic police officer provided.\n\u201cI think it all goes to the policy being announced and coming into force without sufficient time and understanding among the people who actually had to enforce it,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThere clearly just wasn\u2019t time to do the necessary coordination. When you\u2019re in these stressful circumstances and ask the people who are supposed to be in charge for information and the response is \u2018I don\u2019t know\u2019, it\u2019s not particularly reassuring.\u201d\nThe woman said the food provided \u2013 which comes at allotted times \u2013 was fine, but that she and her husband were now gearing up to spend two weeks with a two-year-old in a single room with locked windows.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got four Thomas the Tank books that I must have read 30 times on the trip over \u2013 I am ready to throw them in the fire \u2013 and some pens and markers,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been drawing pictures with him and trying to stop him drawing on the hotel walls. I really think, like, my husband and I can survive two weeks inside and obviously so many people have it so much worse, but life with a toddler you can\u2019t take outside is not going to be great. I really don\u2019t see why we couldn\u2019t be allowed breaks to walk around a park for an hour a day at least.\u201d\nMelbourne woman Catherine, who asked for her full name not to be used, has been sent to the Hyatt Regency hotel in Sydney. She said she and other guests had been given a per diem of $90 to spend on meals from the room service menu.\n\u201cThat sounds like a lot but it doesn\u2019t go very far,\u201d she said. \u201cEven if you want a cold, preprepared salad it\u2019s quite pricey.\u201d\nCatherine said her room was dusty when she arrived on Sunday and appeared not to have been cleaned for several weeks, but that hotel staff had gone out of their way to be helpful.\n\u201cI\u2019m still very concerned about air quality because we don\u2019t have windows that open. My room when I opened up was super dusty.\n\u201cThe hotel staff are trying to do their best and they\u2019re being very polite, and any request they\u2019re doing their best to accommodate. It does feel as though it\u2019s a bit of a rush job to make a political statement that looks like the government is doing something.\n\u201cWhen you see what was happening at the airport just days before, we\u2019re being scapegoated for those people who arrived before.\n\u201cMany of us are not from Sydney and had interstate transfers booked. We haven\u2019t been given any guarantee that we\u2019ll be able to get home when we\u2019re allowed out of here.\u201d\nAt a press conference on Sunday, the New South Wales police commissioner, Mick Fuller, appeared to dismiss many concerns about conditions in mandated quarantine accommodation.\n\u201cI know there will be people who are unhappy with the bed, the pillow, the heater, dinner and all those type of things,\u201d Fuller said.\n\u201cThe reality is they are in a hotel room and yes they will be isolated for 14 days. That is for their own protection, the protection of their family members and the protection of the NSW community.\n\u201cWe can only take and listen to their complaints and try to reconcile them.\u201d",

Herat\u2019s governor, Abdul Qayum Rahimi, estimated that close to half of the returnees \u201cmight be virus carriers\u201d, raising fears that the influx will place greater strain on Afghanistan\u2019s fragile health system.\nWhile Afghanistan has so far reported only 123 Covid-19 cases \u2013 including 80 in Herat \u2013 and four deaths, officials believe that the real number of infections could be much higher. In a few weeks, the cash-strapped Afghan healthcare system will be put through a test of resilience. Western NGOs have rushed to evacuate their foreign staff and this week the US stripped Afghanistan of $1bn (\u00a3801m) worth of support, leaving Afghan health workers as the country\u2019s only defence in the the fight against the pandemic.\nJawad*, is bracing for what is to come. The infectious diseases department where he works has been responsible for diagnosing patients before they are transferred to a new 100-bed Covid-19 hospital.\nIn his ward, three doctors, three nurses and one specialist are tending to 200 patients. The lack of equipment such as protective masks, hand sterilisers and medical ventilators is the norm. According to Jawad, the hospital doctors have only one or two masks a day at their disposal.\n\u201cI have to keep my mood well, but I\u2019m worried about my family,\u201d Jawad says, before he returns to the hospital for a 24-hour shift. \u201cWe haven\u2019t tested ourselves for Covid-19 yet. If someone in our department tests positive, the hospital will be paralysed and there will be no one to provide the services.\u201d\nAccording to Ali*, another doctor from Herat, the new Covid-19 hospital is ready to admit roughly 150 patients. But once the number of infections passes 1,000, Ali believes, the situation will get out of control. And the predictions have been grim. According to the Afghan ministry of health, the coronavirus could infect 25 million of the country\u2019s 35.5 million people.\n\u201cAfghanistan is a country that has been affected by gross conflict for the past 40 years. There has been a lot of internal displacement, a lot of people who don\u2019t have access to services and education, water, basic healthcare. The situation in hospitals is very daunting, especially with the increasing arrivals from Iran,\u201d says Nicholas Bishop, the emergency response officer at the International Organization for Migration.\nIn the main Covid-19 hospital in Herat, only ten doctors, one specialist and twenty nurses tend to all patients. Even though the province recently received 400m afghanis (\u00a34.2m) from the central government to fight the pandemic, supplies are scarce.\nA countrywide awareness campaign designed to improve levels of understanding of the signs and symptoms of the virus has been in full swing. In Herat alone, 2,000 volunteers are going door to door to inform people.\nBut this may prove insufficient to tame the spread of the disease.\n\u201cWe are facing problems with compliance, because of the lack of awareness, people\u2019s religious beliefs, and because we went through very difficult times in the past 40 years\u201d, says Rahimi. \u201cUntil Afghans do not see things physically right in front of their eyes they do not get alarmed. We are working with the imams to stop prayer gatherings, but we have not been successful. It needs more discussion and this is what we are focusing on.\u201d\nMeanwhile, for health workers in Herat and other provinces, the prospectof an outbreak looks grim. According to Ali, several medical professionals in Herat have tested positive for coronavirus in recent days.\n\u201cWe are not ready for the crisis,\u201d he says.\n* Some names have been changed",

        "content": "The Duchess of Sussex has provided the voiceover \u2013 including plenty of unverifiable comment \u2013 for this sugary documentary about elephant migration\nLast autumn, before she and her husband made it into their current Californian lockdown, Meghan Markle recorded the narration for this lavish new documentary from the Disneynature production unit, streaming on Disney+, her fee being a donation to the Elephants Without Borders conservation charity working in Botswana. The film shows the annual, dramatic migration of an elephant herd across the Kalahari in search of food and drinking water, moving from Botswana\u2019s Okavango Delta in its dry season, heading for the Zambezi and the Victoria Falls: the last being an awe-inspiring phenomenon which Meghan matches with her own spectacular torrents of schmaltz. She takes to Disney-narration like an anthropomorphic duck to water. \u201cFor elephants, family is everything! In this tight-knit group, someone always has your back!\u201d\nThe film is directed by Mark Linfield, Vanessa Berlowitz and Alastair Fothergill, veterans of the BBC Natural History Unit, and they get some great scenes and striking moments, working in the immersive, intimate nature-doc tradition pioneered by David Attenborough. But they are also giving us something in the somewhat silly Disneyfied tradition of The Lion King and The Jungle Book, with a cutesy narrative sneakily fashioned in the edit, and everything but Elton John belting out Circle of Life on the soundtrack. The heroes are the herd\u2019s ageing 40-year-old matriarch Gaia, her younger sister Shani and one adorable little baby elephant: \u201cMeet Jomo!\u201d coos Meghan.\nAs for the others in the herd, they do not have names, and it takes an effort of will to remember that the main three don\u2019t really have names either, unless you speak elephant. \u201cJomo\u201d \u201cShani\u201d and \u201cGaia\u201d are the exotic human names that the directors have given them. There are some making-of-featurette-style scenes over the closing credits, but we don\u2019t get shots of Mark, Vanessa and Alastair arguing in the production office about appropriate names for two mama elephants and a lovable kid. \u201cElspeth, Mavis and Brian?\u201d \u2014 \u201cNah, not elemental and African enough.\u201d \u201cNala, Sarabi and Simba?\u201d \u2014 \u201cI think it\u2019s been done.\u201d\nAnd so Gaia, Shani, Jomo and the gang set off on their epic quest, and there are some undoubtedly striking overhead shots of the network of water-holes (some treacherously dry) as they lumberingly schlep across the colossal plain. The herd leader\u2019s instinct-memory for where to go is part of an unbroken chain of knowledge stretching back for millennia, and Linfield occasionally shows this with little subliminal speeded-up sequences showing hallucinatory flashes of desert and sky.\nThere are some fascinating scenes and set-pieces: especially a little calf having to be rescued from one pool\u2019s churned-up mud, and the elephants getting water by tearing the bark from the Baobab trees. But again and again, Markle is given outrageously unverifiable things to say, such as: \u201cGaia remembers these birds leading her mother to the water\u2026.\u201d And Shani later supposedly \u201c\u2026looks back on all the lessons she learned from Gaia.\u201d You expect that this film, like an episode of The Office or Parks and Recreation, is suddenly going to include a shot of Gaia telling on off-camera interviewer: \u201cMmm, yeah, I totally remember my mom being led by those birds over to this water\u2026\u201d\nOnce the target has been achieved, a dry season rolls around, and the elephants must turn around and head home. All the while, they are concerned about meanie carnivore-predators, such as the crocodiles who hang out in precisely those shallow waters where elephants like drinking, and of course lions, whose Disney-royal glamour status this film warily concedes. It\u2019s a technically impressive work with some lovely images \u2014 and a bit of a sugary taste.\nElephant is released on Disney+ on 3 April.",

        "content": "Health analysts say the private hospital sector should not receive financial relief until they are called to assist with the coronavirus\nHealth policy analysts and economists have accused the private hospital sector of being disingenuous and sparking public panic by saying without government assistance they will be forced to close due to the cancellation of non-essential elective surgery during the Covid-19 pandemic.\nOn Saturday, a coalition of private hospital operators warned the suspension of most semi-urgent and all non-urgent elective surgeries had strangled their revenue streams and would force them to close within days. On Monday, state and territory health ministers and premiers were holding talks with the sector to come to an agreement about how private staff and resources can be utilised elsewhere.\nAhead of the talks Victorian premier Daniel Andrews said staff in private hospitals \u201chave a unique set of skills\u201d.\n\u201cWe will make the best use of those skills to fight this virus,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cone consolidated system of care\u201d would be required in response to Covid-19.\nThe chief executive of Healthe Care, Australia\u2019s third biggest private hospital operator, previously told Guardian Australia the prime minister, Scott Morrison, had caught the sector by surprise when he announced that non-urgent elective surgery would be banned from midnight that night.\nBut chair of the Australian Healthcare Alliance Jennifer Doggett said: \u201cThe private hospital sector is being completely disingenuous by claiming that the elective surgery shutdown was sudden.\u201d\n\u201cThis measure had been called for repeatedly by medical experts and peak bodies such as the Australian Medical Association for weeks and was clear,\u201d she said. \u201cThe private hospital sector is only one of many industries suffering from a loss of business due to the pandemic \u2013 they should not be entitled to any more support than any other private business.\u201d\nDoggett said it was essential the mixed public and private health system in Australia had a plan in place for diverting resources from elective to urgent services when required. This plan should have been developed prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, she said, \u201cso that it could be implemented promptly and without the political opportunism that is being displayed currently by the private hospital sector\u201d. \n Doggett added that private hospitals benefited from significant amounts of government funding, via Medicare and the private health insurance rebate.\n\u201cAs part of this public funding they should be required to work collaboratively with government in a national health crisis situation,\u201d she said. \u201cThis would at least deliver some returns to Australians for the billions of tax payer dollars invested into the private health sector every year. The Covid-19 pandemic should make it clear that Australians have been misled about the importance of private health insurance by governments and the private health sector.\n\u201cI guess they are used to being treated as a special case and getting bailed out by government.\u201d\nHealth economist Stephen Duckett, the health program director at the Grattan Institute, said private hospitals were not the only sector forced to stand down staff and close doors.\n\u201cMany businesses have collapsed,\u201d he said. \u201cThe question is, should private hospitals be treated any differently from any other industry and get any extra support? I haven\u2019t seen an argument from private hospitals about why, if staff are stood down now, they wouldn\u2019t be available in a few weeks when they are needed, so it\u2019s not like this is permanent. I just haven\u2019t seen an argument aside from them making statements designed to pressure the government and attract public sympathy.\u201d\nHe said the sector should not be provided with any financial relief from government until they were called in to assist with the Covid-19 response.\n\u201cI would hope that by now contractual arrangements are in place so they can swing into action when public hospital system risks being overwhelmed and that\u2019s when they should be paid by government,\u201d Duckett said.\nConsumers Health Forum CEO Leanne Wells said in times of crisis the public and private sectors must work together.\n\u201cTo reduce what we know is going to be mounting pressure on public hospitals and to assure consumers our system\u2019s capacity is being optimised, we urge the government and private hospitals to work together to ensure that private infrastructure and workforce, rather than being shutdown and stood down, is deployed as part of the community-wide campaign to fight the virus,\u201d she said.",

        "content": "Firm wants to reduce \u00a34.5bn in spending, including payments for new aircraft from Airbus\nEasyJet has grounded its entire fleet of aircraft for at least two months and will seek to scale back plans for \u00a34.5bn of spending, including payments for new planes from Airbus, in response to the collapse in demand for air travel because of the coronavirus pandemic.\nThe budget airline said it could not put a firm date on restarting commercial flights and 4,000 of its 9,000 UK staff will be furloughed, initially for two months, from 1 April.\nEasyJet also said it would seek to pay less for new aircraft after its founder, Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, threatened to call repeated shareholder meetings to remove directors until the airline reconsidered buying 107 new aircraft from Airbus. The new Airbus planes are a major part of easyJet\u2019s planned \u00a34.5bn in capital expenditure up to 2023.\nHaji-Ioannou, whose family holds 34% of the company\u2019s shares, described the bill for new aircraft as \u201cthe main risk to survival of the company\u201d. His demands came in a letter sent to the easyJet chairman, John Barton, on Sunday.\nIn response to Haji-Ioannou, easyJet said it was \u201cworking with suppliers to defer and reduce payments where possible, including on aircraft expenditure\u201d.\nThe global airline industry is caught up in an unprecedented crisis, with companies laying off workers by the thousand, on the back of strict travel restrictions across most of the main air travel markets.\nBritish Airways\u2019 owner, International Airlines Group, on Monday said it had extended a $1.38bn (\u00a31.09bn) credit buffer by a year to June 2021. The latest agreement with its lenders meant it had access to \u20ac9.3bn (\u00a38.13bn) in cash, cash equivalents and loans, which it could use to ride out the crisis.\nHowever, the almost total loss of revenues threatens the survival of many airlines. Loganair, the Scottish regional carrier, said on Monday it would be seeking government assistance beyond that offered to all British companies, despite the government\u2019s insistence that it would not offer an industry-wide bailout.\nLoganair\u2019s chief executive, Jonathan Hinkles, told BBC radio: \u201cI do think, that like the vast majority of UK airlines, we will be going back to take up that invite for further conversation with the Treasury in the coming days because we have to.\u201d\nQatar Airways said on Sunday it would eventually need state aid, despite being one of the few global airlines continuing to run commercial scheduled flights, mainly to allow people to return home.\nHowever, on Monday easyJet insisted it would not seek \u201cbespoke\u201d state aid after its chief executive, Johan Lundgren, said the airline might seek government loans on commercial terms, although the company did say it might use the government\u2019s Covid-19 corporate finance facility.\nHaji-Ioannou added in his letter that he did not support easyJet applying for government loans. He wrote that he would be willing to participate in an equity issue if the airline needed more cash \u2013 as long as the Airbus order were cancelled \u2013 but added that he would not return the dividend the airline paid shareholders this month.\n\u201cThe point is that now easyJet needs more equity and all shareholders can decide if they want to invest again in the company to support it in return for new shares,\u201d Haji-Ioannou said, in a second statement on Monday afternoon. \u201cNot because of some random act of \u2018charitable gift\u2019.\u201d\nEasyJet had focused on repatriating customers in recent days after travel restrictions came into force across most of its main markets. However, the last of 650 repatriation flights ended on Sunday.\nGrounding the fleet removes \u201csignificant cost\u201d, easyJet said. The move also means that furloughed staff in the UK will be paid 80% of their salaries through the government\u2019s job retention scheme. There were separate arrangements with governments in other countries where easyJet staff are based, a spokeswoman said.\nMany of the staff furloughed by easyJet, as well as Virgin Atlantic, will be drafted in to help in temporary \u201cNightingale\u201d hospitals built to cope with a wave of thousands of expected coronavirus patients.\nEasyJet has invited staff to volunteer for further training before helping out at the critical-care field hospitals in London, Birmingham and Manchester, while Virgin will contact 4,000 of its staff who may have the relevant skills needed to provide help.\nThe UK government has warned that it will not give a sector-wide bailout for airlines struggling with the coronavirus lockdown. However, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, indicated that the government would consider support on a case-by-case basis.\nVirgin Atlantic, the airline founded by the billionaire Sir Richard Branson has asked the government for hundreds of millions of pounds of state aid. The long-haul passenger airline does not have the cash reserves to ride out months of grounded flights and almost all staff are on unpaid leave.\nBritish Airways\u2019 owner, International Airlines Group, has so far said it would not ask for state aid. IAG, which also runs Spain\u2019s Iberia and Vueling, and the Irish flag carrier Aer Lingus, filed an official complaint over the rescue deal offered to Flybe before it went bust.\nLoganair, the Glasgow-based airline with 650 employees, said its position providing government-protected services to remote Highlands and Scottish island destinations meant it could not shut down and it needed aid.\nRyanair joined IAG in criticising the Flybe state aid and said it had \u20ac4bn in cash to tide it over. The EU\u2019s largest low-cost carrier has grounded all its flights and cut all salaries by 50%.\nJet2\u2019s owner, Dart Group, has suspended all flights until 1 May at least and said it was in talks with lenders. It declined to comment on Monday on whether it would seek state aid, having this month said it would consider doing so.\nFlybe, previously the EU\u2019s largest regional carrier, collapsed as the coronavirus crisis started to hit flight demand. The bankruptcy cost 2,000 jobs and has rippled through the supply chain, with job cuts from companies such as Swissport at regional airports.",

        "content": "Absence of plane contrails offers chance to test theory of rise in diurnal temperatures\nThere was heated scientific debate after the 9/11 attacks on New York, when all airline flights were grounded for three days, about the effect the absence of aircraft contrails had on temperatures. The main conclusion was that daytime temperatures rose and the nights were cooler, the argument was by how much. Some put the afternoon temperatures as much as 1.5C higher and the nights similarly cooler, others said it was a fraction of a degree.\nAs it happened, the weather was exceptionally clear at the time so the contrails crossing the crowded skies over the US would normally have been highly visible. Since then there have been attempts to replicate the unlooked-for experiment by measuring temperatures in different parts of the US with similar landscapes and weather conditions, the only difference being the volume of flights passing above. These seemed to confirm that the diurnal temperatures, the difference between daytime highs and nighttime lows, increased significantly with the absence of aircraft.\nNow with the coronavirus pandemic causing most flights to be cancelled it is a chance to test this theory over several different landmasses at once. This matters because in a heat wave it could be dangerous for some people if temperatures rose significantly, or for farmers if it produced late spring frosts.",

        "content": "When No\u00e9 \u00c1lvarez joined an extraordinary ultramarathon he tested himself physically and mentally, while also connecting with his heritage\nWhile jogging on the spot, Mexican-American runner No\u00e9 \u00c1lvarez showed his passport to the border agent in Nogales, Arizona. \u00c1lvarez was participating in the Peace and Dignity Journeys (PDJ), an ultramarathon for runners of indigenous background like himself. His group had run 3,200 miles from the Arctic to the US border with Mexico. They still had miles to go before their destination of the Panama Canal, but for \u00c1lvarez, the crossing into Mexico had extra meaning \u2013 it was the homeland of his parents before they immigrated to the US. The border agent, a fellow Latino, smirkingly asked if he was running in the wrong direction.\nIt\u2019s an emotional moment in \u00c1lvarez\u2019s new memoir, Spirit Run: A 6,000-Mile Marathon Through North America\u2019s Stolen Land. The book chronicles not only that epic run in 2004 but also the background of the author and his immigrant parents.\n\u201cI feel like I\u2019m still writing it,\u201d \u00c1lvarez says. \u201cIt continues to inform my life. It took me years to figure out how I was going to tell it.\u201d Ultimately, he decided on uniting the beauty of the journey and the messy moments along the way \u201cthrough the medium of running.\u201d\nAnd what a run it was. The PDJ is a quadrennial event intended to reconnect indigenous participants with their ancestral land, with the latest edition, which had been due to take place this year, postponed due to the Covid-19 outbreak. In 2004, \u00c1lvarez\u2019s group was heading south to rendezvous with another group running north from Argentina.\n\u201cWe ran beyond trying to burn calories,\u201d \u00c1lvarez says. \u201cThose [kind of] runners didn\u2019t last. It\u2019s bigger, larger than yourself \u2026 Before you knew it, 10, 15, 20 [miles a day] was easy,\u201d although, he clarifies, \u201cwe were hurting afterward.\u201d\nThere were unexpected difficulties -- an encounter between \u00c1lvarez and a mountain lion in Oregon, stone-throwing motorists in Mexico, and tensions between the author and some of his fellow runners. And he didn\u2019t quite finish the way he intended to. But the first-time author has come to find satisfaction in both the run and his life trajectory.\n\u00c1lvarez grew up in Yakima, Washington, the son of Mexican immigrants of Pur\u00e9pecha heritage. His father worked in an orchard, his mother at an apple-packing plant. As a teenager, he worked with his mother at the plant, describing the days as physically demanding; he said his mother is starting to lose sensation in her hands from overwork. He also started to run, although he grew up thinking of it as a way to keep one step ahead of immigration authorities.\nHe received a full scholarship to Whitman College in Walla Walla, Washington, but says he felt \u201ccultural shock on all sorts of levels. I had difficulties, there was the shame of failing, I could not save my family.\u201d Serendipitously, he learned of the PDJ from \u201ca friend of a friend of a friend.\u201d\n\u201cI had to do this,\u201d \u00c1lvarez explains. \u201cIt was part of my escape. I was not connected to college at the time. It was not how I needed to learn. College was joining the run.\u201d\nHe joined one month in, after the group had started its journey from Alaska. Their paths crossed in British Columbia. Fellow runners collectively represented nine indigenous communities.\n\u201cIt was interesting to see how fluid and multilayered our identities were,\u201d he says of his fellow participants, whom he portrays through composite characters in the book. They included runners of Mexican heritage living in Canada, and \u201can elder, our spiritual guide, from the Arctic.\u201d He noted that there were \u201csome former gang and military members and others completely living off the land,\u201d and women runners committed to \u201cfemale energy, healing power, balance.\u201d\nPDJ runners start and end each day with a ceremony, and carry feathered staffs during the run. Daily destinations are indigenous communities across North America. At each stop, community members share an important cultural story with the runners, signifying the story with a feather to add to the staff. Sometimes they also shared running traditions, including running as a group in the Tohono O\u2019odham territory in the Arizona desert.\n\u00c1lvarez, who had never run more than 10 miles in a day, would receive myriad tests. The PDJ takes place relay-style, with each runner committing to a certain amount of mileage each day while others wait their turn while traveling by motor vehicle. He learned to eat on the run, finding that a hard-boiled egg stuffed into his pocket might not be the wisest nourishment with wildlife around. He and his fellow runners slept in all manner of venues, from campgrounds to casinos, and encountered varying terrain, from the forests of Canada to the deserts of Washington and Arizona to the jungles of Mexico.\n\u201cIt was not just running blindly,\u201d \u00c1lvarez says. \u201cIt\u2019s a story about why land is important to people.\u201d He noted that in the Canadian forests, trees were being cut down for the ski industry and the Winter Olympics, while more arid areas were suffering from drought.\n\u201cWe honored the land that a lot of people depend on,\u201d \u00c1lvarez says. \u201cWe were physically walking, running and connecting with it every step of the way.\u201d\nIn Oregon, he made an unexpected connection \u2013 a mountain lion waiting for him atop a peak.\n\u201cI was completely unprepared,\u201d \u00c1lvarez recalls. \u201cI couldn\u2019t run back. I had to keep moving forward.\u201d He says that when he joined the run, \u201cone guy, a really good friend and spiritual guide, talked about how to be thankful for the presence of an animal that decides to notice you, sort of take it as a message, an opportunity to reflect.\u201d\nIn the book, \u00c1lvarez describes the mix of gratitude and footwork that helped him escape the big cat. \u201cLuckily, I\u2019m still here,\u201d he says. \u201cI did some studies on what you\u2019re supposed to do, and they said definitely don\u2019t run. It\u2019s definitely the dumbest thing I probably ever did.\u201d\nAfter the group crossed into Mexico, they encountered a different kind of danger: people who threw rocks from cars. Female runners were also at risk of assault; \u00c1lvarez describes one attempt that left some runners wary of continuing.\n\u201cWe came across situations with real shady encounters, people trying to force you into a vehicle, throw rocks at you, who didn\u2019t want you there,\u201d \u00c1lvarez says. \u201cWe adjusted, ran in pairs \u2026 Some territories were extremely unsafe. If you didn\u2019t want to run, you didn\u2019t have to. Others took on the miles.\u201d\nUltimately, it was a familiar runner\u2019s story \u2013 injury \u2013 that determined \u00c1lvarez would finished his run in Guatemala before he could reach the Panama Canal. He calls it \u201cthe toughest decision, probably, I ever had to make.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to quit,\u201d he says. \u201cBut knowing when to quit was part of the lesson.\u201d\nThis lesson has stayed with him ever since \u2013 as has the border officer\u2019s question about whether he was running in the wrong direction.\n\u201cI no longer think about the wrong direction,\u201d \u00c1lvarez says. \u201cI have a line of inquiry now, a ritual of asking the questions I need to.\u201d And, he says, \u201cRunning is the way I process things now.\u201d",

        "content": "In a time of crisis, the idiosyncratic director offers a different idea of \u2018national character\u2019 in new film The Whalebone Box\nWith cinemas shuttered and blockbusters blocked, this is an opportunity to explore film-makers you might usually overlook. This week, I nominate Andrew K\u00f6tting. You wouldn\u2019t confuse his experimental, low-budget, idiosyncratic films with a Marvel movie but, in his own way, K\u00f6tting is a national treasure.\nIn times of crisis, Britons tend to invoke a familiar, very limited idea of \u201cnational character\u201d, invariably informed by the second world war, empire and royalty. But in his wanderings across the landscape, K\u00f6tting finds a very different vision of Britishness: eccentric, romantic, anarchic, inclusive, mysterious, yet down-to-earth and unpretentious.\nHis latest, The Whalebone Box (released on Mubi on Friday) is vintage K\u00f6tting. He needs little excuse to set off on a cross-country odyssey. In this case it is a strange casket, which he undertakes to return to the Outer Hebrides, where the whale from which the box was made was originally found. As with much of K\u00f6tting\u2019s work, the film is a ramshackle collage of documentary footage, archive clips, music, sounds, interviews and digressions into folklore, history, art and dreams \u2013 often related to whales and boxes. Along for the trip are some regular collaborators: author and psychogeographer Iain Sinclair; pinhole photographer Anonymous Bosch; Scots poet-singer MacGillivray (who provides otherworldly mermaid chanting); and K\u00f6tting\u2019s daughter Eden, who has a rare genetic disorder called Joubert\u2019s Syndrome.\nWe first saw Eden as a seven-year-old in K\u00f6tting\u2019s 1996 feature debut Gallivant, in which the two travelled round the British coastline along with K\u00f6tting\u2019s 85-year-old grandmother. At the time, K\u00f6tting was unsure how long either had to live. Today, Eden is an artist, and K\u00f6tting has undertaken many more intrepid excursions: in Swandown, a river journey from Hastings to the 2012 London Olympics site in a swan-shaped pedalo; in 2015\u2019s By Our Selves, a walk to Northampton in the footsteps of 19th-century poet John Clare (with K\u00f6tting dressed as a straw bear). Each time he traverses the landscape, he uncovers new layers of history, mythology and strangeness, and adds another one himself.\nUnclassifiable as he is, K\u00f6tting fits into a network of artists operating in this territory, many of whom he has collaborated with, including the comics magus Alan Moore and the comedian Stewart Lee. You can see a similar spirit running through the films of, say, Derek Jarman, Grant Gee and Ben Wheatley, or extend the tradition back through Peter Ackroyd, JG Ballard and William Blake. They are keepers of the flame for an idea of British culture that has largely been consigned to the margins \u2013 which is possibly where it\u2019s happiest.",

        "content": "A summary of the major developments in the coronavirus outbreak across Australia\nGood evening, and welcome to our daily roundup of the latest developments on the coronavirus pandemic in Australia. These are the main stories on Monday 30 March.\nBusinesses will be given wage subsidies of $1,500 a fortnight for each worker to keep staff on during the coronavirus crisis as part of an unprecedented $130bn package. Prime minister Scott Morrison said the package could help 6 million Australians. The federal government will give the allowance to businesses and not-for-profit organisations that have taken a 30% hit to turnover because of the coronavirus. Companies turning over more than $1bn will be eligible if they have taken a 50% hit. The subsidies will last for six months, with full-time, part-time and casual workers who have been with their employer for at least 12 months eligible. Sole traders have also been included in the package. Payments will flow to businesses in the first week of May, with the program to start from 30 March. Workers stood down since 1 March will be able to qualify for backdated payments.\nFollowing the national cabinet\u2019s advice on Sunday that social gatherings be limited to two people \u2013 unless the people live in the same household \u2013 most states have today announced they will be enforcing the rule. Western Australia and Tasmania have said they will enforce the new limits, while Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory have gone further.\nThose states are also moving to enforce the new advice stipulating people should only leave the house for essential reasons \u2013 such as shopping for essentials, to receive medical care or to attend work, childcare or education that cannot be done from home. More detail on these rules and enforcement can be found here. So far only the Northern Territory announced it would not be enforcing the new two-person rule, with chief minister, Michael Gunner, saying they would stick to the 10-person limit for now.\nAustralians who have flown back to the country since midnight Saturday have been placed into an enforced 14-day quarantine in city hotels where some say they are not permitted to leave rooms or open windows, and are being given inadequate food. Paula Lemmon, who has multiple serious food allergies, has only been able to eat two small containers of chopped tomato and cucumber in almost 24 hours since arriving back in Australia and being placed in hotel quarantine in Sydney. \u201cWe completely understand travellers are a high risk \u2013 we are 100% for quarantining,\u201d Paula\u2019s daughter, Olivia, told Guardian Australia. \u201cWe\u2019d be happy to be in a caravan \u2026 But we\u2019re not staying at a five-star hotel, we\u2019re staying at a government-run quarantine centre and we\u2019re not getting basic needs.\u201d\nThe ACT and Tasmania recorded their first deaths from coronavirus. ACT chief health officer, Dr Kerryn Coleman, said a woman in her 80s died after catching the illness overseas. \u201cThis is the very sad reality of this disease, which is seeing the elderly at an increased risk of complications from Covid-19,\u201d she said. In Tasmania, a woman, also aged in her 80s, died on Monday morning at the North West Regional hospital in Burnie.\nThe Northern Territory is beefing-up its border controls, ordering all arrivals from interstate or overseas into 14-days of forced and supervised quarantine in response to the coronavirus pandemic. From midnight on Wednesday, all arrivals will have to comply with the new rules, while from midnight on Friday anyone who arrives will be forced to pay for their hotel stay during the quarantine period. Chief minister Michael Gunner said people wanting to come to the territory had been given enough notice that such travel was not advised. \u201cDo not come here, we do not want you here. Sorry, but not right now,\u201d he said. He said his aim with the new measures was to not just slow the flow of people across the border, but to stop it completely. So far the territory has recorded 15 confirmed Covid-19 cases, all linked to overseas travel.\nThe deputy chief medical officer committed to releasing the modelling the medical panel is using to guide its decisions, including the restrictions. Paul Kelly said transparency was \u201cvery important\u201d and that \u201cas of today, I have asked my staff to organise a meeting later this week where the modelling and the epidemiology and the public health response will be unlocked, and people will be able to ask questions about that\u201d.\nAn Australian astrophysicist has been admitted to hospital after getting four magnets stuck up his nose in an attempt to invent a device that stops people touching their faces during the coronavirus outbreak. Dr Daniel Reardon, a research fellow at Melbourne\u2019s Swinburne University, was building a necklace that sounds an alarm on facial contact, when the mishap occurred on Thursday night. Before attending the hospital, Reardon attempted to use pliers to pull them out, but they became magnetised by the magnets inside his nose.\nCoronavirus key questions: everything you need to know\nCoronavirus Australia maps and cases: live numbers and statistics\nAustralia coronavirus shutdown: what is open, closed and banned under the current rules?\nCoronavirus two-person rule: what we know about this and Australia\u2019s other social distancing measures\nCoronavirus vaccine: when will it be ready?\nDangerous cures and viral hoaxes: common coronavirus myths busted\nHow long does coronavirus live on different surfaces?\nWho is most at risk of contracting coronavirus?\nHow ventilators work and why they are so important in saving people with coronavirus\nHave I already had coronavirus?

Some might be looking for an abatement, and they pay it at the end. Maybe the rent could be paid over two years as a small rent increase.\u201d\nState governments will need to legislate to ban evictions, but in the meantime the government has acted through the banks to give landlords an incentive not to kick out delinquent tenants.\nBoth ANZ and Westpac on Monday extended the availability of concessional loans under a federal government-backed program to businesses that have borrowed as much as $10m \u2013 but on the condition they not evict tenants whose operations have been hurt by the coronavirus pandemic.",

There, I\u2019ve said it. It wasn\u2019t easy. When your job is writing about films, not having watched Stanley Kubrick\u2019s space epic is like being a taxi driver who hasn\u2019t passed the driving test. It\u2019s a basic qualification. Because 2001 is officially a masterpiece: number six on Sight & Sound\u2019s list of greatest movies; the best sci-fi ever made according to Time Out and the Guardian. It\u2019s one of those films that movie lovers all seem to have watched at an impressionable age. Christopher Nolan has spoken about going with his dad when he was seven to see a rerelease in Leicester Square.\n  I\u2019m not sure how I didn\u2019t see it growing up. My dad is a film buff who adores Kubrick and never bothered too much about age certificates and ratings. We first watched The Shining together when I was 10 or 11. In my early teens, I was obsessed with Full Metal Jacket. Then came A Clockwork Orange and Dr Strangelove. I never got on with Lolita but I\u2019m in heaven with Barry Lyndon. I\u2019m a big Kubrick fan, I\u2019ve even read the biography his chauffeur wrote.\nYou can probably hear the whiny high-pitched \u201ctake me seriously please\u201d desperation here. But to be honest, I think the real reason that I never saw 2001 is that I\u2019m just not very science-y. The thought of infinite space does not fill me with a sense of awe. I did keep meaning to see it, but then well, I never did. And the funny thing is, I understood the pop culture parodies without having watched it.\nI wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019ve ever lied about it. But I\u2019ve definitely nodded along as someone banged on about the psychotic computer HAL 9000 or tripping off their nut while watching 2001. My partner doesn\u2019t know I haven\u2019t seen it. If I\u2019d told him on the night we met and talked non-stop for two hours about films, would he still have asked for my number?\nAnyway, thank you Guardian for making me watch 2001: A Space Odyssey. Going to the cinema was not an option so I rented it on Google Play and watched on an ancient projector. And, what can I say? It\u2019s a bloody masterpiece. I watched the opening Dawn of Man sequence in wonder at this perfect image of the spark of human consciousness. What fun Kubrick would have had, I thought, with Andy Serkis\u2019s motion capture technology. Yet his society of human ancestors (played by mimes in furry suits) is perfect. The colour, the extravagance of all those beautiful space sets, what a vision of a future. I still have the imagination of a potato when it comes to space but I loved this movie.\nWhat I will say is that 2001 does not work as escapism. I usually like a film with big long expanses of silence to get lost in. I\u2019m quite partial to a bit of uncompromising slowness. But right now, my brain is 50 miles a minute. Concentrating on anything for more than 43 seconds is impossible. The film\u2019s sense of emptiness made me edgy. But I\u2019ll be back, when cinemas reopen.\nFunnily enough, I watched 2001 with headphones on while my toddler napped with a fever in bed next to me. She woke up right at the end, at the bit where the freaky big baby in a bubble hovers next to the moon. She was transfixed \u2013 the moon and babies are two of her favourite things. So, who knows, maybe for her it will be a film she remembers watching at an impressionable age.",

Instead, standing barefoot in the grass, he found himself face to face with a wolf. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget that face as long as I live. I just close my eyes and see it.\u201d\u2019 The story of a wolf who became legendary for his resilience and tenderness, and his recent tragic death.\nJohn Robbie made his name playing rugby for Ireland, the Lions and in South Africa. He toured during apartheid, a decision he considers a stain that will never leave him. In this fascinating interview he tells of how he stayed in the country to play rugby, \u201cliving in this privileged bubble\u201d, but began to speak out. Eventually he came to have a popular breakfast radio show in Johannesburg, where he gained a reputation for holding politicians to account and championing the new South Africa. \u201cI have always hoped that my work will go in some small way to atoning for that decision I made coming out here as a player.\u201d\nWeekend magazine\u2019s Experience column has delighted, gripped and engaged readers for many years. Here, Lauren Smith tells of how her son saved both their lives after she had a seizure driving down a dual carriageway. \u201cI gripped the steering wheel tightly, then let go. That\u2019s when we began swerving to the right. Other cars were beeping. We crashed into the central reservation and scraped along it as the car continued to pick up speed.\u201d\nInterviewing Julian Casablancas a few years ago, Alexis Petridis notes, could be \u201cthe kind of event that journalists discussed among themselves in hushed, horrified tones\u201d. Happily things go rather better here, with the band discussing their failure to match their initial success, being more famous outside of America, internal conflict and their new album, \u201cthe best thing they have done in years\u201d.\nWhen you\u2019re unable to travel, a bit of lateral thinking and a streaming service can be a godsend.

Craig Brown captures Paul\u2019s efforts to live in disguise in France (\u201cIt made me remember why we all wanted to be famous\u201d), the night George and John had their drinks spiked by their dentist and a Christmas dinner at Apple featuring the largest turkey in the UK, Hells Angels, 40 children, John and Yoko dressed as Father and Mother Christmas \u2026 and a punch-up.\nPatience Agbabi\u2019s son Solomon was diagnosed with autism when he was five years old.

Local villagers, members of the Ng\u00e4be-Bugl\u00e9 indigenous group, are adamant that \u2013 were it not for a long history of state abandonment \u2013 lives could have been saved.\u201d\nPaul Rees remembers Barry John, \u201ca mixture of Machiavelli and Napoleon\u201d, and how he turned certain defeat into an unlikely victory. \u201cIt became clear, as three defenders converged on him, that he was not going to make it but still he went on. At the point just before the three pounced on him, he passed blindly out of the back of his right hand. Chugging up in support, the No 8 did not have to break his stride, only catch the ball with the defence occupied elsewhere.\u201d\n\u201cBarely three weeks since Hachette cancelled Woody Allen\u2019s memoir, the book has been published elsewhere, and confirms that Stephen King, among many others, was right to worry about its suppression. The only person who stood to benefit from the silencing of Woody Allen was Woody Allen.\u201d\nA host of celebrity children, from John Lennon\u2019s son to Samuel L Jackson\u2019s daughter, recall growing up in the shadow of a parent. These stories take an alien experience that can be difficult to empathise with and render it human and relatable while at the same time casting fresh light on people we think we know well. \u201cBy the time The Big Lebowski came out, I was in high school, and, just like a typical teenager, I had zero interest in my father\u2019s work. What I remember most is that my dad was wearing those hideous Sun Jellies from the movie. They were actually my dad\u2019s own shoes. My sister and I were so embarrassed, we threw them into the ocean. Today, they\u2019d probably be worth a lot of money.\u201d\nLike all the best non-fiction reviews, this piece from Andrew Rawnsley captures the essence of a book with concision and builds an argument beyond it. Here he notes that the memoir of Theresa May\u2019s former svengali, Nick Timothy, \u201creads like an account from a very distant time. This was the era before the 2019 election when Johnson won the Tory majority that May couldn\u2019t. Before we\u2019d left the EU. Before the coronavirus crisis, the scale of which makes all other politics look exceedingly small and gives a petty flavour to tales of past personality clashes.\u201d\nEmma Beddington\u2019s thoughts on a universal fear for parents struck a real chord with our readers. \u201cIt\u2019s a slow then all-at-once thing, this parenting business. The days felt interminable for years (there was a single afternoon in 2004 when they both had chickenpox that definitely took five years off my life; and time seemed to take on a hallucinatory, elastic quality as my elder son examined every knob and twiddly bit of every train in the London Transport Museum every week for a year), now suddenly there\u2019s no time left.\u201d\nBright and irresistible, K-pop provides the beat to South Korea\u2019s youth culture. But behind the perfect smiles and dance routines are tales of sexism and abuse, says Crystal Tai, in this fascinating look behind the scenes of the country\u2019s best-known cultural export. \u201cAt the height of their fame, these men and women seem to have buckled under the strain, unable to live up to the demands placed on them to be polished, picture-perfect ambassadors of this effervescent pop music.\u201d",

But a look at household finances reveals that cash injection might not last long for those affected by the pandemic.\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) publishes detailed information about household spending; everything from pets ($55 a month on average), to fresh fruits ($27) and healthcare ($414). The data shows that the Covid-19 aid package would support the average person earning less than $75,000 for less than two weeks.

Under the terms of the bill, these couples would receive a cash payment of $2,400 and couples earning $150,000-$198,000 would receive a lower payment based on a sliding scale.\nThe result is still bleak.

        "content": "Internal documents describe how to profit from farmer losses and desire to oppose some independent testing \nThe US agriculture giant Monsanto and the German chemical giant BASF were aware for years that their plan to introduce a new agricultural seed and chemical system would probably lead to damage on many US farms, internal documents seen by the Guardian show.\nRisks were downplayed even while they planned how to profit off farmers who would buy Monsanto\u2019s new seeds just to avoid damage, according to documents unearthed during a recent successful $265m lawsuit brought against both firms by a Missouri farmer.\nThe documents, some of which date back more than a decade, also reveal how Monsanto opposed some third-party product testing in order to curtail the generation of data that might have worried regulators.\nAnd in some of the internal emails, employees appear to joke about sharing \u201cvoodoo science\u201d and hoping to stay \u201cout of jail\u201d.\nThe new crop system developed by Monsanto and BASF was designed to address the fact that millions of acres of US farmland have become overrun with weeds resistant to Monsanto\u2019s glyphosate-based weedkillers, best known as Roundup. The collaboration between the two companies was built around a different herbicide called dicamba.\nIn the Roundup system, farmers could spray glyphosate herbicides such as Roundup over the top of certain crops that Monsanto genetically engineered to survive being sprayed with the pesticide. This \u201cglyphosate-tolerant\u201d crop system has been popular with farmers around the world but has led to widespread weed resistance to glyphosate. The new system promoted by Monsanto and BASF similarly provides farmers with genetically engineered dicamba-tolerant soybeans and cotton that can be sprayed directly with dicamba. The weeds in the fields die but the crops do not.\nDicamba has been in use since the 1960s but traditionally was used sparingly, and not on growing crops, because it has a track record of volatilizing \u2013 moving far from where it is sprayed \u2013 particularly in warm growing months. As it moves it can damage or kill the plants it drifts across.\nThe companies announced in 2011 that they were collaborating in the development of the dicamba-tolerant cropping systems, granting each other reciprocal licenses, with BASF agreeing to supply formulated dicamba herbicide products to Monsanto.\nThe companies said they would make new dicamba formulations that would stay where they were sprayed and would not volatilize as older versions of dicamba were believed to do. With good training, special nozzles, buffer zones and other \u201cstewardship\u201d practices, the companies assured regulators and farmers that the new system would bring \u201creally good farmer-friendly formulations to the marketplace\u201d.\nBut in private meetings dating back to 2009, records show agricultural experts warned that the plan to develop a dicamba-tolerant system could have catastrophic consequences. The experts told Monsanto that farmers were likely to spray old volatile versions of dicamba on the new dicamba-tolerant crops and even new versions were still likely to be volatile enough to move away from the special cotton and soybean fields on to crops growing on other farms.\nImportantly, under the system designed by Monsanto and BASF, only farmers buying Monsanto\u2019s dicamba-tolerant cotton and soybean seeds would be protected from dicamba drift damage. Other cotton and soybean farmers and farmers growing everything from wheat to watermelons would be at risk from the drifting dicamba.\nAccording to a report prepared for Monsanto in 2009 as part of industry consultation, such \u201coff-target movement\u201d was expected, along with \u201ccrop loss\u201d, \u201clawsuits\u201d and \u201cnegative press around pesticides\u201d.\nA 2015 document shows that Monsanto\u2019s own projections estimated that dicamba damage claims from farmers would total more than 10,000 cases, including 1,305 in 2016, 2,765 in 2017 and 3,259 in 2018.\nBoth Monsanto and BASF defended their products and their different roles in bringing the new dicamba crop system to market. BASF said dicamba is safe \u201cwhen used correctly\u201d and an important tool for farmers. Monsanto said its XtendiMax dicamba herbicide, which it said was not invented until 2012, was \u201ccomprehensively evaluated\u201d by the Environmental Protection agency (EPA) \u201cand determined it does not pose any unreasonable risks of off-target movement when used according to label directions\u201d.\nSeveral million acres of crops have now been reported damaged by dicamba, according to industry estimates. And more than 100 US farmers are engaged in litigation in federal court alleging Monsanto and BASF collaboration created a \u201cdefective\u201d crop system that has damaged orchards, gardens and organic and non-organic farm fields in multiple states.\nLast month the first trial over dicamba damage ended with a $265m jury verdict against Monsanto and BASF. The documents reviewed by the Guardian were obtained through court-ordered discovery by the law firm that won that case.\nThe jury found on behalf of Missouri peach farmers Bill and Denise Bader, who alleged the companies\u2019 actions led to the dicamba drift that damaged 30,000 peach trees, ruining their 34-year-old family farm. The companies\u2019 actions to encourage widespread spraying of dicamba over large areas created an \u201cecological disaster\u201d, Bader attorney Bill Randles told the jury.\nBASF and Monsanto\u2019s German owner, Bayer AG, has denied liability and has said it plans to appeal against the verdict in the peach farmer case. Their products are safe and effective when used correctly, both say. Monsanto\u2019s owner, Bayer is also dealing with thousands of lawsuits alleging its glyphosate weedkillers cause cancer. Three juries so far have found that Roundup is carcinogenic and that Monsanto hid the risks.\nJust as Monsanto has done in the Roundup litigation, Monsanto and BASF sought to keep most of the discovery documents they turned over in the dicamba litigation designated confidential. Roughly 180 have been unsealed and were cited at the Bader trial.\n\u201cThe documents are the worst that I\u2019ve ever seen for any case that I\u2019ve worked on,\u201d said lawyer Angie Splittgerber, a former tobacco industry defense attorney who works with Randles in the firm Randles & Splittgerber. \u201cSo many of them put things in writing that were just horrifying.\u201d\nThough they worked together to gain regulatory approval for the dicamba seeds, Monsanto and BASF each developed their own distinct dicamba herbicide products to be used with those seeds. And though the seeds were released for planting in 2016, the companies were unable to garner regulatory approval to start selling their new herbicides before 2017.\nAcademics were skeptical of the companies\u2019 new use plan for dicamba from the outset but became more worried when the dicamba-tolerant seeds were commercialized before the new dicamba formulations. As critics had predicted, farmers who bought the new seeds then started spraying their fields with old dicamba formulations despite stickers on the seed bags prohibiting them from doing so.\nThe documents show that both companies were excited about the profit potential in the new system. BASF projected its new dicamba herbicide would be a \u201c$400m brand in two years\u201d, with sales by May 2017 exceeding $131m and a gross profit of 45%.\nThe companies saw part of the opportunity in selling to soybean and cotton farmers who didn\u2019t need or want the special dicamba-tolerant crops but could be convinced to buy them as a means to protect their crops from dicamba drift, the documents show.\nThat strategy was noted in multiple documents. In one BASF 2016 strategy update, the company noted \u201cdefensive planting\u201d as a \u201cpotential market opportunity\u201d. Monsanto also saw \u201cnew users\u201d in farmers who suffered drift damage.\nIn one November 2016 email exchange, a Monsanto distributor noted that \u201call the dicamba drift damage complaints\u201d were spiking demand for Monsanto\u2019s dicamba-tolerant seed. The Monsanto executive responded: \u201cWe have more potential this year than I have ever seen since 09 to blow it out.\u201d\nIn its statement to the Guardian, Monsanto denied that it had planned to target drifters to become new users. The Guardian asked Monsanto to comment on warnings in 2009 that its plan to develop a dicamba crop system could damage farms. Monsanto said this was false and that it stood behind its system. The company said it takes \u201cstewardship responsibility very seriously when introducing any new technology\u201d.\nA series of emails show efforts by Monsanto to block some independent testing by academics of the company\u2019s new dicamba herbicides, in part for fear outside tests would disrupt the company\u2019s efforts to gain product approval from the EPA.\nThe agency was aware of the volatility concerns and Monsanto was seeking to convince the EPA that the concerns were unfounded.\nTwo months later, in April 2015, Monsanto\u2019s Robert Montgomery, who worked in technology development in Tennessee, wrote to colleagues that a University of Arkansas weed scientist had asked if Monsanto would provide \u201ca few milliliters\u201d of its Xtend-formulated dicamba herbicide for testing by academics. Montgomery said the weed scientist was told Monsanto was \u201cnot testing formulation this year because of the difficulty in producing quantities that would allow for broader testing\u201d.\nJoseph Sandbrink, a Monsanto technology development manager, responded: \u201cHahaha. Difficulty in producing enough product for field testing. Hahaha bullshit.\u201d\nIn its statement, Monsanto said it had \u201cfacilitated a number of third-party tests\u201d before and after EPA approvals.\nMonsanto added that emails where individuals were occasionally using \u201cshorthand or colloquialisms\u201d had been \u201ccherry-picked\u201d by lawyers at the recent trial and this does \u201cnot detract from the fact that the products we are talking about were thoroughly tested and approved (twice) by the EPA\u201d.\nAs some predicted, complaints about dicamba drift damage surged after Monsanto introduced its new seeds in 2016, and even after Monsanto and BASF\u2019s new herbicide formulations were introduced in 2017, complaints of off-target movement of dicamba continued.\nBy late 2017, a Monsanto email thread referred to the \u201cwall-to-wall damage we\u2019ve been seeing\u201d.\nThe high level of damage led the EPA to place new restrictions on the use of the dicamba herbicides in 2018, though the agency extended the registration until 20 December 2020. Monsanto, BASF and Corteva, which also markets a dicamba product, are hoping the registrations will be renewed.\nBecause of farmer concerns that dicamba drift would contaminate fruits and vegetable plots, the internal documents show that Monsanto and BASF devised a plan to ask the EPA to allow certain amounts of dicamba residues to be considered legal in crops such as tomatoes, potatoes, grapes and other foods expected to be accidentally exposed to dicamba spray.\nThe EPA said since Monsanto\u2019s new seeds were introduced the agency has received about 1,851 \u201cmajor\u201d and 2,221 \u201caggregate\u201d damage reports, but cautioned that might not be a total tally.\n\u201cEPA is taking the reports of crop damage related to the use of dicamba very seriously,\u201d an EPA spokesperson said. \u201cWe are working with the states and the registrants to better understand the issue so we can address the problem of illegal drift. Considering the incidents that have been reported, we are reviewing the current use restrictions on the label to see what changes can be made so that unwanted exposures will not occur.\u201d\nRandles, the Bader attorney, said farmers are worried about continued damage. \u201cDicamba is a problem that could have been managed,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead they allowed it to become a catastrophe. They\u2019ve mismanaged this from start to finish.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge problem,\u201d said Kansas organic farmer Jack Geiger, who said his wheat, corn and soybean farm has been hit multiple times by dicamba drift. \u201cDicamba is going to make Roundup look like a tea party.\u201d\nIn a statement, BASF said: \u201cBASF believes that dicamba is safe when used correctly following the label instructions and stewardship guidelines and is an important tool for farmers who are increasingly battling resistant weeds.\n\u201cBASF and Monsanto are different entities and any effort to impute to BASF any misconduct by Monsanto is flatly wrong. In the recent trial, the jury made punitive damages findings against Monsanto, not BASF. For all the reasons that BASF has explained in court, BASF disagrees with the trial court\u2019s judgment that BASF should be responsible for Monsanto\u2019s conduct.\u201d\n This article was updated on Tuesday 31 March to clarify that the internal emails described in the fourth paragraph were from BASF and Monsanto.",

If this virus gets into the villages it will cause a huge amount of death,\u201d Mendon\u00e7a, said remembering how Brazil\u2019s Panar\u00e1 people were nearly wiped out in the early 1970s after the dictatorship bulldozed a road through their lands.\n\u201cWe are talking about true genocide,\u201d Mendon\u00e7a warned.\nAcross the region there are similar fears.\n\u201cIf coronavirus reached native populations the impact would be terrible,\u201d said Gregorio D\u00edaz Mirabal, the head of a regional network called the Indigenous Organisations of the Amazon Basin, which has advised communities to go into lockdown and evacuate outsiders.\n\u201cDue to our community-based way of life, the transmission would be very fast and the mortality would be extremely high,\u201d added D\u00edaz Mirabal, a member of the indigenous Kurripako people of Venezuela.\nSegundo Chukipiondo, a spokesman for Peru\u2019s Amazon indigenous federation, said it had urged the 2,000-plus communities it represents to close their borders.\nThe first South American community to self-isolate appears to have been Tawasap, a 70-strong settlement in Ecuador\u2019s southern Santiago Morona region.\nIn late February, weeks before Ecuador\u2019s president, Len\u00edn Moreno, ordered a nationwide lockdown, a Shuar indigenous leader called Tzamarenda Estalin placed a sign at his village\u2019s entrance that read: \u201cEntry forbidden as a health precaution.\u201d\n\u201cWe decided to shut our doors and not let anybody in or out \u2026 in order to care for our people,\u201d said Tzamarenda, 49.\nThe Shuar\u2019s 349 other villages, home to about 3,800 people, quickly followed suit. \u201cPandemics have hit us before \u2013 like influenza, measles and chickenpox \u2013 and they killed millions of people in Latin America,\u201d he said, echoing the fears of indigenous communities across the region.\nRecent studies show diseases such as smallpox and measles brought by European invaders may have wiped out up to 90% of the pre-Columbian population of the Americas \u2013 perhaps 55 million of an estimated 60 million people \u2013 between the late 15th and 17th centuries.\nTzamarenda, who traces his lineage to Kirup, a warrior leader who expelled both Incas and Spanish conquistadors from Shuar territory in the 16th century, said that risk meant Tawasap would stay closed until at least May.\n\u201cKnowing we can\u2019t cure ourselves because there is no cure, we have shut ourselves in,\u201d he told the Guardian by telephone. \u201cWe don\u2019t have masks or alcohol but we can use our medicinal plants to protect us.\u201d\nIn Colombia, which has confirmed 608 Covid-19 cases and six deaths, indigenous communities are also self-isolating, setting up roadblocks outside their reservations and outlawing visits to their ancestral lands.\nThe country is home to about 1.5 million indigenous citizens from 87 different tribes.\n\u201cOn Monday we held meetings and decided the best way to protect ourselves is to return to our lands,\u201d said Luis Fernando Arias, a coordinator for Colombia\u2019s national indigenous organization and member of the Kankuamo people from the Sierra Nevada mountain range on the Caribbean coast.\nIn Colombia\u2019s southern reaches, on the edge of the Amazon jungle, the semi-nomadic N\u00fckak community have also gone into isolation with 40 families \u2013 about 200 people \u2013 heading into two remote reservations hours from the nearest town.\n\u201cThese communities have taken the decision to isolate themselves,\u201d said Kelly Pe\u00f1a, who works for the national parks service in Guaviare, the province where the N\u00fckak live.\n\u201cBut many don\u2019t have phone signal or food supplies, so they are coordinating when they can with local government to organize deliveries.\n\u201cSome are still waiting for supplies before they go into isolation,\u201d Pe\u00f1a added.\nMendon\u00e7a, who works at S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s Federal University, said taking flight at a time of epidemic was a longstanding practice for South American indigenous communities, a survival technique passed down from generation to generation or acquired from personal suffering. \u201cThis is part of their ancestral memory,\u201d she said.\nBut such tactics \u2013 which were employed during 2016\u2019s H1N1 epidemic \u2013 also brought risks.\nIf those flocking back to remote villages from towns outside reserves were not properly quarantined or tested before returning it was possible they could carry coronavirus back home with them \u2013 with catastrophic effects.\n\u201cPeople are panicking. They are worried \u2013 and they want to go back,\u201d Mendon\u00e7a said. \u201cBut it is very important for there to be an isolation or quarantine process so you can [safely] return to your village, to your home. And this will require different strategies in each place.\u201d\nMendon\u00e7a said authorities also needed to act swiftly to expel outsiders such as thousands of wildcat goldminers from reserves like the Yanomami territory, straddling Brazil\u2019s border with Venezuela.\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t get these people out of the [indigenous] areas the chance of contagion is much greater,\u201d she said.\nKaiabi, who is head of the Xingu Indigenous Land Association, said he feared Brazil\u2019s specialized indigenous health system \u2013 which has faced dramatic cuts under the country\u2019s anti-indigenous president, Jair Bolsonaro \u2013 was \u201ctotally unequipped\u201d to deal with the coming coronavirus crisis.\nThat explained why xinguanos were now taking their own measures to block the advance of yet another deadly epidemic.\n\u201cThis is very dark part of our history,\u201d he said, \u201cand we don\u2019t want a repeat.\u201d",

        "content": "Scheduling football before restrictions end would be a nightmare as telling fans not to attend matches will not keep them away\nEngland has hosted only a handful of senior competitive behind-closed-doors football fixtures and anyone who considers them a suitable and workable solution to the problems now facing sport could probably do with a reminder about how the previous ones went down, starting with the first. This, at least, is a chapter of British sporting history that anyone can be forgiven for forgetting, since it took place 105 years ago.\nIn March 1915 Bradford City, one of two Bradford clubs in the First Division at the time, met Norwich City of the Southern League in the third round of the FA Cup. They first played in Yorkshire, drawing 1-1 after extra time, and when the match was replayed the following weekend at The Nest, then Norwich\u2019s home ground, it finished goalless. A second replay was thus required, and arranged for a neutral venue \u2013 Lincoln City volunteered \u2013 but with a caveat.\n\u201cThere is a condition, made by the FA, that is not to be overlooked in connection with the Lincoln match \u2013 namely, that the public are not to be admitted,\u201d reported the Lincolnshire Echo after the game had been arranged. \u201cThe obvious object of this is that workmen shall not be drawn away from their employment in war time, especially if engaged, as so many firms are, on government work. Wednesday\u2019s match at Sincil Bank, therefore, will be played behind closed gates.\u201d\nA match held on a weekday afternoon between teams who had produced only two goals over four hours of effort, played between 75 and 100 miles from either of their home grounds and from which supporters were officially banned would not, you would think, prove much of a draw. But when matchday came, so did people. \u201cDespite the prohibition of the public, the reserved stand was pretty well filled with spectators, though hundreds remained outside the gates and all entrances to the ground were guarded by police,\u201d said the Echo. Journalists and club officials had been allowed in, along with several hundred off-duty and wounded soldiers but many more were locked outside.\nThe game started. It didn\u2019t sound much fun. \u201cThe ground churned up a good deal, and the players presented black figures before the interval was reached,\u201d reported the Echo. \u201cIt looked as though there was little prospect of a goal at either end.\u201d\nGoalless it remained as the players went in at half-time, which is when everything went wrong. \u201cThe main gates had been rocking somewhat ominously at different periods through the half,\u201d wrote the Echo, while \u201cthe crowd outside had begun to tear down the boards near the main gates, and in three or four places on the Sincil Bank side, and would soon have broken through\u201d.\nEventually the crush of people outside the ground, and the damage they were inflicting to it, was such that the gates were opened and \u201ca human tide (including several ladies) poured in\u201d.\nThe Yorkshire Evening Post reported \u201cbarriers were placed against the doors, and a few police guarded them with threatening mien, but eventually the obstacles were broken down \u2026 and the police contented themselves with taking the names of a few men who had declined to be overawed by the majesty of the law.\u201d\nNobody was overawed by the majesty of the football, though the game was eventually brought to a scruffy conclusion. Jimmy McDonald put Bradford ahead \u201cin the middle of a scrimmage\u201d in the 78th minute, and Dickie Bond added a second from the penalty spot with the last kick of the game. Norwich were out of the Cup and behind-closed-doors matches were out of favour.\nThe lesson learned in Lincoln more than a century ago and reinforced much more recently in Paris, Valencia and elsewhere in the days before the complete shutdown of professional football \u2013 when thousands of fans gathered outside locked grounds to give their side some sightless support \u2013 is that when a significant match is on telling people they can\u2019t come in will not keep them away.\nThe only way to manage that is to play it in secret, which is difficult to accomplish when televising it is a key part of the business plan. Many of us are more determined now to avoid large gatherings than we were a month or even a week ago but not everyone is so acquiescent and scheduling a significant football match anywhere before restrictions completely end, even if nobody manages to force the gates, would be an incitement to congregate and a nightmare to police.\nThere have only been a handful of behind-closed-doors games in England since 1915, including two FA Cup replays after the initial meeting was marred by a non-league side\u2019s goalkeeper being struck on the head by an object thrown from the crowd.\nThe first of those came in 1985 when Leicester side featuring an attack of Gary Lineker and Alan Smith were drawing 1-1 with Burton Albion, then of England\u2019s seventh tier, when Paul Evans, a solicitor, was knocked unconscious by a flying piece of wood.\nThey went on to win 6-1 but the FA ordered a fan-free replay, which was set for Derby on 14 January, rescheduled for Coventry two days later because of a frozen pitch, and finally played in front of an audience described in the Guardian as being composed of \u201cFA and club officials, press, radio, television, ballboys, groundstaff, police and two members of the public who managed to find a way in\u201d.\nThis time the Foxes won 1-0. \u201cIt might sound unprofessional but I\u2019m glad Leicester won because none of this was their fault,\u201d said the Burton manager, a then-obscure but already eminently quotable 36-year-old chiropodist by the name of Neil Warnock, who added that in a near-silent stadium the ability to clearly hear each other had helped his players: \u201cWe have to talk to each other on the pitch because when you\u2019re part-timers you\u2019re sometimes a little bit slower upstairs.\u201d\nHis opposite number, Gordon Milne, was less pleased with how the affair was handled. \u201cThe crowd is part of the game and you can\u2019t perform without them \u2013 they go together,\u201d he snarled. \u201cIt\u2019s unfair to ask teams to play in that environment and I wouldn\u2019t like to think any professional side will be asked to do that again.\u201d\nIt is a conclusion worth bearing in mind, lest in its desperation to find a way out of its predicament football makes Milnes of us all.",

        "content": "Businesses that have suffered sharp downturn are eligible for wage subsidies of $1,500 a fortnight per employee for up to six months\nThe Australian government has earmarked $130bn towards wage subsidies over the next six months in an extraordinary bid to stave off further job losses as the economy faces a sharp downtown during the coronavirus pandemic.\nUp to 6m workers could be eligible for wage subsidies of $1,500 per fortnight, which the Australian Tax Office will pay directly to businesses that have suffered sharp drops in turnover. Such businesses will required to pay at least that amount to workers \u2013 including those who have been stood down since 1 March.\nScott Morrison described the measure as an \u201ceconomic lifeline\u201d at a time when the nation was fighting twin battles \u201cagainst a virus and against the economic ruin that it can threaten\u201d.\nThe prime minister warned that the disruption caused by the pandemic was such that many countries would see their economies collapse in the months ahead.\n\u201cWe could see countries themselves fall into chaos \u2013 this will not be Australia,\u201d Morrison told reporters in Canberra on Monday. \u201cWe will get Australians through this, with uniquely Australian solutions to deal with the unique Australian challenges we face here.\u201d\nMorrison confirmed parliament would have to be recalled to pass the legislation, possibly as soon as next week.\nThe announcement came as officials confirmed that Tasmania and ACT had experienced their first Covid-19 related deaths.\nAs of Monday afternoon, there have been 4,245 confirmed cases of the illness across Australia with 18 deaths.\nThe deputy chief medical officer, professor Paul Kelly, said while there had been a decrease in the daily growth in cases, it was \u201cnot a time to take the foot off the brake\u201d as attempts must continue to slow the spread of the virus. He said 55 people remained in intensive care units at present. Kelly also committed to release more detail about the modelling that underpins the government\u2019s health measures, after growing calls for the rationale to be explained at length.\nMorrison was due to have another teleconference with state and territory leaders on Monday evening, just a day after the national cabinet agreed to tougher restrictions on social interactions, including limiting gatherings with others outside the household to two people.\nThe new $1,500 JobKeeper payment is an about-face for the Morrison government, which resisted union calls for a wage subsidy until employer groups joined the push last week, warning that the previous economic stimulus packages were not enough to support Australians\u2019 jobs.\nThe new wages subsidy aims to help employers maintain relationships with employees, even as increasingly strict restrictions force more and more businesses \u2013 particularly retail and hospitality - to shut their doors.\nAffected businesses are those that suffer a drop in turnover of at least 30% - or at least 50% in the case of large employers with more than $1bn of turnover.\nThe government says the flat payment of $1,500 per fortnight will be available for full and part time workers, sole traders, and casuals who have been with an employer for 12 months or more.\n\u201cWe want to keep the engine of our economy running through this crisis,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cIt may run on idle for a time but it must continue to run.\u201d\nThe treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, said the wages subsidy built on other economic stimulus and support measures announced over the past month.\n\u201cAt a cost of $130bn over the next six months, we are providing support to the Australian worker like never before,\u201d he said. \u201cExtraordinary times call for extraordinary measures.\u201d\nAs the coronavirus crisis has led to tighter and tighter restrictions, including forced shutdowns of certain businesses, the government has had to dramatically ratchet up the level of support to prop up the economy and support laid-off workers.\nJust over one week ago, the government announced an effective doubling of the jobseeker payment, previously known as Newstart, over the next six months, which prompted long queues to form outside Centrelink offices across the country.\nOn Monday the secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Sally McManus, revealed that the union body believed 1m workers had been stood down or laid off since the start of the crisis, while the Centre for Future Work estimated the figure could rise to more than 2m within weeks, pushing unemployment to 20%.\nThe OECD has estimated that Covid-19 shutdowns could see 22% of Australia\u2019s economic activity directly lost due to shutdowns.\nIt assumed a full shutdown in the arts, entertainment, recreation, transport manufacturing and other personal service sectors; declines of three-quarters of activity in hotels, restaurants, air travel, retail and wholesale trade; and declines of one half in construction and professional service activities.\nMcManus told reporters a $1,500 fortnightly payment was \u201chighly inadequate\u201d. The ACTU has lobbied for workers to receive a subsidy of 80% of their former wage, up to a cap of 80% of the median wage, or $1,375 a week.\nMcManus also took aim at the \u201csimply bad communication by governments, state and federal, that led to panic\u201d among employers.\nThe Morrison government had suggested employers \u201ccould let people go and they\u2019d be looked after by the social security system\u201d while state governments had suggested that some employers were not essential, she said.\n\u201c[It] was a bit bungled really ... and we woke up to a whole lot of workplaces standing down or just sacking their employees.\u201d\nOn Monday the shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, promised Labor would support \u201cany additional measures which will get more help to more Australians more quickly\u201d - but warned while it would be constructive it would not be \u201csilent\u201d.\n\u201cWhere there are obvious gaps or where there are obvious flaws or where there is a lack of urgency, we will make those points as well,\u201d he said.\nChalmers said wage subsidies had been delayed because the Coalition had dismissed \u201csometimes ridiculing, the good ideas that Labor and others in our community, the unions, have put forward\u201d.\nThe government also confirmed on Monday that it would temporarily ease the partner income test that applies to the JobSeeker Payment. It will now be available to eligible people so long as their partner earns less than $79,762 a year. Previously it was set around $48,000, meaning that many recently laid-off workers would have missed out on the payment.",

        "content": "Continuing the series where writers recommend underappreciated films available to stream, a call to watch and admire Tom Hardy\u2019s single-location masterwork\nAt first glance, Stephen Knight\u2019s 2013 single location road movie Locke might seem like an antithetical quarantine watch. The plot, which revolves around a concrete pour, and takes place entirely within the claustrophobic confines of a slate grey BMW X5, is not exactly escapist fare for those negotiating the mundanity of life under lockdown. Yet 85 minutes trapped in a car with Tom Hardy turns out to be a transfixing, transporting experience.\nWritten and directed by Knight (whose screenwriting credits include Stephen Frears\u2019 Dirty Pretty Things and David Cronenberg\u2019s Eastern Promises), the minimalism of its design lends itself particularly well to low-key, at home viewing. Hardy is Ivan Locke, a construction manager driving from Birmingham to London on a Friday night. A series of phone calls conducted over his car\u2019s Bluetooth speaker reveal that Ivan is en route to the hospital, where an ill-advised one-night stand is about to give birth. If things weren\u2019t high pressure enough, his wife and kids are waiting for him at home, and in the morning he\u2019s supposed to oversee \u201cthe biggest single concrete pour in all of history, outside wartime\u201d. He must coordinate 218 trucks and 55 metric tonnes of wet concrete. Remotely. \u201cThis morning, I had a job, a wife and my children. Now all I have is this phone, and this car,\u201d Ivan mourns. The set-up is lo-fi, but Hardy manages to make the stakes feel huge.\nPremiering out of competition at the Venice film festival, Locke was a hit with critics if not exactly a box office smash. The film was released as Hardy was exploding into mainstream Hollywood, a year after his turn as Bane in Christopher Nolan\u2019s The Dark Knight Rises. Hindsight makes watching action hero Hardy descend into a controlled, sweaty panic (while kitted out in cozy knitwear) its own odd thrill. The actor was not yet Mad Max or Venom, and so it\u2019s fun watching him so fully inhabit such an unshowy role, actorly seriousness uncorrupted by star power. Hardy is bolstered by voicework from actors whose respective celebrity pedigrees have also since grown, including Bafta-winner Olivia Colman, Spider-Man\u2019s Tom Holland, and Fleabag\u2019s Andrew \u201cHot Priest\u201d Scott, who is particularly dynamic as Ivan\u2019s drunken second-in-command Donal. Mainly though, it\u2019s a one man show on the road; for the duration of the film, Hardy\u2019s face is the only one we see on screen. That he\u2019s able to create so much drama while working with so little is a feat of economy.\nIt helps, of course, that Ivan is so specific on the page. A control freak in a jumper, he is a meticulous master planner and an agent of his own destiny. \u201cYou don\u2019t trust God when it comes to concrete,\u201d he insists. Which of course, makes it funnier, and all the more tragic as his iron-fisted grasp begins to slip.\nIvan\u2019s response to the chaos unfolding around him, all of which is of his own making, is exasperated but unfeeling pragmatism. \u201cThe traffic is fine, so it\u2019ll be OK,\u201d he reassures himself. When baby mama Bethan (Olivia Colman), 5cm dilated, asks if he loves her, he dodges the question, coldly suggesting that she likely asked \u201cbecause she\u2019s in pain or something\u201d. Quite incredibly, he never apologises to wife Katrina (Ruth Wilson) for his infidelity. He shoulders responsibility without ever accepting blame. In work and life, \u201cI\u2019ll fix it\u201d becomes his refrain. The American film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum thinks of the film as an \u201cexistential western that essentially focuses on the hero\u2019s endurance\u201d. I like to think of Ivan Locke as more of an antihero \u2013 a fascinating, credible study of an unlikable, emotionally repressed modern man.\nThe film is a favourite of my friend Ashley Clark, the director of programming at arthouse cinema BamCinematek in Brooklyn, New York, who had scheduled a special screening as part of a series \u201cOn Solitude\u201d and has described it as \u201cthe most keenly-observed film ever made about a strain of absurdly intransigent, peculiarly maudlin British masculinity\u201d. The film\u2019s sense of humour is distinctly, drily British, too. Hardy adopts a lilting Welsh accent, delivering lines like \u201cDo it for the concrete!\u201d in earnest. \u201cI\u2019m in an Indian restaurant!\u201d shouts council head Cassidy (Danny Webb), barely audible over the din of curry house chatter. It is Friday night, after all.\nLocke is available on Netflix in the US and Amazon Prime in the UK",

It will be spent over the next six months.\nThis kind of investment is staggering \u2013 bigger than the annual health and education budgets combined.\nWe are losing a sense of the scale of these interventions because they are coming so thick and fast, the billions cascading into one another. But this is truly staggering.\nThe shapeshift of this particular Coalition government is also staggering.\nWhen the Reserve Bank spent months last year trying to persuade this government to unleash some stimulus to help the sputtering pre-pandemic economy, Morrison and the treasurer Josh Frydenberg said, repeatedly, talk to the hand. We\u2019ve gone from \u201conly panic merchants do stimulus\u201d to $130bn flying out the door in six months, few questions asked.\nYou\u2019d say the current behaviour displays all the zeal of the convert, and that observation would be entirely true and valid, except it doesn\u2019t really deliver the required insight.\nMorrison made it clear on Monday why the government was acting, and acting on this scale. Events demand a new rulebook. We are all on the brink, Australia, and the rest of the world, and this Covid-19 pandemic has put us there.\nThe only thing that stands between all of us and the worst-case scenario is continued physical distancing, and massive fiscal firepower.\n\u201cMany countries in the months ahead and perhaps beyond that may well see their economies collapse,\u201d the prime minister warned reporters. \u201cSome may see them hollow out in the very worst of circumstances, we could see countries themselves fall into chaos\u201d. The prime minister insisted Australia would be different. \u201cThis will not be Australia.\u201d\nThe government did not want to go down the path of wage subsidies initially. It resisted the idea. But with Australia\u2019s two most populous states pulling inexorably in the direction of lockdowns, with employers screaming for help, and job losses mounting everyday, wage subsidies is where the centre of gravity ultimately rested.\nOver the past week or so, Morrison has begun framing his conceptual task. He wants to put the economy to sleep for six months. In preparing for that end point, he wants to make sure as many people as possible remain connected to their livelihoods to try and prevent unemployment carnage on the other side.\nIf people can remain connected to their jobs, and if businesses can hibernate and return in the spring with as few accumulated liabilities as possible, then the economic damage associated with this event is more likely transient than permanent.\nThis is the working theory in any case, and it is sound as far as it goes.\nThe main problem is nobody knows whether the pandemic will conform to the arbitrary six-month timeframe the government is currently putting on it both for fiscal reasons and to try and manage the country through the various transitions of the crisis without creating panic.\nWill Morrison be back here in another six months, with another $130bn?\nHow deep is this fiscal hole and how do we begin to recover in a budgetary sense after this shock? Honestly, who knows, and right now that is the least of our problems.\nBusiness has largely welcomed Monday\u2019s wage subsidy announcement, while reserving the right to nitpick as the proposal is turned into legislation over the coming week or so. There will be nitpicking, sure as night follows day.\nFrom the point of view of employees, this will obviously be comfort.\nBut there are questions.\nCasual workers need to have been working regularly for same employer for 12 months or more to qualify for the new wage subsidy. How many casual workers will be in this position? Some will of course, but I suspect many casuals won\u2019t, given the nature of casual work. New Zealanders in Australia are eligible for help but other workers on temporary visas aren\u2019t. These poor people remain in limbo, at risk of destitution.\nThis scheme does give Australian workers a shot of seeing out this crisis while still remaining connected to their employers. That\u2019s sound policy-making.\nBut there are no guarantees of what will happen after this pandemic passes. There is no guarantee employers will emerge from this crisis and roll back into business as usual, with their workforces intact, without skipping a beat.\nIn fact there is only one thing we can guarantee about this crisis.\nThere are no guarantees.",

        "content": "Primaries have been delayed and conventions are in question as calls for voting by mail raise concerns of their own\nWhen Spelman College announced this month it was suspending in-person classes and closing residence halls in response to coronavirus, Ashee Groce, a junior, had a question: how would she vote?\nGroce, who serves as president of Young Democrats of America at Spelman, had registered herself and a number of fellow students in the Atlanta area. But they had now lost their housing and would have to return home before Georgia\u2019s presidential primary.\nOn a press call for the not-for-profit Rock the Vote, Groce said she was grateful Georgia was one of the states that have delayed their primaries, giving her more time to figure out how to cast a ballot, but those decisions have sparked their own set of concerns.\nAs the coronavirus outbreak spreads across America, it is wreaking havoc in an election year as Democrats pick a champion to try to oust Donald Trump from the White House.\nBut at least 15 Democratic primaries have now been delayed because of coronavirus, essentially freezing the Democratic nominating contest \u2013 currently dominated by the former vice-president Joe Biden. While state officials scramble to find safe ways for voters to cast their ballots, voting rights advocates warn that lawmakers will have to do considerable work to ensure the pandemic does not derail the presidential election.\nThe delayed primaries are admittedly unlikely to change the final outcome of the Democratic race, considering Biden\u2019s significant delegate lead over his rival, the democratic socialist senator Bernie Sanders. But the country\u2019s necessary focus on coronavirus has left Biden mostly on the sidelines as he tries to pivot to his likely match-up against Donald Trump in November. The status of the party\u2019s summer nominating convention also appears to be up in the air, which could rob Biden of another key opportunity to make his pitch to voters to choose him over Trump.\nAsked last week whether the convention should be canceled, Biden said no. \u201cI don\u2019t think it should be called off, and I don\u2019t think we should call off any of the elections,\u201d the candidate told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper. \u201cI think we just have to move forward. We may have to use different means and methods. There\u2019s an awful lot of direct mail voting going on right now, which may be one of the answers.\u201d\nThe Democratic National Committee chairman, Tom Perez, sent a similar message this month after Ohio canceled in-person voting at the last minute over concerns about spreading coronavirus at polling places. Perez said in a statement that states should focus on expanding no-excuse absentee voting and vote by mail \u201cinstead of moving primaries to later in the cycle, when timing around the virus remains unpredictable\u201d.\nDemocrats, who have long pushed for more absentee voter options, said the 17 March primaries in Florida, Illinois and Arizona demonstrated the need to expand such efforts in the face of coronavirus. Illinois, which relies mostly on in-person voting, saw a 25% decrease in turnout that was largely attributed to voters\u2019 concerns about the spread of coronavirus. But Florida and Arizona, which both have robust early voting and vote by mail operations, actually saw increases in overall turnout.\nSean Eldridge, the founder of the progressive group Stand Up America, said postponing primaries was unavoidable because so many states lack appropriate voting protocols to deal with such crises. \u201cI think every state is going to have to make that choice right now, but the problem is too many states are not prepared for this moment,\u201d Eldridge said.\nEldridge\u2019s group drove more than 70,000 constituent calls to lawmakers urging them to include funding to expand no-excuse absentee voting and vote by mail in the $2tn coronavirus package.\n\u201cNone of us know how long this pandemic is going to last, and we need to make sure every single eligible voter is able to cast their ballot,\u201d Eldridge said. \u201cIf Congress provides sufficient funding to the states, then states can put that infrastructure in place now to address the coronavirus pandemic but also to be prepared for future events that could disrupt future elections.\u201d\nBut experts emphasize that states will need to develop a safe in-person voting option to ensure fair elections in the months to come.\nCertain people, such as those who are homeless or living on a Native American reservation, may not have reliable access to mail, so an entirely mail-based election could leave them behind.\n\u201cThere are these communities that get already wronged by our system, and they\u2019re already getting underresourced,\u201d said Myrna Perez, the director of the voting rights and elections program at the Brennan Center for Justice. \u201cRelying on the mail in that way would just bake in those existing inequalities.\u201d\nPerez urged states to set rigorous sanitization standards for polling sites and ensure voters can practice social distancing while casting in-person ballots, so Americans can protect their health while voting.\n\u201cWe need many, many different options ready to go because we\u2019re going to have many diverse communities that need to get served, and there\u2019s not going to be one way that is able to serve them all,\u201d Perez said.\nThe Brennan Center has estimated it will cost up to $2bn to ensure the fairness of elections during the pandemic, but the coronavirus stimulus bill allocates only $400mn for election assistance. Voting rights advocates and Democratic lawmakers described the funding as an encouraging sign, especially considering Senate Republicans allocated $140m for election assistance in their initial proposal, but they say they are not done fighting for a more robust response.\n\u201cWe all know that this pandemic has been a threat to our economy, to our health and to our democracy,\u201d Eldridge said. \u201cIt\u2019s important that Congress respond on all three of those fronts.\u201d",

        "content": "Despite hundreds of Covid-19 cases, governor has refused to order shelter-in-place and has barred localities from acting on their own\nUpdate: On Monday afternoon, Arizona governor Doug Ducey issued a stay-at-home order until 30 April. The order directs residents to stay at home unless they are engaged in essential activities. The list of essential services that may remain open includes golf courses and hair salons. \u201cThe time for further action is now,\u201d Ducey said. \u201cStay home, stay healthy and stay connected.\u201d\nFor the last three weeks, 57-year-old Ann O\u2019Connor has avoided leaving her home in Paradise Valley, Arizona, due to the Covid-19 pandemic. As a cancer survivor with asthma, she is considered high risk for severe illness, and she wants to do her part to stop the virus\u2019s rapid spread.\nBut others here are not taking the same precautions. O\u2019Connor\u2019s house looks on to a private golf course, and she spends her days watching foursomes tee off, buy refreshments and pile into golf carts. She sees neighbors greet each other with hugs.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really disconcerting because you just see these people and there\u2019s no social distancing,\u201d O\u2019Connor said in a phone interview from her home. \u201cIt is like a huge, sick experiment,\u201d she added about the lack of consistent action across the country.\nO\u2019Connor has children living in Washington, California and Colorado, where governors have issued statewide shelter-in-place orders and shut down all but essential businesses. She had expected it would just be a matter of time before the rest of the country followed suit.\nBut while more than 25 states and dozens of counties have ordered residents to stay home, 10 states, including Arizona, Arkansas, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming, have no such orders at the state, county or city level.\n\u201cMany of you have asked if or when the state will move towards a stay-at-home policy,\u201d Arizona\u2019s governor, Doug Ducey, a Republican, said at a 23 March press conference. \u201cThe answer is, not at this time.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cThe CDC is not there yet. Arizona is not there yet. We\u2019re not at the same stage as other states.\u201d\nDucey has barred cities and counties from issuing their own shelter-in-place orders, a move which has frustrated mayors in the state who would like to take more aggressive steps.\nThe governor has closed Arizona schools and libraries statewide and ended elective surgeries. In counties with confirmed cases of Covid-19, he has ordered movie theaters, gyms and bars to close, and restaurants to switch to takeout. But other non-essential businesses are open, and the governor has named dozens of \u201cessential\u201d businesses that cannot be ordered to close even if he issues a shelter-in-place order.\nHis list of essential businesses includes golf courses and \u201cpersonal hygiene services\u201d, which has been interpreted to include barbers, hairdressers and nail salons.\nGregg Gonsalves, a professor of epidemiology at the Yale school of public health, said Ducey\u2019s approach was inconsistent with mainstream public health guidance. Stay-at-home orders don\u2019t just protect residents, public health experts say, but are crucial to slowing down the spread of Covid-19 so an explosion of infections does not overwhelm hospitals with limited beds, ventilators and personal protective equipment for doctors.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no virtue in waiting,\u201d Gonsalves said. \u201cSocial distancing and business closures are meant to be a preventative. They\u2019re not to be seen as something you do when it gets really bad \u2013 it\u2019s to keep it from getting really bad.\u201d\nAs of Sunday morning, Arizona had 919 confirmed Covid-19 cases, up 18% from the day before. But that is likely to be a severe undercount. Due to testing delays and shortages, fewer than 14,000 tests had been conducted in the state, which is home to more than 7 million.\n\u201cI am very concerned that we are behind the curve on this one,\u201d said Dr Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association. Too many communities were thinking \u201cit\u2019s not here yet, we have time\u201d, Benjamin said, when instead they should be trying to \u201cget ahead of it in a defensive manner\u201d.\nLeyna Negron, a salon owner, called it \u201cridiculous\u201d to classify beauty salons as essential.\n\u201cWe cannot comply with CDC guidelines and stay six feet away from our clients,\u201d Negron said. She does facials and nails at her salon in Apache Junction, 30 miles east of Phoenix. \u201cI have many elderly clients and I don\u2019t want to put them at risk.\u201d\nShe has decided to voluntarily close after 14 years in business. But she said it would have been easier had the governor made the call to shut everyone down.\n\u201cI just want to know what to do and what help is coming,\u201d Negron said.\nAt a time when more than 3 million Americans have filed for unemployment, Arizonans whose workplaces remain open say they feel lucky to still have jobs. But they are also fearful about the risk of working.\nRicardo Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, a 28-year-old college student, said a pre-existing health condition made him nervous about continuing to deliver flowers for a large company, \u201cbut I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll simply be replaced and not have a job at all when this situation is over if I choose to stay home\u201d.\nHe\u2019d like to see politicians shut down all non-essential businesses.\n\u201cWe should already have been locked down,\u201d said Parris Wallace, a 34-year-old director of a Phoenix not-for-profit organization. She has spent the past 10 days overcoming symptoms that are consistent with Covid-19.\nIn a phone interview from her house, where she is quarantined, Wallace\u2019s voice was still raspy as she described gasping for air, a burning sensation in her lungs, fever and extreme fatigue. She will not receive her Covid-19 test results for several more days.\nThe latest guidance from state health officials discourages primary care providers from testing patients, because there are \u201cnot enough supplies to meet testing demand\u201d. Patients whose symptoms are severe enough to seek care at a hospital are prioritized, which was the case for Wallace. But without more widespread testing, she worries, Arizonans do not have a sense of how pervasively the disease is spreading.\n\u201cLike, knowing what I know, and going through it, I just cannot stress enough to people: just stay home, stay indoors,\u201d Wallace said.\nDr JulieAnn Heathcott, a Scottsdale OB-GYN, started a Change.org petition urging Ducey to \u201cLockdown Arizona\u201d.\nThe petition had earned more than 163,000 signatures as of Sunday morning.\nBut opponents like Rhiannon Zarr, who owns a painting company in the Phoenix area, are hoping more people will go back to work soon. \u201cI do believe Americans have now learned how to clean, sanitize and distance ourselves to a safe limited area,\u201d Zarr said.\nSome officials have even second-guessed the closures that have happened, sending mixed signals to residents.\nLast week, a leading public health official in Arizona\u2019s largest county announced she would not have recommended closing schools, libraries and restaurants.\n\u201cI would try to minimize spread, maximize distance, but keep facilities open because I think this is going to be a long haul,\u201d said Dr Rebecca Sunenshine, the Maricopa county department of public health\u2019s medical director for disease control, at a public meeting on 23 March.\nAdding to the chaos, the state emergency management director resigned this weekend, citing a \u201clack of communication and transparency\u201d in Arizona\u2019s Covid-19 response, according to the Arizona Republic.\nMeanwhile, some mayors in the state are growing restless. The city of Tucson has called on Ducey to issue a statewide shelter-in-place order.\nRegina Romero, the Tucson mayor, ordered all businesses in her city not designated as essential by the governor to close and recommended salons and barbers do the same. \u201cWe cannot afford to wait any longer,\u201d she said in a 27 March statement. \u201cCovid-19 is not waiting and neither can we.\u201d",

        "content": "Asymptomatic people may be infecting others despite officials saying risk of this is low\nTwo weekends ago, Wang, a 59-year old cleaner who works at a library in Henan province, accompanied her former classmate Zhang home for China\u2019s tomb-sweeping holiday, when families tend to the graves of their ancestors. She met Zhang, a local doctor, at a bus stop and the two drove out to the countryside. They shared three meals together.\nOn Tuesday last week, Wang developed a cough and two days later, a fever. Her son took her to hospital where she was tested for Covid-19. On Saturday, she became not only the first person in her province in 30 days to catch coronavirus via local transmission, but one of the country\u2019s few new infections.\nWang\u2019s case, detailed by Henan\u2019s health commission, has raised alarm because of the possibility she contracted the virus from Zhang, an asymptomatic or \u201csilent\u201d carrier. These are people who officials have repeatedly said pose a low risk of contagion and who are not reflected in the government\u2019s published tally of confirmed cases.\nOn Wednesday, Zhang and two other doctors in Jia county in Pingdeshan tested positive for the virus but had no symptoms. All three had shared a meal together on 13 March after one of the group had been quarantined for 14 days as a precautionary measure after returning from Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak.\nAs China relaxes lockdown measures and people return to work, they are concerned about the possibility that asymptomatic carriers will continue spreading the virus. For the last two weeks, health authorities have reported an almost zero rate of local transmission of the virus, with almost all new cases coming in from outside the country. But critics say officials are downplaying the outbreak by not including asymptomatic cases.\nChina has not released data for the number of asymptomatic cases, but Chinese researchers estimated that 59% of those who contracted the virus had mild or no symptoms. Documents seen by the South China Morning Post reportedly showed more than 40,000 asymptomatic patients that would not have been included in China\u2019s total number of infections of more than 80,000.\nSuch patients, usually found by tracing the contacts of confirmed cases, are quarantined for 14 days and released if they do not show any symptoms. But the number of reports of new cases has started to worry the public, as well as authorities who pledged on Monday to step up prevention and control of such infections.\n\u201cThis case is not the only one. Everyone thinks there is no hidden danger and that the only risk is the imported infections from abroad,\u201d wrote one commentator online, in response to the new infection in Henan. \u201cSo-called low-risk areas are not to be believed. Bureaucrats everywhere have already begun covering up,\u201d another said.\nIn an editorial on Sunday, the financial news magazine Caixin called on the government to publish data on asymptomatic carriers. \u201cWithin China, transmission caused by asymptomatic infections has occurred many times. The number needs to be made public as soon as possible. Investigation and and research is needed to raise the public\u2019s alertness,\u201d it said.\nSince 18 March there have been five confirmed cases of asymptomatic infection in Dongguan in Guangdong province, a major manufacturing hub. Last week, authorities formally arrested a man in Beijing who was diagnosed as an asymptomatic carrier in mid-February. He repeatedly visited grocery stores, pharmacies and other public places against regulations. His mother has been infected and 20 other close contacts have now been quarantined.\nTwo recently confirmed patients, one in Gansu province and one in Guangdong province, had both previously been in Xianning county in Hubei where no locally transmitted cases have been reported since late February. This has led to conjecture that they contracted the virus from asymptomatic carriers in the area.\nAuthorities have now tracked down 15 people in close contact with Wang in Henan, and 53 people who could have been infected by the three doctors have now been quarantined.\nThe government has tried to assure the public. China\u2019s top respiratory disease expert Zhong Nanshan told the state broadcaster CGTN that while asymptomatic patients who have been in close contact with confirmed patients can be \u201cvery infective\u201d, he did not believe they posed a \u201cbig problem\u201d in China.\n\u201cI suppose we don\u2019t have too many asymptomatic patients. If we did, they would be transmitting to other people and pushing the number higher,\u201d he said.\nChinese premier Li Keqiang chaired a meeting where he said the government would step up prevention and control of asymptomatic infections, through screening, quarantines and tracking contacts of confirmed cases, according to state media on Monday. Last week, he called on health officials to investigate whether asymptomatic people were contagious, in order to help the country\u2019s ongoing prevention plans, and ordered officials \u201cnot to cover up\u201d cases.\nBut the infectious disease expert Zhang Wenhong, said at a symposium on Friday that asymptomatic carriers would continue to pose a major risk, even as China took measures, such as temporarily banning foreigners from entering the country.\n\u201cNow, we only allow Chinese people to come back. But when our country\u2019s doors open again, there will be large numbers coming in. When they are asymptomatic, the risk is great.\u201d\nAdditional reporting by Wu Pei Lin",

        "content": "Plans criticised amid fears countries may use coronavirus crisis to rein in commitments\nJapan has laid out its plans to tackle greenhouse gas emissions under the Paris agreement in the run-up to UN climate talks this year, becoming the first large economy to do so.\nBut its proposals were criticised by campaigners as grossly inadequate, amid fears the Covid-19 crisis could prompt countries to try to water down their climate commitments.\nThe UK, which will host the talks, hopes every country will produce renewed targets on curbing emissions and achieving net zero carbon by 2050.\nNew commitments are needed to achieve the Paris goals of holding temperature rises to no more than 2C, and ideally 1.5C, above pre-industrial levels, as on current national targets the world would far exceed those limits.\nFor almost three decades, world governments have met every year to forge a global response to the climate emergency. Under the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, every country on earth is treaty-bound to \u201cavoid dangerous climate change\u201d, and find ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions globally in an equitable way. Cop stands for conference of the parties under the UNFCCC.\nThe UK will host Cop26 this November in Glasgow. In the Paris agreement of 2015, all governments agreed for the first time\u00a0to limit global heating to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels, and set out non-binding national targets on greenhouse gases to achieve that. However, these targets are insufficient, and if allowed to stand would lead to an estimated 3C of heating, which scientists say would spell disaster. For that reason, the Cop26 talks in Glasgow are viewed as the last chance for global cooperation on the emergency, with countries expected to come with tough new targets on emissions.\nThe negotiations will be led by environment ministers and civil servants, aided by UN officials. Nearly every country is expected to send a voting representative at the level of environment secretary or equivalent, and the big economies will have extensive delegations.\nEach of the 196 nations on earth, bar a few failed states, is a signatory to the UNFCCC foundation treaty. The Cops, for all their flaws, are the only forum on the climate crisis in which the opinions and concerns of the poorest country carry equal weight to that of the biggest economies, such as the US and China. Agreement can only come by consensus, which gives Cop decisions global authority.\nFiona Harvey\u00a0Environment correspondent\nJapan\u2019s carbon targets \u2013 known as its nationally determined contribution (NDC) in the UN jargon \u2013 as announced on Monday morning are almost unchanged from its commitments made in 2015 towards the Paris accord, however.\nThe country\u2019s target of a 26% reduction in emissions by 2030, based on 2013 levels, is rated as \u201chighly insufficient\u201d by the Climate Action Tracker analysis, meaning that if all targets were at this level, temperature rises would exceed 3C.\nThe country, the world\u2019s fifth biggest emitter and third biggest economy, is one of the only developed countries still building new coal-fired power stations, although there are signs it may hold back.\nJapan\u2019s energy systems were thrown into turmoil by the accident at the Fukushima nuclear plant in 2011, after which the country shut its many nuclear reactors. The country\u2019s politics have also been affected by intensified competition from neighbouring China, which overtook Japan as the world\u2019s second largest economy in 2010.\nOnce a strong proponent of climate action \u2013 and proud of the 1997 Kyoto protocol signed under its auspices \u2013 Japan in recent years has appeared lukewarm in its commitments at a succession of UN meetings, before and since the landmark Paris conference of 2015.\nCampaigners fear the coronavirus pandemic will be seen by some countries as a way to weaken their commitment to the Paris accord and present less stringent targets instead of the strong cuts needed.\n\u201cJapan should not slow down climate actions even amid the Covid-19 global fights, and must revisit and strengthen this plan swiftly in order to be in line with the Paris agreement,\u201d said Kimiko Hirata, the international director of the Kiko Network, a climate group in Japan.\nShe added that the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, appeared content \u201cto settle for a low target and policies to continue to fund coal, which are firmly taking us down the path to economic and environmental ruin\u201d.\nKat Kramer, the global climate lead at Christian Aid, said of the latest Japanese plan: \u201cThe fact they are smuggling it out during a global pandemic, when it will avoid the scrutiny it deserves, is shameful.\u201d\nLaurence Tubiana,the chief executive of the European Climate Foundation and the French architect of the Paris agreement, called Japan\u2019s move disappointing and contrasted it with those of economic rivals the EU, UK, China and South Korea, which she said were moving to a low-carbon economy.\n\u201cAt one of the most challenging times of recent memory, we need bolder, mutually reinforcing plans that protect our societies from the global risks we all face,\u201d Tubiana said.\nEnvironmental regulations and climate commitments have come under attack in the context of the coronavirus crisis. Under Donald Trump\u2019s administration in the US, the Environmental Protection Agency has rolled back key regulations including car efficiency standards. In the EU, carmakers wrote to the European commission last week to demand a loosening of requirements on them to cut carbon.\nThere is still scope for Japan to revise its targets. Other countries have yet to submit their detailed NDCs, but several \u2013 including the UK and the EU, and more than 70 smaller economies \u2013 made public their intention to reach net zero carbon by 2050, at last year\u2019s UN climate talks in Madrid.\nThis year\u2019s talks, called Cop 26, are still officially scheduled to be held in Glasgow this November, although there has been pressure from some quarters to announce a postponement.\nMany notable figures, including the leading climate economist Lord Stern, and former UN climate chief Christiana Figueres, have spoken out against postponement at this stage. They fear a delay would mean countries slowing their work on emissions cuts.\nUnder the plans that national governments submitted to the UN under the Paris agreement, the world would reach more than 3C of warming according to estimates \u2013 a figure scientists say would be disastrous in terms of increases in extreme weather, droughts, floods, heatwaves and sea level rises.\nNew plans are urgently needed, campaigners say, as emissions have risen globally by 4% since the Paris agreement was signed.",

        "content": "The fallout from coronavirus could help undermine Reagan-era principles and renew a sense of national interdependence\nDoes the huge surge in US unemployment claims announced on Thursday mean that we are doomed to endure the 30% unemployment of which the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis has warned?\nThe answer is no. How high unemployment rises will depend on how quickly we ramp up testing and the provision of protective equipment, enabling us to determine when and where it is safe to return to work.\nBut early evidence on the ability of countries like the US and UK to roll out tests and protective gear is not heartening. It\u2019s not too early, therefore, to start worrying about how sky-high unemployment will affect our economies and societies.\nIn one scenario, the crisis will foster support for strong leaders who can issue strict directives and enforce them by any means necessary. We have seen how China, under President Xi Jinping, was able to lock down Wuhan, limit mobility and contain the coronavirus (for now). We have also seen how the crisis encourages identity politics \u2013 how President Trump uses it to justify his xenophobic tendencies. We have seen how the crisis breeds nationalism, as countries close their borders and prohibit exports of medical equipment, and as international groupings like the G20 blow hot air.\nThese same reactive instincts were evident in the 1930s, the last time unemployment approached 30%. The role of unemployment in the rise of authoritarian figures like Hitler is disputed, but the most recent research suggests a link. There was economic nationalism, in the form of trade wars, and the political nationalism of the American aviator and aspiring presidential candidate Charles Lindbergh, now conveniently visible on the small screen. There was Oswald Mosley\u2019s antisemitism. There was the harassment and deportation of Mexican Americans, including even hospital patients, by the Los Angeles welfare department and US Department of Labor.\nBut there is also a more hopeful scenario. Authoritarian leaders don\u2019t like bad news, which they tend to suppress, sometimes at cost to themselves. One hears about rumblings of a backlash against Xi and his minions for having clamped down on news of the virus, thereby putting China at risk. Trump may similarly end up paying a price for having suppressed warnings from his own Department of Health and Human Services. If ever there was a circumstance suited to rehabilitate experts and encourage respect for politicians who defer to them, this is it.\nIn the extreme, one can imagine the crisis pounding the last nails into the coffin of the Thatcher-Reagan revolution. The idea that government should divest itself of its equity stake in essential infrastructure has already been abandoned, in Britain in the case of the railways and in the US, prospectively, the airlines. Old shibboleths about the need for budget balance and austerity have gone by the board. We are experiencing the most vivid possible reminder that the private sector, charitable bodies and local government alone can\u2019t be relied on for essential services. They can\u2019t even be relied on for an adequate supply of testing swabs, the Trump White House, no less, having organized a military airlift of these last week.\nThese are the same realizations, it can be argued, that gave rise to the New Deal in the 1930s and the Beveridge Report in 1942, which created a very different social, economic and political order than existed before.\nThe transformation may not be as dramatic this time. Even if unemployment rises to Depression levels, it can come back down quickly with medical mitigation and support from fiscal and monetary policies. The latter have been primed much more rapidly than in the 1930s. Measures to prevent bankruptcies and bank failures are being rolled out faster. Basic support for households is being provided through direct payments to taxpayers, expanded unemployment benefits, and grants to employers who avoid layoffs. All this might be thought to diminish the likelihood of a radical social and political realignment.\nBut it was not just high unemployment that led to the welfare state, the mixed economy and more expansive government. In addition, it was the second world war and the realization that national security, even national survival, required shared sacrifice, and that public support for those who sacrificed was a necessary and appropriate quid pro quo. The Beveridge Report that created the British welfare state was a product of not just the 1930s but also of the second world war. The GI bill that expanded opportunities for education and homeownership for Americans was similarly a legacy of the war. Ultimately, it was national security that begat social security.\nBoris Johnson has vowed that \u201cwe must act like a wartime government\u201d. Donald Trump insists that he is a wartime president. If fighting the virus is indeed a battle tantamount to war, then the legacies of these politicians and the attitudes and values of their successors may turn out rather differently than they currently expect.\nBarry Eichengreen is the George C Pardee and Helen N Pardee professor of economics and professor of political science at the University of California, Berkeley",

I wanted to know what I didn\u2019t know about movies in 1940. I wanted an adventure. I feel alive when I\u2019m discovering something new.\nMy first try was Son of Ingagi, a schlocky African American horror flick about a woman who keeps an ape-man in her basement. It is inept and visually flat, and I got a kick out of it as a predecessor of blaxploitation.\nNext was a Russian family film, Vasilisa the Beautiful, which starts bucolic then spirals off into the magic realms of a gnarly forest, backward walking cows, a rat man and a massive three headed dragon.

The fourth was even more of a discovery, a beautiful film about a little girl who gets lost in Moscow. Streets ahead of the Shirley Temple films of the same period, it was directed by one of the first female film-makers, Tatyana Lukashevich, and ends with the line: \u201cMama, let\u2019s get lost together tomorrow.\u201d Wow.\nNext up for me is the Austrian musical Operetta, directed by Willi Forst.

I feel I\u2019m travelling the world from my sofa, just as I did as a boy when the movie magic casement first opened up to me on TV.\nIf these discoveries continue, if my picture of 1940 builds, then I think I know what tattoo I\u2019ll get when the crisis ends: \u201c40.\u201d",

The standards required are those which will provide for essential needs, good health, satisfactory standards of child development, social cohesion and human dignity. To date, all governments stumble about in the dark. They even set levels of minimum incomes without the advice of a dietitian or nutritionist.\nAs a consequence, poor women have low birthweight babies with high morbidity and mortality rates throughout life. Semi-skilled and unskilled workers die, on average, five years younger. The poor experience double the rate of divorce and a higher rate of suicide among young people. Children who grow up in low-income families are more likely to leave school early after a lower attendance and achievement record and to have more contact with the police.\nPoverty-related crime, ill health and other expensive consequences of poverty may cost the treasury more than ensuring people have adequate incomes. Lord Morris of Manchester\u2019s amendment to the welfare reform and pensions bill this week will address these issues.Paul NicolsonZacchaeus 2000 Trust\nNick Davies concludes \u201cthere is almost no connection between reality and the easy consensus of distant journalists and politicians\u201d when comparing Roedean and Stanley Deacon schools. This political malaise affects education, health and crime. We help people prepare their means statements for the magistrates. The reality is that poverty is so bad that decent people are propelled into crime, die young, give birth to underweight children, fall ill through stress and inadequate diet, despair of clothing their children adequately for school and have unmanageable debts.\nThe easy consensus fails to take the government to task for grossly underestimating the depth of poverty which has built up. The hole in the middle of the polo mint policies of the \u201cthird way\u201d awaits a diagnosis which admits to the reality, expense and social dangers of the extreme poverty of millions of adults in and out of work in Britain.Rev Paul NicolsonZacchaeus 2000 Trust\nIt is not sufficient for governments to formulate health policy on the grounds that the average life expectancy of men and women has increased dramatically since 1901. In 1972 low-paid men could expect to die aged 66.5 and professional men 5.5 years later. By 1999 low paid men could expect to die aged 71 and the gap had increased to 7.4 years. By 1999 low paid women could expect to live to 77.1 while their professional colleagues could enjoy another 5.7 years.\nThis punitive inequality in death is a measure of social injustice that should spur all political parties to tackle the poverty that lies behind it. Giving free TV licences to the 70% of professional workers who will live to 75 years old when 54% of low-paid workers will not is no part of a relevant policy.Rev Paul Nicolson\n Chairman, Zacchaeus 2000 Trust\nCall centres and IT are being developed for the administrative convenience of government, but are leaving the poor and the vulnerable behind.\nIt is not generally understood in Whitehall that the preferred means of communication of the poorest is now the pay-as-you-go mobile. Once it is paid for, at between \u00a339 and \u00a359, there is no further charge. But a minimum \u00a35 top-up card must be bought to make outgoing calls, none of which is free. 0800 and 0870 calls can cost 10p a minute. Meanwhile, BT has cut off over 1 million landline subscribers and is removing phone boxes.\nI was recently at the magistrates court in High Wycombe. A young man had no money to pay a fine. He had not signed on for jobseeker\u2019s allowance (JSA). To do that, he had to phone a call centre in Reading, deal with the Jobcentre in High Wycombe and, in the event of a delay in payment, phone the processing centre in Milton Keynes.\nI phoned the Reading call centre on my mobile to get him started. It took me an expensive 18 minutes to get through and a further five to complete the matter in hand. They were short-staffed in all three centres and it was taking over six weeks to process the benefit applications.\nLeaving young men on the streets with no money for weeks is dangerous - particularly so when they have just been released from prison. The Jobcentre\u2019s answer was to offer a social fund loan to pay the fine, but repayment would have been deducted from a truly inadequate JSA of \u00a343.25 at \u00a310 a week. The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine estimates that the bare minimum for healthy living should be \u00a384 a week.\nThe High Wycombe magistrates rightly adjourned the case until it was all sorted out.Rev Paul NicolsonZaccheus 2000 Trust\nIt is necessary to qualify the accolade on the government\u2019s record of reducing child poverty (Letters, January 18). The treatment of housing costs and tax in the statistics used and the damaging effect of the home credit market on poverty incomes call into question the claim that 700,000 children have been \u201clifted out of poverty\u201d. The number of pensioners, families and working-age adults in poverty increased from 1979 to 1997, and, certainly for pensioners and families, the present government has reversed that trend (Letters, January 18). That is a significant achievement. But there has been no change or policy for working-age adults since 1997. There is a long way to go before Britain returns to lower levels of povertyRev Paul Nicolson\n Zacchaeus 2000 Trust\nDavid Brindle is right to ask questions about the social fund. (Opinion, April 13). The problem lies with the inadequacy of unemployment benefits that force households to borrow.\nIn Wycombe magistrates court, where we attend every week to help people who cannot pay their fines prepare their means statements, three young men came in who had no money. It was going to take weeks to process their benefit applications for \u00a344.50 a week; one man faced a two-week wait for the interview at the jobcentre that would decide if he was eligible.\nMeanwhile the jobcentre offered a crisis loan of \u00a360 from the social fund. When the benefit is ultimately paid, the repayments of the loan will be deducted at source at \u00a310 a week and the fine at \u00a35 a week, leaving \u00a329.50.\nBudget standards research shows that, as a national average, these men need \u00a391 a week in order to live healthily, but \u00a3125 in London and the south-east.The Rev Paul NicolsonChairman, Zacchaeus 2000 Trust\nPolly Toynbee is right to call the poverty lobby to account. We are a disparate, disorganised, competing lot that need to get our act together in order to reveal to the public the true and damaging nature of poverty in the UK. There is a powerful coalition of charities, faiths, health professionals and trades unions existing in embryo. It will need organisational drive. Then we could mount a powerful national campaign on the issues that matter most to the poorest citizens.Rev Paul NicolsonChairman, Zacchaeus 2000 Trust\nPolly Toynbee is right - very many families in steady employment with few changes of circumstances have gained from tax credits. It all falls apart for vulnerable households when a change of circumstances involves fulfilling their duty to inform HMRC about tax credits and child benefit, the local authority about housing and council tax benefits and the jobcentre about jobseeker\u2019s allowance and disability benefits. Cases are entering the courts where those on the lowest incomes are expected to repay around \u00a37,000 or more in overpayments to all agencies.\nEnforcement is driven by computers that have no means of identifying the illiterate, blind, disabled, pregnant, poor, mentally or chronically ill and in some cases dead. The starting points are threats of eviction for rent arrears or prison for council tax arrears.\nAn overpayment of tax credits can lead to a downward spiral of a family\u2019s fortunes into a morass of debt.Rev Paul NicholsonChairman, Zacchaeus 2000 Trust\nWhile moves to tackle the obesity crisis are welcome, what about the link between nutrition and the mental health super crisis? The health select committee estimated in 2002 that the direct cost of obesity to the NHS was between \u00a3990m and \u00a31,225m; the direct cost of mental illness rose from \u00a3965m in 1983-84 to \u00a35bn in 2003-04. One of the causes of the rise in mental illness, it has been found by the Institute for Brain Chemistry and Human Nutrition, is poor maternal nutrition before and after conception. It substantially increases the risk of low birthweight and developmental brain disorder. The incidence of low birthweight in the UK has risen from 6.6% in 1953 to 7.6% in 2003 - the highest rate of low birthweight in Europe. The Unicef/WHO 2004 analysis has Britain at 8%, on a par with Romania, Mongolia and Kazakhstan. In some inner-city areas in the UK the incidence reaches developing nations\u2019 rates of 11% to 14%.Paul NicolsonChairman, Zacchaeus 2000 Trust\nCollette Marshall is right to emphasise the depth of poverty of the 1 million children suffering the severest income inequalities here. In societies where income differences between rich and poor are smaller not only do the levels of educational attainment among schoolchildren tend to be higher but also community life is stronger and people are much more likely to trust each other. There is less violence - including substantially lower homicide rates - health is better and life expectancy is several years longer. Prison populations are smaller, birth rates among teenagers are lower. Meanwhile, in Britain, unaffordable housing, debt, chronic overcrowding and a complex benefits system massively increase the stress of inequality in poor families.Paul NicolsonZacchaeus 2000 Trust\nAdam Smith would not only have taxed the rich (Letters, October 19), he also concerned himself with the reasonable needs of the poor. He argued that social necessities were no less important than physical necessities. \u201cBy necessaries I understand not only the commodities, which are indispensably necessary for the support of life, but whatever the custom of the country renders it indecent for creditable people, even of the lowest order, to go without\u201d. The government has refused requests to set up a Minimum Income Standards Commission.Rev Paul NicolsonChairman, Zacchaeus 2000 Trust\nIt is not valid to describe the worst poverty in the UK as relative (If Cameron can climb on my caravan, anything is possible, November 23). Until politicians of all colours face the reality of absolute poverty here in Britain, they will not create policies to combat it. For example, around 60,000 young people leave care every year at the age of 16 with no financial or family support. When, or if, weeks later, the local authority gets around to carrying out their duty to assess their needs, they receive \u00a334.60 a week until the age of 18, after rent and council tax, on which to survive independently. They are absolutely poor.\nThe Family Budget Unit estimates that the minimum income standard for childless adults is a very tight \u00a385 a week. Many migrants and UK nationals work in the black economy for much less than the national minimum wage and all statutory minimum incomes are below the government\u2019s poverty thresholds.\nTo have no money anywhere is absolute poverty. To have far too little money in an expensive developed economy also threatens survival and is also absolute poverty. There are well-established truths that the poorest citizens in the UK are more likely to be ill, to die younger and to be disadvantaged in our schools. The prisons are full of people for whom survival became the overriding consideration. The pips are squeaking in the poorest households in the UK. Talk of relative poverty should be replaced by a debate that faces these facts.Rev Paul NicolsonChairman, Zacchaeus 2000 Trust\nIt is not only the residents of private care homes (No human rights for old in private homes, June 20) who are left without the protection of the human rights legislation after the decision of the House of Lords. The same anomaly exists whenever private companies undertake work that is paid for and is identical to that undertaken by public bodies. Public bodies can be challenged in law but private companies cannot. For example, some bailiffs are employed by local authorities to enforce council tax while others are employed by private companies doing identical work. The former can be challenged about irrational decisions against vulnerable debtors but, it seems, not the private companies.Paul NicolsonZacchaeus 2000 Trust\nThe government\u2019s housing policy fails to grasp the nettles of lending and land reform at the heart of the housing crisis (Everyone is entitled to a stake in the nation\u2019s soil and bricks, July 24). Doing as little as possible in order to avoid losing the votes of houseowners, or to win the votes of those who cannot get on to the housing ladder, is not a housing policy.\nThe rising value of land will continue to lead to ever-expanding inequalities in wealth as long as politicians treat it like a market with unlimited supply. The richer the wealthy become, the more they compete for the limited supply of land, squeezing poorer households with ever higher rents and the middle-class taxpayer with ever higher housing benefit, likely to exceed \u00a320bn next year.\nThe taxation of land is back to front. It is taxed with business rates and council tax when in use but never when it lies idle. An annual land-value tax on all land, replacing the deeply regressive council tax, would discourage speculators from leaving property idle while waiting to sell and take the capital gain.\nIncreasing the supply of housing will not catch up with demand or reduce prices for decades, if ever; so the regulation of lending to prevent banks flooding with money a market in short supply should be reintroduced.\nFinally, such schemes as community land trusts and limited liability partnerships, which remove land from the market in perpetuity, enabling rent and purchase at affordable prices, should be given maximum support by government.Paul NicolsonChairman, Zacchaeus 2000 Trust\n\n All is not as well in Britain as Sigmund Sternberg (Letters, August 30) would have us believe. All of us do not benefit from the way the free market is run by entrepreneurs, who undertake the vital task of managing the creation of wealth.\nAn independent inquiry into inequalities in health reported in 1999 that average incomes in the UK grew in real terms by about 40% between 1979 and 1994-95, but this growth was far greater (60-68%) among the richest 10th of the population. For the poorest 10th, average income increased by only 10% (before housing costs) or fell by 8% (after them).\nThe Institute for Public Policy Research has estimated that the value of personally owned housing has risen from \u00a336bn to \u00a31,525bn in the past 30 years; but the number of people with no assets at all has doubled over the last 20 years from 5% to 10%. Economic inequality continues to increase; it is damaging social cohesion.\nNeither Sternberg\u2019s rose-tinted spectacles nor the spray-gun approach to condemning the free market, capitalism and City bonuses will create a nation at ease with itself; but much will depend on Sternberg and his colleagues opening their eyes to the poverty they create, alongside the wealth and to reverse the trend. We seek justice, not charity.Rev Paul NicolsonChairman, Zacchaeus 2000 Trust\nProsecuting men for buying sex will deprive too many men and women of an income they would not choose to earn but for their extreme poverty. Will the government ensure that the poorest of them, who are paid for sex, have sufficient benefits, tax credits or minimum wage to ensure that prostitution is not a necessary survival strategy?Rev Paul NicolsonChairman, Zacchaeus 2000 Trust\nPolly Toynbee asks why nothing has been done about subprime lenders like Provident, who charge lone mothers receiving unemployment benefits \u00a3700 on a \u00a31,000 loan. We can tell her. Debt on our Doorstep and ourselves gave evidence to the Competition Commission\u2019s enquiry into home credit and lobbied MPs and peers during the passage of the consumer credit bill calling for a cap on interest rates.\nWe were opposed by academics, the National Consumer Council and the National Association of Citizens\u2019 Advice Bureaux, which all bought Provident\u2019s gigantic bluff that if there were a cap on interest, it would go out of business, leaving the home credit market to loan sharks. None of our opponents worked out the level of interest at which Provident could comfortably stay in business.\nThis trust is currently supporting an unemployed lone mother who was given her first TV, but did not buy a licence for three weeks. She was fined \u00a3270. In a panic she borrowed \u00a3270 with \u00a3150 interest from Provident and paid the fine in cash. But she then faced a claim for bailiff and court costs. They all ignored national standards for enforcement agents covering vulnerable situations, which requires such a case to be returned to court, where the magistrates can remit all or part of the fine. This is what happened when a colleague overheard the distressed woman telling her story in a cafe and referred her to us. The government fails to coordinate the jaws of state; it sinks its teeth into the lowest incomes, while avoiding any limit on eating up poverty incomes.Rev Paul NicolsonChairman, Zacchaeus 2000 Trust\nThere is a strong desire in parliament and among NGOs and some employers to end poverty in the UK; but there are as many policies for doing it as there are government departments and NGO campaigns. The Family Budget Unit and The Centre for Social Policy Research have now provided a focus on the weekly cost of minimum needs for a healthy life and essential participation in the community, in their publication of minimum income standards yesterday.\nThe economy cannot afford to leave statutory minimum incomes so low that costly poverty-related ill health and educational underachievement flood into excellent hospitals and schools, and crime into the courts and prisons; nor to leave those inadequate incomes to reach their beneficiaries through the stressful maze of four statutory agencies.\nThe chaotic housing market adds to the stress of poverty in the UK, with futile attempts to reform the housing benefit system, all of which make poverty worse. The absence of housing supply and the deregulation of lending have combined to lift the cost of housing benefit from \u00a35.4bn in 1988 to \u00a320bn now.\nThe scandal of state-imposed welfare poverty makes people ill and stops their children getting a decent education. It is in the taxpayer\u2019s interest to end poverty with adequate incomes and save billions.Rev Paul NicolsonChairman, Zacchaeus 2000 Trust\nWhitehall has introduced bureaucratic solutions to fuel poverty by making the vulnerable and impoverished apply for social tariffs and insulation (Lofty ideals, September 12). A minister on TV was telling people to make a phone call, apparently not knowing that BT has cut off 1m land lines, and pay-as-you-go mobile phones quickly run out of credit hanging on to \u201cfree-phone\u201d calls at 50p a minute. The winter fuel payment is paid direct into pensioners\u2019 accounts, but 1.8 million are not so lucky because they have not applied for pension credit because it is too intimidating, humiliating and fault prone for many of them.\nWithout a direct and uncomplicated injection of cash through the benefit system it is certain that the utility companies will attend the magistrates\u2019 courts with sheaves of applications to break into the homes of impoverished customers who cannot pay their bills to install pay as you go meters, charging the customer both the court costs, and more for fuel than those who pay by direct debit. Come the winter some people in perfectly insulated houses will not have the money to feed the meters or themselves.Rev Paul NicolsonChairman, Zacchaeus 2000 Trust\nPolly Toynbee is right to highlight the inadequacy of the unemployment benefit for single adults of \u00a360.50 a week (The prospect of another lost generation is a chilling one, 20 December); it is half the government\u2019s poverty threshold and 42% of the minimum income needed for healthy living as established by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. It will increase to just \u00a364.30 in April 2009.\nEconomists and civil servants have always advised politicians about the moral hazard that people will not go to work if their unemployment benefit is too high, but forget the moral hazard when it is below the minimum needed for healthy survival, which is a powerful motivator pushing decent people over the top into immoral and illegal behaviour. That is the danger of fining the unemployed for a failure to engage with the authorities about work or training; benefits are already far too low in this very expensive economy. There is no justice in the government preaching about rights and responsibilities to its poorest citizens when it has not accepted the responsibility to provide adequate minimum incomes in work or unemployment. The minimum wage is a poverty wage in London and many other areas.Rev Paul NicolsonChairman, Zacchaeus 2000 Trust\nThe Bishop of Durham is not as wrong in claiming the poor have got poorer under New Labour, who have called a halt to the rise in the numbers of pensioners and children in poverty under the Conservatives, but failed the very poor.\nA report by Save the Children in 2005 found that there has been little or no improvement in the proportion of children living in severe poverty since 1997. The Centre Forum calculated the number of people with incomes below 40% of the median income, rather than the government\u2019s poverty threshold of 60%, and found that it had increased by 250,000 between 1994-05 and 2003-04. On the governments measure, the number of childless adults in poverty increased by 500,000 between 1996-97 and 2005-06. Since 2004 the number of children and adults below the government\u2019s poverty threshold has started to increase and this year the rising prices of food, utilities and transport have hit the 2.5 million pensioners and 3.9 million children below the threshold.Rev Paul NicolsonChairman, Zacchaeus 2000 Trust\nPolly Toynbee tells of the incredulity of the newly unemployed when they find their benefit is a workhouse rate of \u00a360.50 a week. Incredulity is multiplied by the reply of the government to a debate about increasing it initiated by Julie Jones MP in the third reading of the welfare reform bill. She was told that would fundamentally undermine what the benefits system and the welfare state are there for.\nThe government should re-read the 1942 Beveridge report, which recommended that the benefit scheme should embody principles including unification of administrative responsibility, now shattered into many agencies; and adequacy, totally ignored by all British governments; and added that the aim of the plan for social security is to make want under any circumstances unnecessary.Rev Paul NicolsonChairman, Zacchaeus 2000 Trust\nThe 7.5 million adults of working age living in poverty in the UK, an increase of 800,000 since 1998, are often left out of press comment on government statistics. Many are receiving poverty incomes while unemployed, which are due to be sanctioned should they not seek work. John Mason MP, supported by Paul Rowen MP, tabled amendments to the welfare reform bill designed to ensure sanctions do not leave claimants with an income too low to sustain healthy living and are not applied in ignorance of a claimant\u2019s means.\nThe government replied the amendments missed the basic point because there is a contract between the applicant and the state and, if one obeys the rules, no sanctions will be applied. However, rights and responsibilities apply both ways. Since 1948, successive British governments have been signed up to the right to an adequate standard of living as detailed in the UN\u2019s convention on human rights, but have not honoured their side of the contract by implementing that right in adequate unemployment incomes. We hope peers debating the bill will understand that reducing with sanctions \u00a350.95 a week adult unemployment benefit for 18-25-year-olds, or \u00a364.30 thereafter, which is less than half the poverty threshold, can never be justified by a shallow appeal to an unjust social contract.Rev Paul NicolsonChairman, Zacchaeus 2000 Trust\nThe tragedy is (Jenni Russell, 21 May) that ministers for decades have swallowed hook, line and bath plug the message of their advisers that an unemployment income below subsistence level at \u00a364.30 a week is needed to force the idle into work. European countries pay 53% to 69% of average earnings to a jobless adult, quite low enough to encourage willing human beings to seek employment, while Britain pays 40%. The welfare reform bill will reduce that \u00a364.30 paid to lone mothers if they do not seek work or engage in work-related activity.Rev Paul NicolsonChairman, Zacchaeus 2000 Trust\nThe welfare reform bill ignores one essential principle, which should inform all of the many regulations about job-seeking conditions, work-related activities etc. Lord Northbourne\u2019s amendment, supported in the debate by the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives, but not by the government, requires due consideration to be given to the wellbeing of any child whose life might be affected by the decisions of officials implementing such regulations.\nThe government\u2019s good intentions are marred by an overemphasis on the benefit to a family of parents moving out of unemployment into work. Children become official barriers to work rather than the overriding responsibility of parents. Work is beneficial if it is adequately paid and the children are not harmed because the parental bond is strained or broken when they are put into childcare at crucial stages of their educational and emotional development.\nThe bill has the balance of power wrong at the point where officialdom touches family life. The social security advisory committee questioned the government\u2019s primary analysis that people are unwilling to work and unlikely to work, and need to be coerced into employment. A more socially aware analysis is that parents love their children, want to do their best for them and should have their commitment empowered and encouraged.Rev Paul NicolsonChair, Zacchaeus 2000 Trust\nThe following letter is the one that established Taxpayers Against Poverty.\nMinisters at the Department of Work and Pensions repeat ad nauseam their mantra: \u201cIt is not fair for taxpayers to be asked to pay for the cost of spare bedrooms, or housing benefit which is high in central London because rents are high etc, etc.\u201d Therefore the poorest citizens are thrust into unmanageable debt by caps and cuts in housing benefit, possible eviction, forced migration, undue stress and misery. As a citizen who pays income and council tax, VAT and the excise duty on my evening glass of wine, I steam with indignation each time I am used by ministers to justify such draconian measures making people poorer.\nI am glad my taxation is used to enable my fellow citizens, both in and out of work, to buy enough food, clothes, fuel, transport and other necessities, to pay council tax and the rent of secure homes, when they have no other means to do so; and bewildered by the short-sightedness of a policy which deliberately reduces the totally inadequate adult JSA of \u00a367.50 a week by creating rent arrears, with debt-related mental health problems and high extra costs for a hard-pressed NHS.\nThe self-evident unfairness is the current policy of dumping national debt and deficit reduction on the incomes of the squeezed middle and poorest citizens, while the higher-paid taxpayers experience no financial inconvenience. Meanwhile the OECD reports that $11.5 trillion, including bonuses, is parked in overseas accounts and the Treasury is aware that \u00a3100bn of property in central London alone is registered overseas \u2013 both out of reach of the taxman. That really is unfair. I hope thousands will join Taxpayers Against Poverty, TAP, to say so loud and clear. All we need is an email.Rev Paul NicolsontaxpayersagainstpovertyTAP@gmail.com\nSince 1979 an ideological free market approach to land has been forcing the UK back to the middle ages\n It is an immense relief to read that the housing debate has at last embraced the free market in land that is at the root of so many of the UK\u2019s troubles. The Haringey housing battle was about the people\u2019s opposition to the powerful state and a powerful private developer joining forces to remove the land from under the homes of council tenants. Since 1979 an ideological free market approach to land has been forcing the UK back to the middle ages.\nIn the history of the parish of Fingest, which I served, is the story of Henry Burgersh. He was the grandson of a baron who became bishop of Lincoln; he claimed authority over the abbot of St Albans Abbey. In March 1130 the abbot made over to the bishop the manor of Fingest (Buckinghamshire) in return for a renunciation of all episcopal rights over the monastery. The bishop promptly enclosed 300 acres of common land on which 60 families depended for survival; it is recorded that they starved. The modern version is in the unlimited, unearned, untaxed increase in the value of land grabbed for private gain to the detriment of the common good.Rev Paul NicolsonTaxpayers Against Poverty\nThe following letter is the final one by #RevPaul that was published by the Guardian\nSuzanne Moore got everything else right about the housing crisis but left out land (I\u2019m on the housing ladder but I can\u2019t cheer the rising prices, Journal, 22 February). Throughout the UK, truly affordable council housing was built on public land. The price of borrowing to build and maintain council estates and their communities was recovered over, say, 50 years by low earners paying low rents, which did not include the ever-increasing value of land. Councils are now using the high value of public land to finance developers to demolish council estates and build private housing, which council tenants cannot afford. Hence the 79% increase in homeless families in England to 86,000, including 127,000 children since 2010, some for up to and over 10 years, 1.1 million households on council waiting lists and 4,700 single adults sleeping rough each night.\nThe New Economics Foundation recently reported that the government sold enough public land for developers to build 131,000 homes, but only 2.6% will be for social rent. There is an urgent need for legislation that forbids the sale of public land and requires it to be used for affordable social housing.Rev Paul NicolsonTaxpayers Against Poverty",

Over the weekend of 21-22 March transaction volumes fell back to levels seen before the crisis.\u201d\nSymptoms are defined by the NHS as either:\nNHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should\u00a0stay at home for at least 7 days.\nIf you live with other people,\u00a0they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.\nAfter 14 days, anyone you live with who does not have symptoms can return to their normal routine. But, if anyone in your home gets symptoms, they should stay at home for 7 days from the day their symptoms start.\u00a0Even if it means they're at home for longer than 14 days.\nIf you live with someone who is 70 or over, has a long-term condition, is pregnant or has a weakened immune system, try to find somewhere else for them to stay for 14 days.\nIf you have to stay at home together, try to keep away from each other as much as possible.\nAfter 7 days, if you no longer have a high temperature you can return to your normal routine.\nIf you still have a high temperature, stay at home until your temperature returns to normal.\nIf you still have a cough after 7 days, but your temperature is normal, you do not need to continue staying at home. A cough can last for several weeks after the infection has gone.\nStaying at home means you should:\nYou can use your garden, if you have one. You can also leave the house to exercise \u2013 but stay at least 2 metres away from other people.\nIf you have symptoms of coronavirus, use the\u00a0NHS 111 coronavirus service\u00a0to find out what to do.\nSource:\u00a0NHS England\u00a0on 23 March 2020\nThe bank\u2019s data also shows how rapidly the country has shifted to online shopping. It said that on Tuesday 24 March online shopping outstripped all other forms of spending for the first time.\n\u201cOnline purchases made by Starling customers, which usually amount to less than a third of the total number of transactions each day, had already reached 40.4% on the eve of the government lockdown, before hitting 51.5% the day after on 24 March.\u201d\nThe bank also noted how the UK went into voluntary lockdown thebefore government measures were implemented. It said sales in pubs and restaurants were already down by 40% in the week before most were closed.\n\u201cThese are early days, but it\u2019s clear that people\u2019s spending behaviour is already changing quite dramatically,\u201d a spokesperson for the bank said. \u201cThe sharp rise in online shopping suggests that people are listening to the government and staying indoors.\u201d",

        "content": "In the first of her weekly columns, Heather Chaney describes preparing for a course of chemo and radiotherapy that will compromise her immune system\nIt\u2019s been almost 24 hours since my surgery, and the sedation has finally worn off. I\u2019m feeling sore, and I can\u2019t seem to shake the feeling that there\u2019s a stick running up the side of my neck. But I\u2019ve heard that fades in a couple days.\nI\u2019m sitting in my backyard in Bellevue, Washington, soaking up the rare bit of Pacific north-west sunshine. I\u2019m thinking about taking my 15-year-old son and 20-year-old daughter to the game store tonight, to pick up a copy of Animal Crossing. It\u2019s a no-contact pickup, so we\u2019ll be observing the distancing rules, but at least driving in the car will give us a little break from the house.\nWe\u2019ve all been homebound for the past week, except for the occasional walk and doctor\u2019s appointment. I know people in my community are still shopping at the grocery store and until recently kids had been playing together outside. But with my cancer, my son\u2019s asthma and my husband\u2019s artificial heart valve, we\u2019re being very careful.\nWhen I stepped through the doors of Overlake hospital in Bellevue to have the surgery, I knew instantly that this visit would be very different from the previous ones.\nI have become a fairly regular visitor recently. The first sign that something was wrong with me came suddenly, when I was rushed to the emergency room for bad vaginal bleeding and given three blood transfusions.\nA week later, I was diagnosed with stage 2 cervical cancer on 26 February. I was terrified. I felt all sorts of waves of, am I going to die? Are my two kids now going to be left with a lifetime of depression and questions about why their mom isn\u2019t there for them?\nIt was days before the first person died from coronavirus in the US, just a few miles away from me in Kirkland. The virus was on my radar, but no one was really thinking about it locally yet. In just a few weeks, it has overwhelmed the state.\nI know this diagnosis would be difficult under any circumstances. I\u2019m 49, and still have so many plans. But now, there is also this virus that can be deadly for people who are immunocompromised, like I will be soon.\nBetween new regulations about social distancing and announcements about closures, day-to-day life seems to be changing from moment to moment. Sometimes it feels like there\u2019s a cruel race being run to see what will kill me first \u2013 cancer, coronavirus or stress.\nWhen I was in hospital for this latest visit, the scene outside the elevator was now strangely unfamiliar. A security guard was waiting as the doors opened. Hospital staff quizzed me and my husband, Eric, about where we had travelled recently and our coughing history. They took our temperatures. We were given badges detailing exactly which parts of the hospital we were allowed to walk through, before being sent to another screening point.\nI\u2019ve been reading all about the rising coronavirus case numbers in Washington. But suddenly it felt so real. As I sat with an intake staff member, the scene around me seemed to slow. I nervously scanned the room for anyone coughing or wearing a mask. Questions shot into my head: have I touched anything? Did I use hand sanitizer when I walked through the second checkpoint?\nI had come to get my chemotherapy port put in, the first big step on my nine-week cancer treatment journey. Medication can be delivered into the port rather than into a vein, which means fewer needles. After this, I\u2019ve been told to expect weeks of near-daily radiation and once-a-week intravenous chemo, followed by brachytherapy, a type of internal radiation.\nInside a small room with a bed and glass doors covered in curtains, I changed into a gown and settled in for my six-hour stay for the surgery. Nurses streamed in and out. They were attentive and compassionate, but I could sense something frantic happening in the halls.\nI met with my doctor and talked with an anesthesiologist, who expressed surely what others were thinking: what a terrible time to have to have cancer.\nThey led me back to the operating room, where they took an X-ray to find the right place for the port. I was sedated for about an hour and by the time I woke up, the device had been safely inserted on the right side of my chest, just under my clavicle. I was offered food and told to take Tylenol if I felt uncomfortable at home. But my husband wasn\u2019t there.\nWe\u2019ve been married for 22 years, and, although he doesn\u2019t get to be the caretaker much, he\u2019s really good at it. I wanted him at my bed, reassuring me as I woke up that it was all finished and everything had gone well.\nI learned later that when he\u2019d returned to the hospital, security hadn\u2019t let him past the main doors, but no one would tell him why.\nI\u2019m worried about how my kids are handling all of this isolation while also facing my diagnosis. My son is out of school and can\u2019t see his friends in person. My daughter has autism and Marfan syndrome, and I\u2019ve always been the one she can rely on. She won\u2019t let anyone else do her hair.\nI\u2019m not sleeping much these days. I just can\u2019t seem to get all of this out of my head. My doctor told me that if I have a fever of 100.5 or higher, they won\u2019t be able to continue with treatment. And if I get coronavirus, that could mean weeks without radiation or chemo.\nIf we pause treatment, who knows how the cancer will have progressed by then or even what the healthcare system in this state or country will look like at that point. I\u2019ve heard from close friends who are nurses about a shortage of gloves and masks. Will there be enough protective equipment for my treatments to carry on?\nMy doctor tells me by week two or three of chemo and radiation, I\u2019m going to be immunocompromised, so I\u2019ve prepared for not being able to leave the house except for hospital appointments. My husband is working from home. I filled everyone\u2019s prescriptions and stocked up on food I know my kids will eat.\nLuckily, my years-long love of hotel and airline amenities has finally paid off. I have a giant bag of little hand sanitizers and soaps, so I didn\u2019t have to go out for any of that. My daughter is transgender and I have to wear surgical gloves when I give her hormone therapy, so I ordered some extra from Amazon.\nIt\u2019s scary staring out at a future filled with unknowns. But at least there\u2019s one thing I know for sure. I\u2019m as prepared as I can be.\nHeather Chaney, 49, is a stay-at-home mom from Bellevue, Washington.

        "content": "And in Wales, senior nurse says some healthcare workers are writing letters in case they die\nAn acute shortage of protective equipment for healthcare workers dealing with the Covid-19 outbreak in Northern Ireland has been revealed in a leaked document that shows suppliers are warning some gear cannot be delivered until the summer.\nInternal stock checks issued on Wednesday by the region\u2019s health service listed item after item of personal protective equipment (PPE) as \u201cout of stock\u201d, including respirator masks, eye protection and basic hygiene products.\nOf the 33 Covid-19 \u201caffected products\u201d listed on the leaked Northern Ireland document, 32 items were marked \u201cout of stock\u201d, with one kind of protective clothing marked \u201ccritically low in stock\u201d. The documents suggest officials have released alternative products in response to the shortages from emergency stockpiles.\nThe leak comes as authorities in both Wales and Scotland also scramble to release PPE from emergency stockpiles and announced measures to distribute supplies to frontline NHS and social care staff.\nLibby Nolan, a senior nurse currently assigned to an intensive treatment unit (ITU) in south Wales, told the Guardian that some healthcare workers have begun preparing letters to be used in case they die, putting into writing how they were told to work without adequate PPE. She said they were \u201cthinking ahead for insurance and litigation purposes\u201d to ensure their families receive sufficient compensation.\nShe said PPE shortages remained at the end of last week, including goggles and FFP3 respirator masks, affecting staff safety, adding: \u201cYou just wouldn\u2019t send firemen into a burning fire without apparatus, would you?\u201d\nOn Friday, the British Medical Council in Wales said that while the Welsh government has advised there were sufficient PPE stocks, the reality was that \u201cdoctors on the frontline are experiencing shortages and many are extremely anxious over the adequacy of the equipment\u201d.\nThe Northern Ireland document leaked to the Guardian, titled \u201cCovid-19 product shortages\u201d, suggests commercial suppliers are struggling to meet the rise in demand for PPE as the NHS in Northern Ireland, known as Health and Social Care (HSC), responds to rising numbers of Covid-19 patients.\nAccording to the document, one supplier is unable to provide certain kinds of visors and face masks \u201cuntil July 2020\u201d, while the major industrial supplies conglomerate 3M \u201ccannot give [HSC] any certainty over future supply\u201d of a particular line of FFP3 respirator mask.\nOther 3M respirator masks are described as becoming \u201cavailable soon\u201d or \u201cavailable from April 2020\u201d. The stock checks show antibacterial wipes were also listed as out of stock.\nDetails of the shortages are likely to renew concerns about PPE supplies raised by healthcare workers, professional bodies and hospital chiefs across the UK in recent days.\nIn Northern Ireland on Friday, Stormont\u2019s finance minister, Conor Murphy, announced a joint-deal with the Irish government for a \u201csignificant order\u201d of PPE from China.\nMurphy said: \u201cWe want to be sure that if the crisis that is coming our way becomes more severe in Britain and those supply lines across the Irish Sea dry up, then we want our own supply chain here.\u201d\nA spokesperson for the Department of Health in Northern Ireland said the document seen by the Guardian was \u201cregularly updated\u201d and only \u201cprovides a snapshot of supply arrangements in place at particular junctures.\u201d He said the document does not \u201cin any way suggest\u201d there are issues with the region\u2019s emergency stockpile, and highlighted the release last week of 30% of this pandemic stockpile.\n\u201cAt present, we have enough PPE to keep staff safe,\u201d the spokesperson said, adding the department \u201cwill continue to pursue every feasible supply route, both local and international, to enhance our supplies\u201d.\nOver the past week, PPE shortages have emerged as a major issue in the UK\u2019s response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Health authorities in England sought to reassure healthcare workers over the weekend, promising over 170m respirator masks, surgical masks and other PPE equipment to NHS services across the country.\nIn recent days the Guardian has continued to receive messages from frontline healthcare workers from around the UK expressing concern about the adequacy and availability of PPE.\nA senior doctor at a hospital in the West Midlands experiencing high numbers of Covid-19 patients said that on wards where there were suspected and confirmed coronavirus patients: \u201cwe have cleaners, healthcare assistants, nurses, and they\u2019re just using aprons that you use to serve lunches and dinners, because we\u2019ve run out of the full protective gowns.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s scarce amounts of PPE,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the FFP3 masks, we\u2019re just using surgical masks.\u201d\nShe added that colleagues were nervous about speaking out about PPE because talking to the media is frowned upon. \u201cThe only reason I\u2019m doing it is because it gets to a point where staff are coming in and putting themselves at risk and we don\u2019t have the right equipment to do the right job, so I think someone has to say something.\u201d",

        "content": "Poems, exhibitions and a comic book to mark talent of Thomas Chatterton, 250 years after death\nHe was revered by poets such as Wordsworth, Shelley and Coleridge and a romanticised painting depicting his deathbed remains an enduring image of doomed artistic talent.\nNow a series of projects marking the 250th anniversary of the death, at the age of 17, of Bristol-born Thomas Chatterton is under way to remind people of his extraordinary but often forgotten life, and, perhaps, inspire a new generation of Romantic poets.\nThe celebration includes the commissioning of new poems based on the deathbed painting of Chatterton by Henry Wallis, which hangs in Tate Britain, London. A comic book relating his life story is being produced, and a competition will be held to design a new monument to him in Bristol.\nAndrew Kelly, director of the Bristol Cultural Development Partnership, said one of the main aims of the anniversary celebrations \u2013 called A Poetic City \u2013 was simply to make sure Bristolians knew about him.\n\u201cDespite his accolade by some as the father of Romantic poetry, and the centuries of fascination that he\u2019s held for poets, artists and musicians, he\u2019s largely unknown in his home city,\u201d said Kelly.\nChatterton was born in November 1752. A solitary, precocious child, he spent many hours reading and writing near a tomb in the church of St Mary Redcliffe in Bristol.\nHe adopted the persona of an imaginary 15th century monk, Thomas Rowley, and produced work \u2013 not only poems, but maps, letters, and even fake business accounts \u2013 in Rowley\u2019s name.\nChatterton\u2019s death in August 1770 is shrouded in mystery. It has long been thought that he took his own life, but some modern academics believe it was an accident.\nKelly said: \u201cHis story raises more themes including artistic credulity and credibility, the role of the fake in art, young artists, arts and mental health, and the nature of celebrity.\u201d\nThe great Romantic poets became huge Chatterton enthusiasts. \u201cAt the time they were writing, Britain was moving towards industrialisation,\u201d said Kelly. \u201cThey liked the fact that he looked back to the medieval period, writing under the guise of Thomas Rowley.\n\u201cThey were influenced by his politics. He was very radical, against the slave trade and kicking against the establishment. There was also the doomed romanticism \u2013 his supposed suicide, though the opinion now is that it was accident rather than suicide.\u201d\nAs well as looking to the past, A Poetic City will touch on issues from Chatterton\u2019s lifetime which are still relevant today, such as young people and mental health, and fake news.\nWhile there is a statue of Chatterton in Millennium Square in Bristol, only the fragments of a monument to him that used to stand at St Mary Redcliffe church survive in a city museum. A competition is to be held to design a new monument, which will hopefully be erected within a few years.\nThe project will involve the Glenside hospital museum in Bristol, which is based in a former psychiatric hospital and tells the story of mental health care through the ages. The museum\u2019s co-ordinator, Stella Man, said she hoped it could help widen the debate about mental illness and the role art and heritage could play.\nAnother highlight will be a collection of poems by 12 contemporary writers responding to the Wallis painting. They will be compiled in a book and read in public.\nTheresa Lola, the Young People\u2019s Laureate for London, has composed one of the poems, focusing on the window behind Chatterton\u2019s deathbed and wondering why it is open.\nDanny Pandolfi, a director of the Lyra Poetry Festival, which has commissioned the work, said: \u201cChatterton is not someone who is massively talked about or celebrated. He should be.\u201d",

Local news said the four were later picked up by the police.\nGunfire was heard coming from the building into Monday evening, with ambulances taking away wounded SDF troops and inmates. Unconfirmed reports said several people had died in the violence.\nIn security camera footage broadcast by the Kurdish news agency ANF, men in orange jumpsuits in a crowded room held a banner up to the camera demanding their human rights be respected. It was not immediately clear whether the riot was linked to fears over a potential coronavirus outbreak.\nAircraft from the US-led coalition against Isis assisted in surveillance overnight and into Monday, according to the operation\u2019s military spokesperson, Col Myles Caggins III.\nThe situation remains tense, with prisoners still in control of some sections of the complex despite reinforcements in the form of an SDF counter-terrorism unit.\nIvan Hassib, a local journalist, posted a video from outside the former school complex of dozens of SDF soldiers stationed outside the perimeter and on the roof of the large facility before the lunchtime raid to quell the uprising began.\nA statement from the SDF spokesman Kino Gabriel later on Monday said no prisoners had escaped but did not clarify whether that meant missing inmates had been captured.\nThe UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitor, said its local networks reported four men had escaped. Syrian state media put the number at 12.\nWhile Kino said the situation in the detention centre was \u201ccompletely under control\u201d, the fighting appeared to be ongoing.\nThe Rojava Information Centre, a research group based in north-east Syria, said Ghourian prison held 3,000-5,000 people, many of whom were foreign nationals suspected of travelling to Syria to join the now-defunct \u201ccaliphate\u201d. Only \u201clow-level\u201d prisoners were housed at the facility, Caggins added.\nIsis lost control of its last territory in Syria a year ago after a five-year ground and air campaign by the US-led coalition. The SDF says it is still holding about 12,000 fighters in overcrowded prisons across its territory in north-east Syria, along with about 100,000 women and children in squalid detention camps.\nUp to 2,000 male prisoners are foreigners from almost 50 countries. An estimated 60 British children are still in the area.\nIn October last year, Turkey followed through on a longstanding threat to attack the Kurdish-led forces on its southern border, which Ankara views as terrorists. In the ensuing chaos, 249 women and 700 children with links to Isis walked out of a secure annex at Ain Issa camp when guards abandoned their posts after Turkish shelling.\nThe Kurdish authorities have repeatedly called on the international community to repatriate citizens, warning they do not have the resources to house Isis suspects indefinitely. Years of stonewalling from western governments, however, has led them to suggest foreign nationals could be tried in the Kurdish administration\u2019s courts.\nHuman Rights Watch and other groups say many inmates in male prisons are children or were arrested on flimsy charges, echoing similar concerns over the processing of Isis suspects over the border in Iraq.",

Taking into account rent deferrals and moves to monthly payments, which Hammerson has offered to some tenants, it has received 57% of rent due.\nTwo of Hammerson\u2019s flagship centres, Victoria in Leeds and Highcross in Leicester, are fully closed, while 30 essential stores \u2013 such as food stores and pharmacies - remain open across other malls, which account for 4% of rent.\nThe firm said it believed it should support its tenants, in particular smaller and independent brands that have been hit hard by the closure of its malls, and that it would review requests for rent deferrals, moves to monthly payments and waivers on a case-by-case basis.\nThe fashion chain Primark and the fast food chain Burger King have both said they would not be paying rent to landlords. They are among Hammerson\u2019s tenants, although the company did not specify which companies had not paid rent. The restaurant chain Carluccio\u2019s, which on Monday collapsed into administration, had written to its landlords to seek rent cuts or deferrals.\nThe Swedish fashion chain H&M, another Hammerson tenant, has asked its landlords to give it the right to exit leases with one month\u2019s notice if sales do not recover after the pandemic.\nFellow shopping centre firm Intu, which owns the Trafford Centre in Manchester and Lakeside in Essex, said last week it had received 29% of rent due. It is fighting for survival as the low rent take puts it on course to breach the terms on its debt commitments, unless its lenders show some leniency.\nHammerson, which scrapped its dividend to conserve cash, said it had access to just over \u00a31bn of borrowing facilities and cash, and would receive \u00a3395m from the sale of seven retail parks at the end of April.\nThe UK retail industry was already under pressure from weak consumer confidence, a shift to online shopping and rising costs. The trend had hit Hammerson hard and forced it to write down its property portfolio by \u00a3828m last year. It has sold its out-of-town retail parks to focus on its flagship malls.",

        "content": "From the escapism of F Scott Fitzgerald to the story of the woman who edited Vogue in the Blitz, the Guardian fashion team suggest style-focused books to distract and inspire \n\u201cIt is the present we must reckon with,\u201d observes Thomas Cromwell in the final part of Mantel\u2019s trilogy. You can say that again, mate. At 900 pages, The Mirror and the Light has arrived eerily perfectly formed for the present we are reckoning with \u2013 and I don\u2019t just mean that the hardback version is the perfect size for putting under your laptop to avoid double chin on Zoom calls. Cromwell is a master of optics and power dressing five centuries ahead of his time: he sees the visual messaging in every embroidered cloak and the symbolism in every jewellery love gift. Also, the square necklines are very this-season Rixo.Jess Cartner-Morley\nEven if you have yet to surrender to a full day in sweatpants, life probably feels less than glamorous at the moment. What better world to get lost in, then, than one described by F Scott Fitzgerald. The Great Gatsby is the obvious choice, but if you pine after a cancelled holiday to, say, the south of France, the author\u2019s last novel is a good way to get your Riviera fashion fix. From bathing suits and corsages to the notion of dressing for dinner, there is plenty of style inspiration to stockpile.Leah Harper\nIf you have ever felt sheepish about having an interest in style, I urge you to read this book. It argues that clothes are far from a trivial or superficial pursuit, through potted fashion history and reflection from luminaries such as Jane Austen and Nancy Mitford. Most memorable, though, are the stories of women in horrific circumstances who have used clothing as balm; the image of a seamstress customising her fellow prisoners\u2019 uniforms in Ravensbr\u00fcck concentration camp during the second world war has stayed with me since I read it a decade ago. The book is a great read for where we\u2019re at now \u2013 joyful, hopeful and free of judgment. It seems to say: whatever makes you feel better, whatever you enjoy when life is otherwise bewildering, you should absolutely go for it. Hannah Marriott\nLooking at the intergalactic fashions created by designer Larry LeGaspi is wonderfully escapist. Rick Owens, who curated this coffee table book after realising there was a LeGaspi-shaped hole in the internet, credits the designer as a big influence on his own otherworldly fashion aesthetic. Stage looks for Kiss, Labelle and Divine are just some of the treasures in this warm, magical scrapbook of 70s album covers, interviews, design sketches and backstage photos. Think Close Encounters of the Studio 54 kind.Priya Elan\nIf you haven\u2019t read this fashion classic, now is the time, if only for the genesis chapter of the LBD: \u201cIt was a warm evening, nearly summer, and she wore a slim cool black dress, black sandals, and a pearl choker. For all her chic thinness, she had an almost breakfast-cereal air of health, a soap and lemon cleanness, a rough pink darkening of the cheeks.\u201d The book that invented the Little Black Dress is full of sage style advice. \u201cIt\u2019s tacky to wear diamonds before you\u2019re 40, and even that\u2019s risky. They only look right on the really old girls.\u201dJess Cartner-Morley\nIf it\u2019s a complete change of mood you want, look no further than Alexa Chung\u2019s 2013 memoir-cum-picture-book. This scrapbook-style collection of the kinds of images beloved by fashion Instagram \u2013 Annie Hall, Anna Karina, Twiggy and, of course, Alexa herself \u2013 is ideal to fill the void between Zoom dates and online yoga. A pleasant, if surface-level, dip into the world of the not-yet-designer, filled with fun soundbites such as: \u201cI am obsessed with moisturising. I am also obsessed with cigarettes \u2013 so I like to think the two balance each other out.\u201d It feels surprisingly dated at times \u2013 but that\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing right now. Leah Harper\nI wanted to see Kim Kardashian dressed up as Big Ben. I hoped Katy Perry would use a sundial as a fascinator. But this year\u2019s Met Gala, which was to take place on 4 May, has been postponed. Luckily, the set text on which red carpet outfits were to be based is still ripe for enjoyment. Orlando is a funny, surreal, exuberant novel about a poet who lives from Elizabethan times until the early 20th century. It questions the very nature of time, which feels great right now. It is also brilliant on clothes as \u201ca symbol of something hid deep beneath \u2026 The man has his hand free to seize his sword, the woman must use hers to keep the satins from slipping from her shoulders.\u201d More than simply keeping us warm, Woolf argues, clothes \u201cchange our view of the world and the world\u2019s view of us\u201d, which makes me think I should raise my Google Hangouts game at some point. Hannah Marriott\nSet in the frock department of an upscale Sydney department store in 1959, this book was described as \u201ca deceptively smart comic gem\u201d by The New York Times Book Review when it was first published in 1993. Hilary Mantel has said it is \u201cthe book I most give as a gift to cheer people up\u201d. The sassy attitude and jazzy aesthetic will appeal to fans of The Marvellous Mrs Maisel, while its thoughtful comedy of manners delivers just the right degree of escapism.Jess Cartner-Morley\nIf you\u2019re after a chilling insight into modern society, look no further than Bret Easton Ellis\u2019s American Psycho. Not for the faint-hearted, this bitter black comedy depicts stomach-wrenching brutality, although its main focus is the yuppie Wall Street mentality of the sharply dressed protagonist Patrick Bateman. The narrative jumps suddenly from his thrill at purchasing a new pair of A Testoni loafers to scenes of extreme violence. Bateman is obsessed with his image; from the finest clothes, as instructed in GQ, to the wealthy friends he hates, to being seen in the hottest clubs with the most attractive \u201chardbodies\u201d he can find. It\u2019s a portrayal of dissatisfaction that arises from presenting a perfect exterior but being hollow beneath, something more apt in today\u2019s Instagram culture than ever. Not an easy read, but an engrossing one, and you will know what type of suit you can wear with cashmere socks once you are done.Peter Bevan\nAudrey Withers, wartime editor of British Vogue, earned herself the nickname Austerity Withers for her gung-ho, can-do spirit. Beginning her editorship the day the blitz began in London, she achieved no mean feat in keeping the print magazine on shelves throughout the war. Vogue, she liked to say, was put to bed in a bunker like everyone else in London. This recent biography features jolly cameos from Cecil Beaton and Elizabeth David, but it is the stories of how her Vogue adapted its lifestyle to the zeitgeist, with features on growing your own vegetables and cutting your own hair, that make it perfect for today.Jess Cartner-Morley\nWhen The Beautiful Fall came out in 2006, Karl Lagerfeld took author Alicia Drake to court for invasion of privacy. This fact should be enough to make anyone want to read the tale of Lagerfeld of fellow designer and frenemy Yves Saint Laurent from the 50s onwards. A mixture of gossip, hedonism, glamorous muses and fashion history, you will finish this with more knowledge of Parisian fashion over a key 40-year period, yes, but also an unmistakable desire to go disco dancing till the sun comes up, once quarantine is lifted.

        "content": "Promotion of Glaswegian career officer Ken McCallum announced by Priti Patel \nMI5\u2019s deputy head will take the top job at the spy agency next month promising a sharper focus on China and to work more closely with the private sector in harnessing artificial intelligence in tackling hostile state and terrorist activity.\nKen McCallum, a career MI5 officer, has been the agency\u2019s deputy director general since April 2017 and was seen by insiders as the heir apparent at an organisation that prides itself on internal appointments to its leading position.\nThe Glaswegian is the youngest ever boss of MI5, although the organisation will only say he is \u201cin his 40s\u201d \u2013 and replaces Sir Andrew Parker, who had been due to step down in April after seven years as the director general in charge of the the UK\u2019s domestic security service.\nHis appointment was announced by the home secretary, Priti Patel, on Monday.\n\u201cMI5\u2019s purpose is hugely motivating,\u201d McCallum said. \u201cOur people \u2013 with our partners \u2013 strive to keep the country safe, and they always want to go the extra mile. Having devoted my working life to that team effort, it is a huge privilege now to be asked to lead it as director general.\u201d\nInsiders said that McCallum wanted to be clearer about the threat posed by China \u2013 particularly in terms of industrial espionage and cyberwarfare \u2013 in the belief that the level of spying by Bejiing in the UK was not appreciated more widely.\nBut the agency recognises that its concerns about China, which predate the coronavirus crisis by many months, also need to be set against the fact that the vast country also remains an important economic partner for the UK.\nMI5 is expected to continue to support the decision to allow Huawei to supply 5G mobile phone equipment, even if highlighting other threats from China could provide further ammunition to Bejing\u2019s critics on the Conservative backbenches, who are threatening to try to block the Chinese company\u2019s involvement.\nMcCallum also hopes to work more closely with technology companies to try to better exploit advances in technology at a time when the agency also remains concerned about the rise of hard-to-crack end-to-end encryption.\nThe spy agency believes it no longer has the internal capability to develop what it needs in fields such as artificial intelligence and data analysis, while McCallum will continue to demand that spy agencies have lawful access to secure messaging services.\nAt one point, around a decade ago, McCallum was responsible for MI5\u2019s cyber activities, when the subject was less fashionable in intelligence circles. It was a period that helped shape his interest in China and working with the technology industry.\nAs deputy director general, McCallum was responsible for the agency\u2019s operational work during a period when there were terrorist attacks in Manchester and London, and for MI5\u2019s response to the attempted assassination of Sergei Skripal by Russia.\nMcCallum has 25 years experience within MI5, spending the first 10 years of his career working on Northern Ireland, focusing on terrorism and the development of the peace process around the time of the 1998 Good Friday agreement.\nHe was asked to take charge of counter-terror investigations and risk management relating to the London 2012 Olympics, before being promoted to become director general, strategy in 2015, responsible for MI5\u2019s relationships with its sister intelligence agencies GCHQ and MI6.\nMcCallum will become the 18th director general of MI5 since its foundation in 1909, although its leaders have only been publicly avowed since 1993. Modern agency chiefs serve fixed periods of office, preventing them from becoming entrenched at the top of the agencies they run.\nParker, 57, had his term extended despite a difficult period in 2017 when the UK was hit by a spate of terrorist attacks; after the attack at London Bridge, the agency admitted that the ringleader, Khuram Butt, had been on its radar but the signs that the Islamist terrorist was planning the attack that killed eight with two associates were missed.\nFresh concerns also emerged this winter when Usman Khan, a man convicted of terror offences and released on licence, killed two in an attack also near London Bridge, prompting an emergency tightening of terror sentencing amid concerns that people were continuing to be radicalised in prison.\nBut the military defeat of Islamic State in Syria and the death of its leader Abu-Bakr al-Baghdadi has given some cautious grounds for optimism. The terror threat was reduced from severe to substantial last November.",

        "content": "Conservative whip whom many held responsible for Margaret Thatcher\u2019s downfall\nTristan Garel-Jones, who has died aged 79, was a perceptive and astute member of the Thatcher government whips\u2019 office, with such unerring political instincts that he won admiration even from his opponents in the Labour whips\u2019 office on the other side of the members\u2019 lobby as well as among his critics on the Conservative right- wing. The widespread belief that it was he who inspired the ruthless character of Francis Urquhart in the novel and TV series House of Cards sprang from the wit and subtlety he displayed during eight years as a whip.\nBut Garel-Jones also had the ability to win affection and trust. A wealthy man of great generosity, he drew his political strength from a complete lack of personal ambition for anything other than the advancement of his friends and the political causes in which he believed. Primary among the latter was the future of the European Union and, as minister of state at the Foreign Office, he was responsible for the 1993 legislation to ratify the Maastricht treaty that stoked the Tory infighting that eventually led to the 2016 referendum on withdrawal.\nPersonal mobile phones were only just becoming available at that time and the fact that Garel-Jones owned one on which he could display the treaty legislation in its entirety in order to bolster wavering colleagues was a source of great wonder at Westminster.\nIn a speech about the UK\u2019s upcoming presidency of the European council in the second half of 1992, Garel-Jones suggested that the approach of John Major\u2019s government would be \u201ca persuasive mix of principle and pragmatism\u201d. It was an elegant phrase in which he coincidentally encapsulated his own political approach.\nAlthough he was a Tory \u201cwet\u201d \u2013 as Margaret Thatcher branded those who opposed her rigorous policies \u2013 and even voted against the government on the day of his maiden speech within weeks of first being elected in 1979, he was always loyal to his word. Thatcher knew he did not share her brand of Conservative politics, but trusted and liked him. After he became a whip in 1982 he once said, albeit with typical hyperbole, that he would \u201ckill for Thatcher\u201d.\nYet Garel-Jones was held personally responsible by many Conservative MPs for Thatcher\u2019s downfall. On the night of the first ballot of Michael Heseltine\u2019s leadership challenge in 1990 when Thatcher failed to secure enough votes for victory, Garel-Jones had organised a late night meeting after the Commons business closed at his home, an elegant Queen Anne house in Victoria.\nFive members of the cabinet were among at least a dozen ministers present at what became known as the \u201cCatherine Place conspiracy\u201d and concluded, in Garel-Jones\u2019 words, that \u201cthe game\u2019s up\u201d for Thatcher. She resigned the next day.\nThe irony was that after Sir Anthony Meyer\u2019s \u201cstalking horse\u201d leadership contest the previous year, which Garel-Jones had helped defeat, it was he, as deputy chief whip, who asked to see Thatcher and told her that she needed to drop the controversial poll tax. \u201cYou have won easily this time, but remember there are 100 assassins lurking in the bushes,\u201d he said.\nHe also wrote a briefing note for the chief whip, Tim Renton, saying: \u201cI believe that this is the beginning of the end for Mrs Thatcher\u201d and that the job of the whips was to manage that end without a party split. A further piquancy was provided by the view held in Thatcher\u2019s own office that if she had followed the advice in 1989 of the outgoing chief whip, David Waddington, and appointed Garel-Jones as his successor, he could have saved her job in 1990. \u201cI\u2019d have got the old bat in,\u201d he said himself later.\nGarel-Jones became a close friend of Major. He identified Major\u2019s potential when they were both whips and in 1988 was already thinking of him as a future party leader. However he worked for Douglas Hurd in the election that followed Thatcher\u2019s resignation, remaining loyal to a promise made to Hurd during the 1986 Westland crisis.\nHis anxiety about this difficulty was assuaged by Major himself two days before he became prime minister. He stopped his car in the rain at midnight, having spotted Garel-Jones walking home from the Commons, and told him he understood and would have done the same. On becoming prime minister, he retained Garel-Jones at the Foreign Office, where he had been appointed that summer.\nBy the following year, however, Garel-Jones had decided he wanted to leave government and told Major as much. He was persuaded to stay on to oversee Maastricht and the UK presidency in Europe and although he could have joined the cabinet as secretary of state for transport, or for his native Wales, he stood down voluntarily in 1993 and went to the House of Lords after the Labour landslide victory in 1997.\nHe was disaffected by his party\u2019s in-fighting on Europe \u2013 one of the more polite descriptions he used for eurosceptics was \u201cmaniacs\u201d \u2013 and wanted to spend more time with his family. He was a literate and cultured man who collected modern Spanish art and European literature. Less enthusiastically, he also collected all the books published by parliamentarians during his years at Westminster.\nGarel-Jones was born in Gorseinon, South Wales, one of two sons born to Meriel (nee Williams) and Bernard. His brother died in childhood. When his father was posted to India because of the second world war, the family moved to Llangennech, near Llanelli, where they lived above an uncle\u2019s newsagent shop and Tristan attended the Welsh-speaking village school.\nTristan\u2019s mother, an actor, suffered from bronchitis and in 1948 they moved to the warmer climate of Spain, where his father taught English at the school of architecture in Madrid. He later opened his own language school, La Casa Inglesa. Tristan was sent to preparatory school in Kent and then to King\u2019s School, Canterbury, where he played \u201cuseful\u201d rugby.\nHe joined his father as principal of the language school in 1960. There he met Catalina Garrigues Carnicer, one of the pupils and the daughter of a wealthy Andalucian landowner. They married in 1966 and moved to the UK with their four sons in 1970. Their daughter was born in 1981. Garel-Jones joined a merchant bank with Latin American interests and worked as a financial consultant until taking a post as aide to the Conservative party chairman, Lord (Peter) Thorneycroft, in 1978.\nHe had joined the party in 1970, standing unsuccessfully as parliamentary candidate in Caernarvon in February 1974 and Watford in the October election of the same year. He won in Watford in 1979. Arriving in the Commons he swiftly established himself as an astute political operator. He was a chain-smoking teetotaller, highly sociable and often to be found in the Commons\u2019 bars, where little escaped his attention.\nHe was a founding member of the Blue Chip dining group of social liberals among the 1979 Tory intake and was appointed as a parliamentary private secretary to Barney Hayhoe in 1981, before becoming an assistant whip the following year. He wore mono- grammed shirts and handmade shoes and used his wealth discreetly to assist those in need.\nHe was a frequent host to political friends, notably Major, at his family home at the foot of the Gredos hills, 100 miles from Madrid. He was known as \u201cthe Member for Madrid Central\u201d and once acted as official translator for Major on a prime ministerial visit to South America.\nHe was greatly amused to be invited in political retirement to become the bullfighting correspondent of the Spectator by Boris Johnson, the then editor, and used his first column to point out that there was no word in Spanish for \u201cbullfight\u201d or \u201cbullfighter\u201d. A humanist, he was a member of the National Secular Society.\nHe is survived by Catalina and their children, Julian, Inigo, Ivan, Sebastian and Victoria.\n William Armand Thomas Tristan Garel-Jones, Lord Garel-Jones, politician, born 28 February 1941; died 23 March 2020",

Red Square is empty, shopping malls are shuttered and downtown parks have been cordoned off, as Muscovites prepare to self-isolate for a month or longer.\nAnd yet, in Moscow\u2019s Sokol neighbourhood, a 15-minute drive from the Kremlin, you could almost have mistaken Monday for a normal day. Dog walkers were out early and supermarkets were open for business, even if foot traffic was a bit slow.\nBuses were running and food deliverers in lemon-yellow jackets whizzed by on bicycles. A manager said they had made several hundred deliveries and had not been stopped yet. \u201cIt\u2019s like a normal day,\u201d he said. \u201cJust a lot more orders.\u201d\nMany residents did respect the ban, which was announced on Sunday evening in a blogpost by the Moscow mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, but others found there was little stopping them from venturing out. Police are largely absent from the streets, at least for now.\nThere is a sense that the chaotic rollout of this week\u2019s lockdown will be followed by tougher enforcement, including electronic QR-codes used to track residents. In just 10 days, the capital has gone from being told the Covid-19 outbreak is under control to having a virtual curfew.\n\u201cIt\u2019s enough to make you go crazy,\u201d said Nadezhda, 48, who was seated by the front door to her apartment building, where she lives with her husband. \u201cI\u2019d barely heard of coronavirus [until this month], and now we\u2019re going to spend the next month climbing the walls at home. Nobody was prepared for this.\u201d\nMuscovites who can leave the city have fled for their countryside dachas, hoping to trade in cramped apartments for cottages and a chance to let their kids play outside. Richer Russians have reportedly sought to buy personal ventilators as they prepare at-home clinics, the Moscow Times reported last week.\nMeanwhile, activists are worried about the effect the ban could have on at-risk groups of people staying at home, such as older people and women and children in abusive relationships.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know when they\u2019re going to let everyone out again, if this could be one month, two months, more,\u201d said Alexandra Sokolova, a graphic designer who was working with local activists to bring groceries to elderly people in the area. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to know what to expect tomorrow. So we\u2019re taking this chance, when we know we can still go outside, to stock up.\u201d\nThe authorities were right to institute a tougher regime to slow the spread of coronavirus, she said. \u201cBut that should come with provisions for people who need help.\u201d\nMuscovites have been told to stay inside except to go to the shop, the pharmacy, to seek medical help, or to walk the dog \u2013 and even then need to stay within 100 metres of home. The city centre has virtually shut down as restaurants and shops have closed.\nOn Monday, police officers in medical masks patrolled the pedestrian Nikolskaya Street, which hosted raucous fan parties during the 2018 World Cup.\nRussia denies the measures constitute a formal curfew, and several Moscow region police officers were rebuked after driving through a commuter area and announcing a curfew had been declared.\nThe crackdown may have been provoked by images of Muscovites rushing out to buy last-minute flights to beach resorts, or heading to city parks to barbecue shashlik after the president, Vladimir Putin, announced a \u201cnon-working week\u201d beginning on Saturday.\nOn Sunday, an outdoor gym with homemade weights and exercise equipment was teeming with people, mainly men who said they had been coming to work out for years and would not stop now.\nThe mayor\u2019s office was outraged when staff saw news footage of Muscovites barbecuing shashlik on state television, BBC News Russian reported. In the original version of the news report, one Muscovite tells a journalist the virus \u201cdoesn\u2019t exist\u201d.",

The film is due out next year and the set was supposed to have been dismantled last weekend.\nInstead, it provides an eerie reminder of a bygone era when the streets were similarly deserted by many in fear of the German occupiers. A sign in the window of the fake pharmacy: \u201cDear customers, because of a lack of deliveries certain articles are out of stock\u201d, is an example of life imitating art imitating life.\nParis was occupied by Nazi Germany from 14 June 1940 until 24 August 1944. The puppet French state under Marshal Philippe P\u00e9tain relocated to Vichy, while Gen Charles de Gaulle organised the Free French and Resistance forces from London. During Nazi control of the city, French police rounded up Jews who were sent to the death camps.\nMeanwhile, the nightclubs of Montmartre remained open, profiting from a new clientele of German officers and soldiers, while night-time brought black marketeers on to the \u2019 streets.\nTim McInerney, a university lecturer in British and Irish cultural history in Paris and co-host of the Irish Passport podcast, tweeted: \u201cJust in case quarantined Paris wasn\u2019t disorientating enough: my neighbourhood was being used as a film set when the lockdown hit. Now the whole block has been left frozen in 1941\u201d.\nHe later said: \u201cParis is of course haunted by the legacy of the occupation. There\u2019s a school down the road that has a plaque telling you how many Jewish children were deported.\n\u201cThe dark shadows are already there so to recreate it is quite unsettling, even more so as a lot of things written on the posters are happening right now. One poster [from the film set] said everyone must keep off the streets between 11.30m and 4am, which seemed a little close to home as just before I\u2019d had to show my permit [to be outside] to the police. It\u2019s a strange situation.\u201d\nHe said parts of the film set had been pillaged and ripped down by souvenir hunters.",

In the absence of being able to continue to trade Carluccio\u2019s, in the short term, we are urgently focused on the options available to preserve the future of the business and protect its employees.\nAnalysts believe a substantial number of restaurant, retail and leisure businesses will struggle to survive in the coming weeks. Mark Brumby, a hospitality and leisure analyst at Langton Capital, predicted that five or six firms could collapse this week alone. The coronavirus outbreak, he said, had \u201chit the industry like a brick\u201d.\nBrightHouse\u2019s stores were also already closed under the government\u2019s coronavirus control measures but administrators said the business would continue delivering smaller items to homes and, where possible, would continue servicing items already in people\u2019s homes.\nChris Laverty, Andrew Charters and Sarah O\u2019Toole of Grant Thornton, who were appointed as joint administrators on Monday, said BrightHouse would not be making new rent-to-own or cash loan deals. They said existing clients should continue to make payments in the usual way.\nThe company \u2013 which sells household appliances and electrical goods on credit to primarily low-income customers \u2013 has been struggling for months after a regulatory crackdown on interest charges that reduced its income.\nBrightHouse, which is owned by a trio of investment funds, Alteri, Apollo and Highbridge, said costly compensation claims by customers after the crackdown were costing it \u00a31m every month.",

What if her four children, including her eight-year-old disabled son, Sumit, heavy in her arms, died here on the side of the road?\n\u201cThe road seemed endless, we had no money for food and my children just took short breaks sleeping on the ground,\u201d she said. But gritting her teeth and pushing hunger and exhaustion away, Mamta kept on walking.\nIt would take her six-person family almost five days on foot to make the 125-mile journey from Gurgaon, a satellite city to the capital, Delhi, to their village, Sidamai in Uttar Pradesh, as part of an exodus of millions of migrant workers and families last week unlike anything seen in India since partition.\nIt followed the announcement last Tuesday night by the prime minister, Narendra Modi, that for the next 21 days the entire country of 1.3 billion people would be under lockdown to prevent the spread of coronavirus. Shops, factories and restaurants would all be shut and people would be confined to their homes for all but essential activities.\nWhile it was met with approval by experts and health professionals, the lockdown has already proved catastrophic for India\u2019s millions of migrant and daily wage workers, who earn their salary hundreds or sometimes thousands of miles away from home and live a hand-to-mouth existence.\nWith no way to earn money and feed their families for at least three weeks, millions decided last week to head back to their villages in order to survive.\nWith trains and most buses suspended and taxis unaffordable, walking was the only option for many, and the sides of the highways were soon lined with people, bags slung over their shoulders, many with nothing but flip-flops on their feet. More than 20 migrant labourers have died over the past few days as they try to walk back home.\nMamta, 35, and her husband, both workers at automobile factories in Gurgaon that were shut during the lockdown, suddenly found themselves without a salary and no way to pay their rent or to buy food.\n\u201cTo survive, we had to go back to my village; we had no choice,\u201d she said. She described the five days that the family walked, starting out on Wednesday evening and finally arriving in Sidamai on Sunday afternoon, as \u201cmore terrible than anything I ever could have imagined\u201d.\nThey had nothing to eat except a dozen puri, fried Indian bread, that she had prepared with leftover flour before they left. The children wore through their shoes and their legs swelled up, meaning they often burst into tears out of pain. The family walked through the night, only stopping for short one-hour breaks.\n\u201cThe only thing that kept us moving was that we had nowhere else to go,\u201d said Mamta. \u201cBut even though we have arrived in the village we have no money for food. I don\u2019t know how we will survive. Hunger will kill us before coronavirus does.\u201d\nFulendra Kumar is among those migrant workers still walking. He set out last week from the industrial city of Ludhiana in Punjab and has already travelled on bus and foot 750 miles over the past week to reach Bihar, but still has another 200 to go before his final destination: the village of Araria.\n\u201cI worked in a snack factory in Ludhiana, but after lockdown the factory closed down and we faced starvation as we didn\u2019t have enough money,\u201d said Kumar, speaking as he took a rest in the city of Patna.\nOver the weekend, there were similar scenes of chaos at Delhi\u2019s Anand Vihar bus station, as hundreds of thousands of migrant workers gathered in an attempt to get on one of the limited buses still running. The crush of human bodies was the antithesis of the social distancing ordered by Modi, and the police responded by beating up workers who tried to board the buses.\nAmong them was Rama, 45, a daily wage worker who usually polishes office floors, who was attempting to get back to his home village of Gorapur in Andhra Pradesh.\n\u201cMy work has totally stopped so I have no money to survive and I have not eaten since yesterday, so that is why I needed to go back,\u201d said Rama. \u201cBut I was not the only one. The bus station was full of people like me, desperate to get out, and it was like hell.\n\u201cThere were crowds and everyone was being crushed and pulling each other out of the way, there was so much violence and police were charging at us with lathis [wooden rods].\u201d\nHe added: \u201cFor buses that had seats [for] 100 people, 200 people would be trying to cram in, people were sitting on top of the bus and hanging out of the windows. We were all desperate to leave because we cannot survive in Delhi under this lockdown.\u201d\nThe crammed mass of people at Delhi\u2019s bus stations and widespread migration of people across states and borders over the past few days has horrified India, both in terms of the hardships foisted on the already impoverished migrant workers and because it can only worsen the spread of coronavirus.\nCurrently there are about 1,000 known cases here, but testing remains low, and many suspect the real figure to be much higher. In a bid to stop people moving, on Sunday night the government ordered all state borders to be closed, and police began arresting those walking on the highways or who reached state borders on foot. Many migrants who did reach the Utter Pradesh border were also hosed down with a chemical solution by police.\nIn an effort to house the tens of thousand of returning migrants, schoolhouses and government buildings have now been turned into quarantine centres across the country. But in some places the situation has turned violent.\nLast week, a 50-year-old shopkeeper was killed by a group of four migrant workers at Chak-Udaipur village in Jharkhand\u2019s Palamu district. \u201cThe shopkeeper had objected to free movement by the migrant workers in the village but they turned furious and killed him,\u201d said Palamu district\u2019s superintendent, Ajay Linda.\nMigrant workers who have made it to their villages have often found they are no longer welcome. In several villages in Bihar and Jharkhand, villagers put up barricades at the entry points and hung posters, warning the migrants against entering the village before a health check.\n\u201cWe took this decision as outsiders\u2019 entry to the village could put everyone\u2019s life at risk,\u201d said Umesh Singh, 60, a schoolteacher from the village of Baniya-Yadupur in Bihar. \u201cThis is very dangerous time and we can\u2019t ignore this.\u201d",

Studying these creatures while based in London necessitated frequent trips to the Marine Biological Association in Plymouth in order to collect specimens. There, equipped with wellington boots, forks and collecting boxes, Rodney and his students gathered such wonders as the evocatively named Cirratulus, the bright red Terebella and his favourite worm, Neoamphitrite.\nRodney was born in Romford, Essex, the son of Sidney Dales, an architect, and his wife, Muriel (nee Tattersall), who assisted in the architectural practice. During the second world war the family moved to Biddenden, Kent.\nFollowing school at Brentwood, Rodney went to Queen Mary College in London to study zoology and then to MIT on a Fulbright scholarship. Returning to the UK, he worked briefly at King\u2019s College London for Rosalind Franklin whose research on X-ray diffraction studies was central to the discovery of DNA. On completing his PhD he joined the zoology department at Bedford College.\nAnxious to share his expertise, he wrote numerous books, chapters and research papers many of which he illustrated with his own line drawings. His Annelids (1963) remains the go-to reference book on the subject. He attracted doctoral students from across the globe, and it is a testimony to the affectionate regard in which he was held that many stayed in touch long after they themselves were running university departments.\nHe was appointed head of the zoology department at Bedford College in 1970, later becoming dean of science. In 1985, following a series of reorganisations, Bedford merged with Royal Holloway College and moved to Egham, in Surrey. There he was head of a much larger zoology department - a role in which his insights into how creatures adapt to challenging environments occasionally came in useful. He retired in 1992.\nIn retirement he pursued his varied interests with typical energy and undiminished curiosity. Never without a sketchbook, he took a degree in fine art printmaking; and on family holidays would often disappear, reappearing later with wonderful pen and ink and watercolour drawings of Breton ports, alpine peaks, or the flora of the Gower Peninsula. And he continued to write. His last published book, in 2018, was on a special passion, timber framed buildings. He was writing up until three weeks before his death - notably a series of illustrated short stories for his granddaughter.\nRodney is survived by his wife, Margaret (nee Kidd), whom he married in 1955, by three of their five children, and by two granddaughters and three grandsons. Two sons predeceased him.",

You write as if you have witnessed society being picked up and turned over, its vulnerable underbelly exposed. Your words express so poignantly how we are feeling and are likely to be feeling in the weeks (or months) that lie ahead.

From Sperlonga to Cagliari, Rome to Verona, we have mingled with your people, sat in cafes encouraging our children to order in Italian. We have pointed out street signs and notices, asking them to translate.\nLast Thursday night we turned to our children again, asking for a translation of Pope Francis\u2019s address to the world. They told us he was urging us to have faith, that we are all passengers in the same boat. In the rain, from an almost empty St Peter\u2019s Square, we thought he looked and sounded like a broken man.\nA couple of months ago, I draped the Italian flag around my shoulders as I joined friends at a vigil on the eve of Brexit day. As we bade farewell to our European community, we sang defiantly, denying that we Scots were severing any connection. Weeks later we watch bewildered as Italy and other nations have been brought to their knees. Your message reminds us that even in these deadly times, solidarity and friendship endure.

        "content": "Readers respond to David Runciman\u2019s article about balancing of individual liberties with the need for collective safety\nDavid Runciman makes a number of compelling points in his analysis of Hobbes\u2019 relevance to understanding how coronavirus has revealed the nature of political power (Coronavirus has not suspended politics \u2013 it has revealed the nature of power, 27 March).\nHowever, there is another way of thinking about the relevance of Hobbes\u2019 political philosophy to our viral times. The Leviathan was condemned on publication as the work of a dangerous radical. Hobbes showed that political power was an invention. There was nothing \u201cgiven\u201d or divinely ordained about the legal order founded by the Leviathan \u2013 it was invented by those who agreed that the Leviathan was necessary.\nHobbes\u2019 lesson is that a democracy can be seen as an invented political order. Surely, this is now the moment when we can collectively make some radical choices. The general quarantining of politics gives us the space to imagine a fairer, greener and more decent world: the Leviathan is our invention. The Leviathan is our collective, democratic power.Prof Adam GeareySchool of law, Birkbeck College, University of London\n David Runciman speaks of \u201cthe democratic imperative to seek consensus\u201d. Yes. But when it comes to elections, the imperative of any political party is to get the votes in. A party will have forged a sort of consensus if it can get enough votes in, whatever its unspoken ideology and whether or not its leader and its candidates are honest.\nRunciman says our political world is still recognisably Hobbesian. There seems to me to be something right about that if the political world is the world of our government, with a governing party that\u2019s a strange mix of libertarian and authoritarian. The libertarian prime minister manifestly found it difficult to recognise that the principle of \u201cpersonal freedom\u201d had to be abandoned if the pandemic was to be fought. The authoritarian home secretary manifestly delighted in announcing punishments for infractions, with nothing about why they were thought necessary.\nPoliticians could do better than the latest slogan \u201cFlatten the curve\u201d. They could explain the massive difference social distancing makes to reducing the spread of any communicable disease. Perhaps the present government\u2019s recent electioneering targeted the nastier and more brutish among us. But there\u2019s now a message that needs to be received by everyone. And it would be good if they could appreciate the power of persuading using simple facts.Jennifer HornsbyLondon\n I feel that Prof Runciman may be right about a layer of politics being stripped away and, as he describes it, \u201ca trade off between personal liberty and collective choice\u201d. Addressing his nation on the Edison phonograph at the start of the first world war, Kaiser Wilhelm II concluded with the words, \u201cI recognise no parties any more, only Germans\u201d.\nWhether we like it or not, what we are now in the middle of is a war; but not as we know it. Wilhelm was the head, despite the trappings of democracy, of a basically autocratic regime, which sought to shore up its power by enlisting patriotism, and it worked for a while as it also did in Tsarist Russia, Austria-Hungary and Ottoman Turkey.\nBut you can\u2019t fight an enemy you can\u2019t see with guns and you can\u2019t negotiate with a virus. My wife and I stood at our front door last Thursday evening clapping and banging a saucepan, as did many people on our road. Times like this make me realise what is important in life. I just hope that, to return to the first world war, we\u2019re not \u201clions led by donkeys\u201d.John MarriottNorth Hykeham, Lincolnshire",

For-profit funds oppose the idea.\nThere is no suggestion any super fund is at risk of collapse. Rather, industry sources fear that the forced sale of assets would crush their value, crimping returns for people who remain in the fund.\nRBA officials are believed to be concerned that smaller funds with smaller average member balances would be more likely to be forced into an asset fire-sale.\nIt is believed bank officials have considered a range of options.\nAs Guardian Australia has reported, one option favoured by some in the super industry is that the RBA would lend money to funds, which would put up some of their assets as collateral in much the same way as a house secures a home loan from a bank.\nWhen the crisis passes, the funds would pay off their loan and the RBA would return them their assets.\nThe RBA already does similar things for banks by purchasing baskets of assets such as government bonds and home loans from banks and selling them back. But it is understood extending the favour to super funds would be considerably more complicated for both legal and practical reasons.\nIn an opinion article in Nine newspapers on Monday, Bragg, a longtime critic of Australia\u2019s compulsory super system, said \u201cmismanagement\u201d was to blame if funds did not immediately have cash on hand to meet the expected flood of redemptions.\nHowever, University of Melbourne finance professor Kevin Davis said Bragg\u2019s criticisms were \u201cunbalanced and unfair\u201d because super funds could not have known the government would suddenly allow a flood of withdrawals.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s outrageous to be writing ideological pieces at the moment,\u201d Davis, who served on the Financial System Inquiry in 2013, told Guardian Australia. \u201cAnd he\u2019s wrong about most of the things he\u2019s saying.\u201d\nHume played down the scale of the potential withdrawals, saying that $27bn would be \u201cless than 1% of a circa $3tn superannuation system\u201d .\nShe said about $7bn might have to come from selling shares, which was \u201cthe equivalent of a single day\u2019s turnover of the ASX\u201d.\nBut Davis said \u201cmassive changes\u201d in the price of shares could happen even without any changing hands. \u201cIf everyone thought there was going to be a massive sell-off by super funds, then everyone will adjust their view of prices downwards.\u201d\nIn a detailed response to Bragg published on his website, Davis said he favoured super funds being allowed to borrow from the RBA.\nHe said super fund members would then in turn be allowed to borrow cash against their personal balances, \u201cwith member repayments of their loan to begin only when their incomes have recovered sufficiently\u201d.\n\u201cA zero interest rate could apply in both cases, although I think that would be anathema to senator Bragg.\u201d",

        "content": "Experts weigh in on whether coronavirus will dissipate during the summer and warn against letting up on physical distancing\nThe seasonal flu tends to dissipate during the summer, leading some to hope the coronavirus will do the same. Experts explain why transmission of some illnesses lowers with warmer temperatures \u2013 and warn against lowering our guard.\nDr Marc Lipsitch: What makes seasonal viruses seasonal is a combination of opportunities for transmission \u2013 whether school is in term, which facilitates transmission \u2013 and what proportion of the population is immune, combined with weather.\nHumidity is lower in the winter, which is good for transmission. Low humidity makes [virus-carrying] droplets settle more slowly because they shrink to smaller sizes and then friction keeps them in the air, whereas high humidity doesn\u2019t do that.\nDr Lee W Riley: People still get the common cold [in the summer] and we\u2019re beginning to see this new coronavirus in the southern hemisphere. It\u2019s more about the way people behave.\nLipsitch: Based on our best estimates from other coronaviruses, summer alone is not going to bring transmission to a level where the number of cases shrinks. It\u2019s just going to grow more slowly.\nIt\u2019s really clear that warmer weather does not stop the transmission or growth of the virus. That\u2019s clear from Australia, Singapore and Hong Kong. Singapore and Hong Kong have kept it to a large degree under control, but that\u2019s with incredibly intense control measures. There\u2019s no question that coronaviruses are capable of transmitting in hotter, humid climates.\nDr George Rutherford: Thinking that it\u2019s magically going to go away in April or May or whenever is just that \u2013 magical thinking. The projections show quite a bit of transmission out through the summer.\nRiley: It\u2019s a completely new virus, so it\u2019s really hard to know what would happen. If you try to extrapolate from [related] viruses, then we don\u2019t expect for this new coronavirus to completely disappear by the summer.\nRiley: A reintroduction of the epidemic is certainly possible; it\u2019s beginning to happen in Hong Kong. Hong Kong successfully controlled the epidemic early on, and they started relaxing some of their restrictions. Now they\u2019re beginning to see new cases reappear.\nRutherford: In 2009, we saw a second wave of the swine flu. It started in the spring in Mexico. Some schools in the United States got out early for the summer, and when [students] went back in the fall, it came back in a bump. That [outbreak] was blunted because a vaccine came out that fall. That\u2019s not going to happen here. We\u2019re going to have to temporize until a vaccine arrives.\nLipsitch: If we let up on social distancing before a large fraction of the population is immune, there could be a second peak of infections in the fall, when it\u2019s most contagious, due to school being back in session and cooler temperatures. And that would be the worst possible outcome.\nLipsitch: If our strategy is to use social distancing as our main control measure because we haven\u2019t figured out anything better, then the best way to do it is to distance until we bring cases down to low enough levels that we can let transmission resume by relaxing social distancing, and have several weeks or months where we don\u2019t overwhelm the healthcare system.\nAnd then we distance again, and repeat the cycle. With each cycle, we\u2019ll get more time off social distancing, because the buildup of immunity in the population helps to slow the spread. So you don\u2019t get to the dangerous peak as quickly.\nThat [scenario] will be destructive to the economy, to education, and all sorts of things. But as a means of trying to preserve the healthcare system, if we don\u2019t have another approach, it may be our best option.\nI want to be clear: as an epidemiologist, I\u2019m saying what I think existing tools make possible for the purposes of disease control, and not what I think is socially desirable. Multiple rounds of social distancing are not something I look forward to.\nRiley: It\u2019s conceivable that we may have to do another round of lockdowns, but we need to look even further ahead. What\u2019s going to happen next year? Is it going to come back again like the influenza? Is a new type of coronavirus going to come back? Maybe not next year, but maybe, two years from now? This is not the only time we\u2019re going to be doing these lockdowns.\nRutherford: I think as shelter in place starts to get peeled back, it\u2019s going to need to be replaced with something more along the South Korean model of aggressive contact tracing, quarantine and isolation, and that\u2019s going to be the bridge to get us out to when the vaccine comes in. Given the hit on the economy that\u2019s going on now, there\u2019s going to be a lot of enthusiasm for the South Korean model.\nLipsitch: If we can do that, it\u2019s great. The challenge is that reintroductions are a constant threat. We\u2019ve seen it in China. They\u2019re trying to go back to work while doing control based on individual cases, but they\u2019ve had multiple introductions from outside the country now. I think it\u2019s what we should aim for, but I\u2019m not hugely optimistic that it will work.\nRiley: South Korea and Hong Kong had really efficient contact tracing programs, where they would quarantine the contacts of symptomatic people who were diagnosed with coronavirus. It was a much more focused approach to controlling transmission.\nThe problem in the US is we don\u2019t have that kind of manpower, and that\u2019s probably something that the US really needs to start looking into in a very serious way, because we just totally neglected our public health system infrastructure.\nPanel:\nDr Marc Lipsitch, professor of epidemiology and director, Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics, Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health\nDr Lee W Riley, professor and chair of the Division of Infectious Disease and Vaccinology, UC\u2013Berkeley School of Public Health\nDr George Rutherford, professor of epidemiology and biostatistics, director, Prevention and Public Health Group, UCSF",

Official figures show that, as of 5pm on Sunday (BST), 1,408 people across the country have died.\nThe death toll from an outbreak of coronavirus in Italy has climbed by 812 to 11,591, the country\u2019s civil protection agency says, reversing two days of declines in the daily rate. But the number of new cases rose by just 4,050; the lowest nominal increase since 17 March. A total 101,739 people have now tested positive.\nAs many as 200,000 people in the US may die even if Washington plays its response to the outbreak \u201calmost perfectly\u201d, according Dr Deborah Birx, the response coordinator for the White House coronavirus taskforce.\n\u201cIf we do things together well, almost perfectly, we could get in the range of 100,000 to 200,000 fatalities,\u201d she told told NBC News\u2019 Today.

Netanyahu is due to undergo a coronavirus test. A previous test he took was negative.\nIndigenous leaders from across the continent are warning that the outbreak poses an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to them.

Dubai was pinning many of its economic forecasts on the trade it was expected to generate.\nIntroducing the requirement is a \u201cnecessary step\u201d to help to prevent the airborne transmission of the virus, says the Austrian chancellor, Sebastian Kurz.

But the death toll is rising and some are voicing dissent\nThe \u00d8resund Bridge \u2013 yes, that bridge \u2013 is an engineering marvel linking the Swedish city of Malm\u00f6 and Copenhagen that normally transports 70,000 people daily. It has fallen eerily silent. Denmark is under coronavirus lockdown, and the Danes have imposed strict border controls. On the Swedish side, the \u00d8resund remains open, although, understandably not many are making that journey.\nIt feels surreal in Sweden just now. Working from my local cafe, I terror-scroll through Twitter seeing clips of deserted cities, or army trucks transporting the dead in Italy, surrounded by the usual groups of chatty teenagers, mothers with babies and the occasional freelancer.\nOutdoors, couples stroll arm in arm in the spring sunshine; Malm\u00f6\u2019s cafe terraces do a brisk trade. On the beach and surrounding parkland at Sibbarp there were picnics and barbecues this weekend; the adjoining skate park and playground were rammed. No one was wearing a mask.\nThe global pandemic has closed down Europe\u2019s economies and confined millions of people across the continent to their homes. But here, schools, gyms, and (fully stocked) shops remain open, as do the borders. Bars and restaurants continue to serve, and trains and buses are still shuttling people all over the country. You can even, if you wish, go to the cinema (it smainly indie fare: The Peanut Butter Falcon and Mr Jones were on at my local arthouse over the weekend).\nThe precautions that Swedes have been advised to adopt \u2013 no gatherings of more than 50 people (revised down from 500 last Friday), avoid social contact if over 70 or ill, try to work from home, table service only in bars and restaurants \u2013 seem to have allayed public fears that the shocking images from hospitals in Italy and Spain could be repeated here.\nThe prime minister, Stefan L\u00f6fven, has urged Swedes to behave \u201cas adults\u201d and not to spread \u201cpanic or rumours\u201d.\nPanic, though, is exactly what many within Sweden\u2019s scientific and medical community are starting to feel. A petition signed by more than 2,000 doctors, scientists, and professors last week \u2013 including the chairman of the Nobel Foundation, Prof Carl-Henrik Heldin \u2013 called on the government to introduce more stringent containment measures. \u201cWe\u2019re not testing enough, we\u2019re not tracking, we\u2019re not isolating enough \u2013 we have let the virus loose,\u201d said Prof Cecilia S\u00f6derberg-Naucl\u00e9r, a virus immunology researcher at the Karolinska Institute. \u201cThey are leading us to catastrophe.\u201d\nStrong words, but stoicism is a way of life here, as is unflappability. A 300-year history of efficient and transparent public administration, and high levels of trust in experts and governing officials, have left the public inclined to believe what they are told, and that those doing the telling have their best interests at heart.\n\u201cI trust that the doctors working with the government know what they are doing, so I suppose we\u2019re as well prepared as we can be,\u201d Robert Andersson, 50, a vendor manager in IT who lives in S\u00f6dermalm, Stockholm, said. \u201cThis \u2018hysteria\u2019 that the media is launching is far more dangerous than the virus itself.\u201d\nSimon Strand, 30, a business consultant in \u00d6stermalm, Stockholm, agrees. \u201cThere is no reason to believe the authorities are not paying attention,\u201d he said.\nAnders Tegnell, Sweden\u2019s chief epidemiologist, who is leading the government\u2019s handling of the crisis, advocates a strategy of mitigation: allow the virus to spread slowly without overwhelming the health system, and without recourse to draconian restrictions. Just don\u2019t call it \u201cherd immunity\u201d, a phrase that Tegnell, and the authorities, have steadfastly refused to use.\nIt says much for the transparency and accountability that Swedes expect from public figures that Tegnell remains so accessible to the media. With criticism of Sweden\u2019s response to Covid-19 mounting, he has the slightly exasperated tone of a man tired of repeating the obvious when asked what he thinks of the growing concern and calls for a city-wide quarantine of Stockholm, given the very recent spike in cases there. On Monday, Sweden said it had recorded 3,700 cases and 110 deaths.\n\u201cYes, there has been an increase but it\u2019s not traumatic so far. Of course, we\u2019re going into a phase in the epidemic where we\u2019ll see a lot more cases in the next few weeks, more people in the ICU, but that\u2019s just like any other country \u2013 nowhere has been able to slow down the spread considerably.\u201d\nSweden\u2019s nearest EU neighbours \u2013 the Danes, Finns, and Norwegians \u2013 have accepted a lockdown strategy, closing schools, workplaces, and borders weeks ago. \u201cThe problem with that approach is you tire the system out,\u201d Tegnell said. \u201cYou can\u2019t keep a lockdown going for months \u2013 it\u2019s impossible.\u201d\nBut such a situation may become inevitable. \u201cThe government thinks they can\u2019t stop it, so they\u2019ve decided to let people die,\u201d S\u00f6derberg-Naucl\u00e9r said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to listen to the scientific data that\u2019s presented to them. They trust the Public Health Agency [Folkh\u00e4lsomyndigheten] blindly, but the data they have is weak \u2013 embarrassing even.\n\u201cWe are seeing signs of a higher doubling rate than Italy, Stockholm will soon have an acute ICU shortage, and they don\u2019t understand that by then it will be too late to act. All of this is very dangerous.\u201d\nTegnell gives such criticism short shrift: \u201cThere is no evidence whatsoever that doing more at this stage would make any difference. It\u2019s far better to introduce stringent measures at very specific intervals, and keep them running for as little time as possible.\u201d\nWhile there is a constant reappraisal of the situation, Tegnell says Sweden has the crisis under control. \u201cWe believe we have the most important measures in place already.

        "content": "Online grocer unable to explain why 100,000 kits ordered from China cost far less than others\nOnline food retailer Ocado has sourced 100,000 coronavirus tests for its workers from China, it has emerged, raising concerns over their quality after thousands of other kits bought from the country have had to be returned because they were substandard.\nThe grocery home delivery company confirmed over the weekend it had spent \u00a31.5m on Covid-19 tests to protect staff and customers, in an effort to keep its business going throughout the lockdown following a surge in orders.\nBut the Guardian has established that the tests \u2013 which cost \u00a315 each, much less than other kits \u2013 have been sourced from China, where tens of thousands have already been returned by the Spanish government over quality issues.\nOcado confirmed the tests came from China but declined to name which firm it had bought them from, or why they appeared to be so cheap. About 60,000 of the tests have not yet been delivered. The union representing Ocado\u2019s workers is now urgently seeking assurances over the quality of the tests.\nRecently the Spanish government\u2019s health ministry was forced to withdraw 58,000 kits purchased indirectly from a Chinese company, after quality concerns were raised when it emerged they had a detection rate of just 30%. Ocado said the test it had bought was not from this firm, but would not name the company.\nMeanwhile, there have been similar quality concerns over face masks and tests supplied by Chinese firms in the Netherlands and Turkey.\nNorthern Ireland-based firm Randox Laboratories has been selling home Covid-19 testing kits for \u00a3120 \u2013 eight times more expensive than the model bought by Ocado. Other companies have been advertising them for as much as \u00a3295.\nAsked about where the testing kits had been sourced from and why they were so cheap, an Ocado Group spokesman confirmed to the Guardian: \u201cThey\u2019re from suppliers in China.\u201d\nThe spokesman was unable to account for the significantly cheaper price. The kits will be used to test Ocado delivery drivers and grocery packers, both of whom are classed as \u201ckey workers\u201d under government guidelines, affording them certain privileges such as permission to send their children to school.\nNews of the Ocado kits came as concern grows over frontline NHS workers, including doctors and nurses, accessing coronavirus tests. Ocado has already promised to hand over its tests to the NHS if required.\nA spokesman for the Union of Shop Distributive & Allied Workers (Usdaw), which represents Ocado workers, said: \u201cWhile recognising that the company\u2019s intention is to provide reassurance for staff, Usdaw is seeking urgent assurances from Ocado over the quality of their Covid-19 testing kits, as it is widely acknowledged that poor tests can be more problematic than no tests at all.\n\u201cUsdaw remains of the view that the best way to provide reassurance to staff is to ensure they can make decisions based on their health and wellbeing. To that end, the union welcomed the company\u2019s decision to amend their policies to provide greater certainty to staff during this time, including pay from day one during self-isolation. The union continues to advise members to observe the necessary hygiene and social distancing advice from government, regardless of any test results.\u201d\nPublic Health England warns against the purchase of Covid-19 home tests from private manufacturers as there is \u201clittle information on the accuracy of the tests, or on how a patient\u2019s antibody response develops or changes during Covid-19 infection\u201d, and \u201cit is not known whether either a positive or negative result is reliable\u201d.\nAn Ocado spokesman said: \u201cA process is in place to test the quality and efficacy of the kits before they are rolled out to our frontline staff.\u201d",

        "content": "Britain\u2019s two-time taekwondo gold medallist is staying positive following the Tokyo Games move to summer 2021 \u2013 partly because it means she can still create history\nA week since the Tokyo Olympics were postponed in response to the coronavirus outbreak there is a need among the athletes affected to move on and focus on the positives. That is certainly what Jade Jones is doing. The two-time taekwondo gold medallist admits she felt \u201cgutted\u201d following last Tuesday\u2019s news but now her mindset has well and truly changed.\nThe pursuit of history is key to why Jones is refusing to mope. Tokyo offers her the chance to become the first athlete in her sport to claim three Olympic golds and she is ultimately relieved that she can still achieve that milestone. \u201cIf the Olympics had been cancelled, as opposed to postponed, that would\u2019ve broken me as I wouldn\u2019t then have had a chance to do what no one else in taekwondo has ever done,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m just grateful the Olympics are still on.\n\u201cMentally, it\u2019s tough. I\u2019ve been training for four years for that one moment and, as an athlete, you try to peak for that. All the training and preparation is geared towards that \u2026 and then it\u2019s gone. But it had got to the stage where it was hard to carry on anyway as all of our training camps and competitions were getting cancelled. At least after last week\u2019s announcement we now know where we stand. We also have another year to become even better athletes.\u201d\nJust over a year, in fact, after the International Olympic Committee announced on Monday that the Games will begin on 23 July next year, with the Paralympic Games starting on 24 August. When athletes will be able to start training and competing given enforced self\u2011isolation is another matter and while that is naturally a worry for all concerned it is not a huge issue for Jones given she has been able to set up a gym at the house she shares in Manchester with friend and fellow British taekwondo competitor, Bianca Walkden.\n\u201cAs soon as we were told the Team GB academy was shutting we zoomed down there in the car, grabbed as much kit as we could and took it home,\u201d says Jones. \u201cWe then chucked everything we had in the garage and spent a day fixing it up. I\u2019m actually quite chuffed with it. And I\u2019ve always wanted a home gym, so at least that\u2019s something I\u2019ve been able to achieve during all of this.\n\u201cI\u2019m also spending time allowing my body to recover. As an athlete training takes a big toll on you, so I\u2019m getting all the right nutrients down me as well as using the recovering stuff that\u2019s been provided by my sponsors, Under Armour. I\u2019m trying to turn every second at home into a positive.\u201d\nBut that can be difficult. Jones is missing seeing her family back in north Wales \u2013 \u201cnot being able to go home and give them a hug is hard\u201d \u2013 and there is only so far forcing yourself to look on the bright side can go when you have had the rug sharply pulled from underneath your feet.\nJones should be in a pre-Olympics training camp right now before flying out to Tokyo on 14 July. And there is little doubt the 27-year-old stood an excellent chance of securing that third succcessive gold medal in the Japanese capital. Quite simply, Jones is one of the very best around in her sport, as shown by the world championship gold she secured in Manchester last May.\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to lie, it took me a few days to get my head around the fact the Olympics were not going to take place this summer,\u201d she says. \u201cI found out at the same time as everyone else, while watching the news, and I was gutted.\n\u201cFortunately at GB Taekwondo we have a psychologist [Dr Steve Peters] and he called me up on the day of the announcement to check how I was, which helped. That support remains there and as an athlete you\u2019re used to dealing with adversity. So that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing.\n\u201cBesides, sport is pretty unimportant right now. What is important is the health of my family and friends and everybody around the world.\u201d\nThat much is true and, eventually, life will return to normal. For Jones that will mean getting out of her home gym and into the one she uses at Team GB\u2019s academy, working alongside her coach, Martin Stamper, and gearing up for what is now next year\u2019s 2020 Games.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s for sure is that it\u2019s going to be a crappy couple of months and my biggest worry is that spending all this time at home will lead to me getting fat,\u201d Jones says with a laugh. \u201cBut it will end at some point and then it will be a case of re-planning for the Olympics and making sure I\u2019m once again in peak condition at the right time. That\u2019s a lot to take in right now but I\u2019m ready for the challenge. A champion always finds a way.\u201d",

        "content": "Alanyaspor defender on Turkish football, how he stays out of \u2018a dark place\u2019 and what the world can learn from coronavirus crisis\n\u201cI scored the winner and I didn\u2019t even celebrate,\u201d Steven Caulker says of his goal in Alanyaspor\u2019s behind-closed-doors victory over Gaziantep. It was one of the final games before the Super Lig was suspended in Turkey, one of the last countries to take the decision amid the coronavirus outbreak.\nAtmospheres in Turkey are known for being boisterous and vociferous, and the absence of supporters was a reminder of what makes football the game it is. With and without fans it has been a successful season for Alanyaspor, who sit sixth in the table and lead their cup semi-final against Antalyaspor 1-0 heading into the second leg at home. The club has never won major honours in its 72-year history.\n\u201cWe tried it one week here without fans and it wasn\u2019t good,\u201d says Caulker, who joined Alanyaspor in January 2019. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t enjoyable. It made me appreciate more playing in front of fans every week, especially when you go to the big Istanbul clubs. I have never experienced an atmosphere like those in Istanbul, even in the Premier League. The atmospheres are really special and without that, what is football? It is really hostile at these grounds but I love it. That is what I play football for, it gives you a real buzz. I am glad they stopped the league as without the fans it\u2019s not the same.\u201d\nAlthough lifting a trophy is still part of the thinking for all involved at Alanyaspor, the players and staff have not lost perspective. The league\u2019s authorities were criticised for delaying the postponement of fixtures and no one knows when matches will restart. Players have returned to training to maintain fitness but are permitted to work only in pairs, with four allowed on site at any time. Away from football, social distancing is being maintained.\n\u201cWe\u2019re all being sensible about it, in the sense that the priority of everyone at the club is our health: the health of our families, the health of our supporters and the people of the city. Yes, it is frustrating, but there are definitely bigger things at stake. We\u2019re just trying to do our bit by staying at home as much as possible.\n\u201cAlanya is a coastal city, it\u2019s about 25 degrees right now and it\u2019s got the beach. It relies on tourism but the place is empty as tourists can\u2019t get into the country, so the restaurants are closed and only offering home delivery; the cafes are closed. It\u2019s not a lockdown but they are strongly advising people to stay home and to not go out unless it\u2019s absolutely necessary.\u201d\nAs a player, Caulker is known for his calm demeanour and he is maintaining such an outlook off the pitch. However, the former Tottenham and Queens Park Rangers defender\u2019s son and parents are in England, keeping him apart from his loved ones. \u201cMy family are back home, which I do find really tough. I had flights to go straight back after the Istanbul game on Sunday but all the flights were cancelled, so it\u2019s really difficult. At times like these, I want to be with my loved ones but thankfully we have video calls to stay connected as much as possible.\u201d\nCaulker has spoken about his battle with addiction in the past and maintains routine to keep up with his Alcoholics Anonymous 12-step programme. The defender prays and writes gratitude lists every day in addition to helping others. \u201cIn order to come out of a dark place it has taken a lot of work and a lot of self-inventory and I maintain a lot of that still to this day. Every morning I write down 10 things that I am grateful for. It can be things like access to food and clean water, earning a regular income and being able to keep a roof above my family\u2019s head.\n\u201cI do my bit by speaking to others in a similar situation on a daily basis, whether it\u2019s a couple of young footballers who I speak with or someone in a similar position to me. We talk through stuff, like their struggles, and we spend 10 to 15 minutes on the phone \u2013 it\u2019s a safe space for them and me to share stuff and that sets me up for my day nicely and keeps me grounded which is important.\u201d\nAs coronavirus takes a firm grip across the globe, Caulker, who has travelled to Africa and India to carry out charity work and has witnessed the daily suffering in those countries, is looking for light at the end of the tunnel. \u201cWhat an opportunity this is to come together, to unite, to learn \u2013 there are so many lessons to come out of this. Football has been stripped back, the banks are closed, everything is on hold. What we are left with is each other and it is important for us to remember that. Right now the world is experiencing this but the likes of Iraq and Syria have been experiencing this for a long time.\n\u201cWhen the world does heal from this virus, I think that it is important that we remember that there are still people suffering in Africa, India and Syria and we can all do our bit to support it. It doesn\u2019t have to be financially, as you can see now there is a lot of kindness in people, just making phone calls or going round to make sure people are OK.\u201d\nFootballers are often the ones who receive the headlines and public praise but Caulker says others merit the limelight. \u201cThere are so many key workers out there that we need to appreciate, from the medical staff to the bin men that are keeping the streets clean. These jobs are so important to our society and it is important that we take a step back to make sure we see and appreciate them.\u201d",

        "content": "Founder is embroiled in a row with the airline as he demands it ditches an order for 107 Airbus aircraft\nGrounding its entire fleet of planes was the easy bit for easyJet. Now comes the tricky task of negotiating in public with Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, who, metaphorically speaking, is threatening to storm the cockpit and take hostages.\nThe founder and 34% shareholder (with a couple of siblings) says he will call a shareholder meeting to fire one easyJet non-executive director every seven weeks unless the board does what he wants, which is to abandon an order for 107 Airbus aircraft due to arrive in batches until 2023.\nAt a simple level, Haji-Ioannou makes a fair point about the Airbus order being \u201cthe largest single threat to the solvency of the company\u201d. Even cabin-fevered punters won\u2019t necessarily come rushing back when lockdowns in Europe end. They may fear more viral outbreaks and stay at home to repair their bank balances. If so, adding new aircraft in an oversupplied market would be risky.\nEasyJet\u2019s board, though, will surely realise as much. It will already be exploring the Airbus contract for ways to defer deliveries. Since all big aircraft orders tend to come with moveable dates, there will be room for flexibility.\nThe problem, though, is that Haji-Ioannou isn\u2019t asking for greater flexibility; he wants outright cancellation and, over time, a smaller easyJet fleet. The gap in strategic expectations looks wide.\nHaji-Ioannou lost a fight in 2011 to ditch the then chairman in the last row about aircraft orders, so there is no guarantee he would win a rolling series of votes now. But there is a complicating factor this time: the possible need to recapitalise easyJet.\nHaji-Ioannou says he would support a rights issue \u2013 as he should given that his family has collected \u00a3620m in dividends since 2011, including \u00a360m this month \u2013 but he is vowing to make his backing dependent on an Airbus cancellation. Given the size of his shareholding, he has some clout.\nWhat should the chairman, John Barton, and chief executive, Johan Lundgren, do? Well, they should start by providing some much-needed clarity on easyJet\u2019s financial position. Describing the current setup as \u201cstrong\u201d is currently fair given that the company says it has \u00a31.6bn of cash and $500m (\u00a3405m) of credit facilities. But what\u2019s the rate of cash-burn? EasyJet hasn\u2019t said, but the figure is critical.\nThe other requirement is detail on any revision to the Airbus deal. If Barton and Lundgren can provide that, they would stand a decent chance of rallying other shareholders and facing down Haji-Ioannou. But they do need to get a move on. The first rule of rights issues is to go early.\nThe most urgent problem in British banking, from the point of view of protecting the economy, is not the payment of \u00a37.5bn of dividends to shareholders over the next few weeks.\nRather, it is the pace at which banks are processing loan applications and converting the government\u2019s \u00a3330bn support package into hard cash in the hands of crisis-hit companies. Speed matters when trying to minimise failures and job losses.\nFrustrated borrowers\u2019 complaints about delay and red tape have clearly rattled the Treasury, the Bank of England and the Financial Conduct Authority, which is why the regulatory trio dispatched a \u201churry up\u201d letter to lenders last week.\nThe dividend question, then, is secondary. Yet a six-month ban on distributions to shareholders, copying the European Central Bank\u2019s move last week, would still be the right thing to do \u2013 for two reasons.\nFirst, nobody knows how long the crisis will last. Preserving bank capital now would help to create confidence that the UK economy is capable of rebounding quickly with banks\u2019 support after the lockdown. If the economic damage turns out to be slighter than feared, the current crop of announced dividends could always be reinstated later.\nSecond, it\u2019s surely useful for policymakers to be seen to be whipping the banks firmly. The sector was bailed out in the last crisis, so needs to be seen publicly to be throwing everything at addressing the current one. If not, borrowers\u2019 grumbles about foot-dragging lenders will become a running sub-plot.\nThe first dividend of this season is Barclays\u2019 \u00a31bn distribution, due to be paid on Friday. So, in practice, Threadneedle Street has about 24 hours to decide whether to allow it. Best to err on the side of caution and say no to all banks\u2019 dividends for a while.",

In some cases, officers are permanently based at the school to intervene in the early stages of any criminal or disorderly behaviour and forge good relationships between the school and police.\nThe legal action has been brought against the Metropolitan police on behalf of the family of a 14-year-old boy, who is black and has autism. The boy was investigated by the Crown Prosecution Service after he got into a verbal altercation with a member of staff at his school.\nWhile the family is not challenging the principle of deploying police officers in schools, its lawyers say the case raises significant concerns over the failure by police to monitor, assess and understand the implications of the practice in terms of equality.\nThey argue the Met has failed to comply with the public sector equality duty while deploying officers in schools as part of its safer schools partnerships. The high court has granted permission for a judicial review of the case, and a substantive hearing is expected later this year.\nThere is also a broader concern that incidents which should be a school matter, such as sanctions imposed by a headteacher, can too quickly escalate into a police matter when an officer is on hand, jeopardising a child\u2019s future unnecessarily.\nIn the case brought against the Met, the headteacher imposed a three-day suspension as punishment for the altercation, but a member of staff involved complained directly to the school officer, triggering the investigation.\nThe CPS dropped the case, but the family\u2019s lawyers say it has had a lasting effect on the boy, who has anxiety issues which have since worsened.\nDan Rosenberg, an education law expert at Simpson Millar who is representing the family, said: \u201cDeploying police officers in schools may have benefits for students and the wider school community, and no one is disputing that, least of all our client.\n\u201cHowever, it was important to clarify whether the presence of police officers in schools may have disproportionately negative consequences for black and ethnic minority boys and/or children with special education needs and disabilities, causing them to be drawn into the criminal justice system unnecessarily.\u201d\nPolice officers have long had good contacts with local schools, but the issue of officers being attached to schools full-time came to the fore recently after an increase in youth knife crime, particularly in the capital last year.\nMark Simmons, an assistant commissioner at the Met, told a parliamentary hearing last March that there were then 420 police officers with full-time roles in schools in the capital, and that the aim was to get the total up to just under 600 as part of an effort to combat knife crime.\nSimmons, who was being questioned by MPs on the cross-party education select committee, said the aim of having more officers in schools was to develop better relationships and improve engagement between young people and the police.\nRosenberg said: \u201cIt is of obvious importance that the Met understands, monitors and addresses the equality implications of deploying police officers in schools. It simply cannot be done without the collection and analysis of relevant data.\n\u201cThe Metropolitan police has not done that in relation to its use of safer schools officers, and this is what we hope will be addressed as part of the judicial review.\u201d\nA police spokesman said: \u201cThe Met is defending a judicial review claim brought in March 2020, relating to the Met\u2019s safer schools project. It would be inappropriate to comment further while proceedings are ongoing.\u201d",

        "content": "Left in charge of the UK\u2019s front-of-house, the foreign secretary struggled with basic hygiene at the daily press briefing\nCast your mind back to the Tory leadership contest last June. Back then, Dominic Raab was voted out even before the last five Undateables of Boris Johnson, Jeremy Hunt, Michael Gove, Sajid Javid and Rory Stewart got to appear in a live televised debate. This means Conservative MPs considered Raab to be a worse option than both someone as pathologically untrustworthy as the Govester, and a man, in Stewart, who would soon not even be a member of the party.\nNow take a deep breath, preferably not within two metres of a stranger: with Boris Johnson and Matt Hancock temporarily out of action, Raab has been the de facto leader of the country for the last five days. Or at least the politician tasked with doing all the front-of-house prime ministerial stuff. Not that we would have necessarily known, as no one can recall having seen the foreign secretary in person for more than a week. Rumour has it he had yet more unfinished body-disposal business to take care of first. Having a stand-in prime minister that looks like the serial killer in every Netflix miniseries is not altogether reassuring.\nYet we are where we are, and shortly after 5pm, Raab, flanked by the UK\u2019s chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, and the medical director for Public Health England, Yvonne Doyle, took centre stage for the daily Downing Street press conference. Complete with a new logo, on lecterns that looked like they had been knocked up out of police crime-scene tape. Presumably, Dom has picked up plenty of rolls on his travels.\nHe did not get off to the best of starts. Just as Raab was going through the daily checklists of things not to do to spread the coronavirus, he repeatedly licked his fingers. The bloke who was doing the sign-language service for the BBC looked as if he was about to have a meltdown.\nRaab\u2019s main message, delivered in a deliberate \u2013 if slightly sweaty \u2013 monotone, was about the help he was planning to provide for Brits stranded abroad. While promising to do his best to repatriate everyone who was unable to get flights home, he managed to imply that most of those stuck in South America, Morocco and Cyprus had been dawdling on the beach to get the best of the winter sun and had failed to follow the spread of the pandemic on the news. It didn\u2019t quite square with reports of frantic tourists stuck abroad who had found their flights had been cancelled. But better late than never, I suppose.\nNeither were Vallance\u2019s efforts to talk us through the science and the effects of the lockdown altogether successful \u2013 though the fault lay entirely with the IT team, rather than the chief scientific adviser. \u201cCan we have the next slide please?\u201d he snapped, somewhat impatiently. Which was the first that any of us knew he had actually been referring to previous slides up to this point, as none had appeared on screen. After that, we were rather playing catch-up. We were doing better than Italy and Spain, he observed, trying to be upbeat \u2013 something that clearly doesn\u2019t come naturally to him \u2013 and were about on a par with France. He didn\u2019t explain why Germany and South Korea were so far ahead of us in reducing their mortality rates.\nThe questions from the media tried to pin things down a little, but Raab hasn\u2019t spent years evading police custody without becoming a past master of the evasive answer. He couldn\u2019t say if we were doing the right or wrong number of tests, and failed to explain why the UK had initially adopted a policy of coronavirus \u201cno big deal\u201d appeasement, which was why we were now right at the back of the queue for many of the medical supplies we needed.\nRaab was quick to support the police, however, in their attempts to enforce the partial lockdown. After all, if they were busy stopping people from buying Easter eggs, then they wouldn\u2019t be out and about investigating more serious crimes. He remained ambivalent about the idea that Brexiter death-cult libertarians should be allowed to do what they want, providing they wore a badge saying: \u201cIn the event of me or one of my relatives contracting the virus, we wish to refuse all hospital treatment.\u201d\nThe foreign secretary did, though, hint at a possible reckoning with China once the pandemic was over. Quite what shape that might take was left unsaid, though the Brexit party chairman, Richard Tice, was well ahead of him on this. He had made it clear he would decline any second-rate Chinese medical equipment, and would only accept ventilators that were British-made. Why else had we left the EU? Now was the time to take back control. Of our own deaths.\nHalfway through a sentence, Raab abruptly ended the press conference and headed for the exit. Perhaps no foreign secretary was better than a bad foreign secretary. There were so many surfaces to touch, fingers to lick. And he didn\u2019t know when his next chance might come.",

The government and its scientific advisers deny that was ever their strategy.\nLast week, Downing Street rejected as \u201ca highly defamatory fabrication\u201d a claim that Cummings initially argued against strict measures to contain coronavirus in a view summarised as \u201cif that means some pensioners die, too bad\u201d.\nThe former special adviser to Michael Gove and Vote Leave campaign director will now have to spend at least a week in quarantine, according to Public Health England guidelines.\nHis absence from the centre of government comes as former senior civil servants with emergency planning experience were drafted in to No 10 to help with the government\u2019s response.\nDowning Street said that ex-senior civil servants have been asked to return to Whitehall as the government seeks to coordinate its response to the virus. \u201cIn No 10 and across government we have put in place contingency plans to ensure we can carry on working throughout this outbreak and to ensure we have all the capacity we need to lead the nationwide response,\u201d Johnson\u2019s spokesman said.\nA Whitehall source said there has been a \u201clong-term problem\u201d with staff retention in the senior civil service. \u201cStaff shortages and absences through illness have led to a lack of experienced hands,\u201d the source said.\nIn a further development, the government announced that an experienced mandarin, Alex Chisholm, has been appointed second-in-command of the British civil service and given the task of overseeing Johnson\u2019s reforms.\nCivil service reform has been a key objective of Cummings, who believes Whitehall is responsible for many policy failures. In a blog post earlier this year, Cummings called for \u201cweirdos and misfits\u201d to join the civil service but his approach backfired when one new contractor, Andrew Sabisky, soon quit after controversial previous comments over eugenics were unearthed.\nChisholm, 52, will succeed John Manzoni, who was chief executive of the civil service and permanent secretary at the Cabinet Office, and will take the title of chief operating officer.\nJohnson tested positive on Friday for coronavirus and is self-isolating in Downing Street. He said he had experienced mild symptoms over the previous 24 hours, including a temperature and cough, but continues to lead the government.\nMatt Hancock, the health secretary, said he had also tested positive, while England\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, has shown symptoms.\nThe government has faced criticism from public health experts for failing to heed its own advice to the public on how to contain the coronavirus through physical distancing.\nThe Scotland secretary, Alister Jack, who sat between Johnson and Hancock at prime minister\u2019s questions on Wednesday, confirmed at the weekend that he had a cough and a temperature \u2013 common symptoms of coronavirus \u2013 and would remain at home, making him the third cabinet minister to go into self isolation.\nParliament has now closed for four weeks as the start of the planned Easter recess was brought forward because of concerns about the spread of the virus. MPs and peers will not return until 21 April at the earliest and even then it night not be business as usual.\nThe Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, said that \u201cvirtual parliament and virtual select committees\u201d could be a possibility as he announced the extended recess on Wednesday evening.",

An extension of the transition period is the only responsible thing to do.\u201d\nDavid McAllister, the German MEP who leads the European parliament\u2019s work on the future relationship with the UK, said the pandemic complicated an \u201calready very ambitious\u201d schedule. \u201cThe ball is now clearly in the British court,\u201d he added.\nUnder the withdrawal agreement, the Brexit transition period ends on 31 December 2020, terminating British membership of the EU single market and customs union. But it can be extended for one or two years if both sides agree by 1 July.\nThe EU has made little secret it would back any extension request, but the British government continues to rule that out.\nResponding to the EPP statement, a UK government spokesperson said: \u201cThe transition period ends on 31 December 2020, as enshrined in UK law, which the prime minister has made clear he has no intention of changing.\u201d\nThe plea for extra time comes as British and EU politicians prepared to hold their first meeting to discuss putting in place the Irish Sea border. The Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, was due to hold a conference call with the European commission\u2019s vice-president, Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d, on Monday to discuss how to implement the agreement on the Irish border. The pair were also due to discuss citizens\u2019 rights, amid concern from campaigners that the coronavirus crisis would make it harder for European Union nationals in the UK to secure their status.\nFollowing the meeting, the two sides issued separate statements and each described talks as \u201cconstructive\u201d. However, the EU struck a more insistent tone, saying there was an \u201curgent need\u201d for a timetable on putting into place customs procedures and animal health checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain.\nEU officials have been alarmed by repeated statements from the prime minister that there will not be controls on goods crossing this internal UK border \u2013 a statement that contradicts what he agreed in the withdrawal agreement.\nThe British government stated it was committed \u201cto upholding our obligations under the Northern Ireland protocol\u201d.\nThe latest talks were not intended to touch on the future relationship, amid rising doubts about the prospects for agreeing an unprecedented deal spanning trade, security and fishing rights by the end of the year.\nBritish and EU negotiators had concluded only three and a half days of formal talks before the coronavirus struck Europe heavily. A second round due to be held in London earlier this month was scrapped, while next week\u2019s talks seem unlikely to go ahead, despite previous hopes of running them by video conference.\nBritish officials say they continue to explore video-conferencing. But it\u2019s not a simple fix. At least 10 to 20 people can take part in just one thematic topic for each side, making virtual talks complicated to organise when individuals are working from home. Talks may cover about 10 different themes.\nThe EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has the virus, while his UK opposite number, David Frost, has symptoms and has gone into self-isolation. Officials on both sides say they are in regular contact.",

But the governor, Andrew Cuomo, warned on Monday that his state was a harbinger of what\u2019s to come across the country.\n\u201cI don\u2019t care if you live in Kansas. I don\u2019t care if you live in Texas. There is no American that is immune. What is happening to New York is not an anomaly,\u201d Cuomo said at a press briefing.\n\u201cAnyone who says this is a New York City-only situation is in a state of denial.\u201d\nCuomo hit back at Donald Trump\u2019s repeated assertion that the state has exaggerated its need for life-saving medical equipment.\nThe governor said on MSNBC on Monday morning: \u201cThe science people, the government professionals have to stand up and look the president in the eye and say this is not a political exercise. This is not press relations. It\u2019s not optics. The tsunami is coming.\u201d\nAs the US\u2019s top doctors say the virus could kill as many as 200,000 Americans, Cuomo and the New York City mayor, Bill de Blasio have instituted increasingly stringent policies.\nFor more than a week now, non-essential employees have been obliged to work from home, schools have been closed and a normally bustling city has gone eerily quiet.\nThis weekend, after Trump floated an enforced quarantine for New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a travel advisory urging residents to avoid non-essential travel for two weeks. Cuomo said New York would stay effectively shuttered at least until 15 April.\nState and local officials are scrambling to drum up staff and supplies to get them through the apex of the outbreak, which is predicted for the near future. A temporary hospital for overflow patients at midtown Manhattan\u2019s Jacob K Javits Convention Center opened on Monday, the first in a series of facilities being constructed. The USNS Comfort, a navy hospital ship, will help hospitals deal with non-coronavirus patients.\n\u201cMy message to the president is thank you, and we need more help,\u201d De Blasio said after welcoming the ship.\nIn Central Park\u2019s East Meadow, an unfamiliar cluster of tents cropped up on Sunday as the Mount Sinai health system and a humanitarian aid organization, Samaritan\u2019s Purse, erected a 68-bed field hospital which De Blasio said would be operational by Tuesday.\n\u201cThis is the kind of thing you will see now as this crisis develops and deepens,\u201d the mayor said.\nCuomo has said the state will probably need 140,000 hospital beds to deal with the pandemic, far more than the 53,000 beds it supports under normal circumstances. Cuomo has mandated that hospitals increase capacity by 50% and is considering using hotels, college dormitories, nursing homes and other facilities.\nLeaders have also urgently emphasized their need for ventilators, which can make the difference between life and death for some critically ill patients. Trump has continually downplayed their requests.\nCuomo has said that New York will need 30,000 ventilators once the crisis peaks. De Blasio estimates New York City alone will need 15,000 ventilators.\nOn Thursday night, Trump commented: \u201cI don\u2019t believe you need 40,000 or 30,000 ventilators. You go into major hospitals sometimes, and they\u2019ll have two ventilators. And now all of a sudden they\u2019re saying, \u2018Can we order 30,000 ventilators?\u2019\u201d\nTensions have escalated even further as Trump suggested New York wasn\u2019t distributing the equipment it already had, an allegation Cuomo said \u201cdefies the basic concept of planning\u201d.\n\u201cIt is a fundamental blunder to only prepare for today,\u201d Cuomo said Monday. \u201cThat\u2019s why, in some ways, we are where we are. We\u2019ve been behind this virus from day one.\u201d\nNew York and Washington have also sparred over federal aid, as the state expects a $10-15bn revenue loss because of Covid-19. On Sunday, De Blasio said he had spoken to the New York senator Chuck Schumer and the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, about the need for an April stimulus package \u201cto provide real and immediate relief to New York City and New York state\u201d.\n\u201cThe Congress, the president have to act to keep New York City and New York state whole,\u201d De Blasio said. \u201cIt\u2019s the right thing to do morally. It\u2019s the right thing to do to protect people.\u201d",

Others had been offered remote support but were concerned about privacy, access to technology or felt anxious about speaking on the phone or via video calls.\nWhen the charity asked respondents what had impacted their mental health the most, the loss of routine and social isolation were the most commonly cited factors.\nEmma Thomas, the chief executive of YoungMinds, said the pandemic was a \u201chuman tragedy that will continue to alter the lives of everyone in our society. The results of this survey show just how big an impact this has had, and will continue to have, on the mental health of young people.\u201d\nTom Madders, the director of campaigns at YoungMinds, said: \u201cAlthough respondents support and understood the steps the government has taken to restrict movement, certain activities and routines were important coping mechanisms for many of them. Without them, some were concerned that they were more likely to use negative coping strategies.\u201d\nMadders also suggested that maintaining a connection with family and friends, even through social media, could be beneficial but social media access should be controlled.\n\u201cSocial media is a great way to stay in touch with friends,\u201d he said, \u201cbut can also induce anxiety, especially if your feed includes constant news updates. It\u2019s important that young people know that they can control their feed by unfollowing or muting the accounts that might make them feel worse.\u201d\nJacob, 22, a YoungMinds activist, said his panic attacks had returned for the first time in three years and he had also had difficulty sleeping and eating. \u201cMy counsellor is continuing my weekly sessions online and it\u2019s invaluable to have that time to talk through my anxieties and help me rationalise them,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI\u2019m talking to my friends and family about how I\u2019m feeling which is helping and also limiting the amount of news I watch or read, and baking or being creative instead.\u201d",

The countries were chosen because they are large developing country markets, spread across three continents.\nThe sachets, bottles, and cartons sold in these countries often end up either being burned or dumped \u2013 creating a pollution problem equivalent to covering 83 football pitches with plastic to 10 centimetres deep each day.\nThe report says: \u201cThis massive plastic pollution footprint, while a crisis in and of itself, is also contributing to the climate crisis.\u201d\nIt adds that the four companies make little or no mention of emissions from disposal of their products or packaging in their climate change commitments.\n\u201cThese companies continue to sell billions of products in single-use bottles, sachets and packets in developing countries,\u201d says the report.\n\u201cAnd they do this despite knowing that: waste isn\u2019t properly managed in these contexts; their packaging therefore becomes pollution; and such pollution causes serious harm to the environment and people\u2019s health. Such actions \u2013 with such knowledge \u2013 are morally indefensible.\u201d\nThe charity is calling for the companies to urgently switch to refillable and reusable packaging instead of sachets and plastic bottles.\nThe NGO estimated how much of their plastic waste in each country is mismanaged, burned or dumped using World Bank data.\nTheir analysis of emissions quantities were calculated by estimating the proportion of each company\u2019s mismanaged plastic that is openly burned, and combining these amounts with emissions factors for three different types of plastic. Their analysis was independently reviewed.\nThe research found that emissions produced from the open burning of Coca-Cola, Nestl\u00e9, PepsiCo and Unilever\u2019s plastic packaging on street corners, open dumps and in backyards in developing countries was a major contribution to the climate emergency.\nCoca-Cola creates the biggest plastic pollution footprint in the six countries. The drinks giant creates 200,000 tonnes of plastic waste \u2013 or about 8bn bottles \u2013 which is burned or dumped each year in the six countries: enough to cover 33 football pitches every day.\nPepsiCo creates 137,000 tonnes of plastic pollution per year \u2013 equivalent to covering 22 football pitches a day.\nNestl\u00e9 leaves a pollution footprint of 95,000 tonnes per year or covering 15 football pitches a day.\nUnilever\u2019s pollution footprint amounts to 70,000 tonnes per year \u2013 covering more than 11 football pitches a day.\nGlobal plastic production is increasing, and is set to double over the next 10 to 15 years creating plastic pollution, increased carbon emissions and deadly health impacts for people in the poorest nations.\nThe report highlighted how communities in low- and middle-income countries continue to be swamped by mismanaged waste, including plastic pollution, that causes environmental destruction, sickness and death.\nDr Ruth Valerio, the director of global advocacy and influencing at Tearfund, said: \u201cThese companies are selling plastic in the full knowledge that it will be burned or dumped in developing countries: scarring landscapes, contributing to climate change and harming the health of the world\u2019s poorest people.\n\u201cCoca-Cola, Nestl\u00e9, PepsiCo and Unilever make little or no mention of emissions from the disposal of their products or packaging in their climate change commitments. These companies have a moral responsibility for the disposal of the products they continue to pump into developing countries without proper waste management systems.\u201d\nThe report says examples of multinational companies adopting reusable and refillable delivery mechanisms in developing countries were still few and far between.\nPositive cases included Unilever\u2019s use of a mobile dispensing delivery system run by Chilean social enterprise group Algramo to offer refills to customers in Chile, and the scaling-up of returnable Coca-Cola PET bottles in Brazil.\n\u201cThese examples show moving to refill and reuse models is possible \u2026 there are decision-makers in companies who are willing to think outside the (single-use plastic) box,\u201d the report said.\nTearfund is calling on the companies to dramatically reduce the production and sale of single-use plastic packaging and switch to refillable and reusable models.\nThe NGO is demanding the companies:\nReport the number of units of single-use plastic products they use and sell in each country by the end of this year.\nReduce this amount by half, country by country, by 2025, and instead use environmentally sustainable delivery methods such as refillable or reusable containers.\nRecycle the single-use plastics they sell in developing countries, ensuring that by 2022 one is collected for every one sold.\nRestore dignity through working in partnership with waste pickers to create safe jobs.\nA spokesperson for Nestl\u00e9 said: \u201cWe have set ourselves the commitment to make 100% of our packaging recyclable or reusable by 2025. We are working hard to eliminate non-recyclable plastics and invest in innovative, alternative delivery systems, including bulk, reuse and refill options.\u201d\nA spokesperson for Unilever said: \u201cWe\u2019ve committed to halve our use of virgin plastic in our packaging in just five years and reduce our total use of plastic by more than 100,000 tonnes. This demands a fundamental rethink in our approach to packaging and products, and as we speak, we\u2019re piloting different reuse and refill formats across the world, so we can test, learn and scale these solutions.\u201d\nA PepsiCo spokesperson said: \u201cWe are working to reduce the amount of plastic we use and have set a target to, by 2025, decrease virgin plastic content across our beverage business by 35 per cent. Between July 2018 and 2019 we pledged over $51m to global partnerships designed to boost recycling rates to support a circular economy.\u201d\nA Coca-Cola spokesperson, said: \u201cWe are absolutely committed to ensuring the packaging in which we serve our products is sustainable and our efforts are focused on continuing to improve the eco-design and innovation of our packaging. As part of a number of global commitments, we have committed to getting every bottle back for each one sold by 2030, with the aim to ensure that every plastic bottle contains at least 50% recycled plastic by 2030.\u201d\nRoyda Joseph is 32. She has three children and lives with her family in a community situated next to the Pugu Kinyamwezi rubbish dump in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.\nHer and her family\u2019s lives are blighted by the impact of pollution from the dump. It is frequently on fire, and dust and litter spreads through the community, attracting huge amounts of flies.\nBetween 400,000 and a million people die every year in low- and middle-income countries because of diseases related to plastic and other mismanaged waste.\nJoseph said the impact of the burning of waste was felt by her family every day. \u201cThe dump is on fire every two days,\u201d she said.\n\u201cSometimes, when it is on fire, the smoke is so dark and huge that you can\u2019t see the person in front of you or the house next to you. Because of that smoke I get breathing problems and coughing, and eye problems too. The kids also get a lot of breathing problems: they cough a lot. When it is really bad, there is no way that you can deal with it without going to the hospital.\n\u201cThe smoke and the fire come when the weather is very dry and the gases are coming out of the fire \u2026 when the dump is on fire, it can take one to two hours until they call the fire brigade to come here and try to stop it. It is that bad. Sometimes it can take two to three hours because of the traffic.\u201d\nAt times Joseph has to leave her home because of the density of the smoke.\n\u201cMany times when the dump is on fire and really bad, when the smoke is so heavy, I shift to my relatives for a time,\u201d she said.\nJoseph is concerned for her children\u2019s future. \u201cI am worried about my children\u2019s health because always when it is very dry, the smoke always comes,\u201d she said. \u201cI am sure in the long run they will develop health complications.\u201d",

For many, this means they can no longer work. Parents urgently need paid parental leave and protection from losing their jobs during this exceptional time.\u201d\nIn addition, the IPPR is calling for a \u00a310-a-week increase in the child element of universal credit and child tax credit, plus the scrapping of the two-child limit and the current benefit cap to boost family income by \u00a31,400 a year on average.\nIt also calls for a one-off emergency \u00a330 child benefit payment for 12.7 million children, plus an additional \u00a35 per week for each child, and suggests children should be given priority use of public parks and other private green spaces to enable them to enjoy the outdoors safely during the lockdown.\nThe IPPR director, Carys Roberts, said: \u201cIt\u2019s crucial that the government ensure that the poverty, educational and health gaps we and our children already face are not widened further by our response to the pandemic.\n\u201cIt\u2019s especially important that policymakers do not overlook the impact of the measures on a generation of the UK\u2019s children, who have least voice in what\u2019s happening but will live with the consequences of our decisions for decades to come.\u201d\nKathy Evans, the chief executive of Children England, added: \u201cDespite the welcome measures so far announced, worsening household poverty and social isolation risk being a major threat to children\u2019s and families\u2019 health and safety, and to their prospects of recovery from the social and economic impacts of this pandemic.\u201d\nThe Department for Education was approached for comment.",

        "content": "Health minister Greg Hunt says private hospitals must retain staff during coronavirus pandemic, since the state is underwriting their viability\nTens of thousands of doctors, nurses and midwives from Australia\u2019s private hospitals will be made available for redeployment within the public health system, as part of a package designed to prop up the sector and tackle the coronavirus pandemic.\nThe federal government will wear half of the cost of integrating the private hospital system with the public one in preparation for Covid-19, the health minister, Greg Hunt, has said in a letter to the private health sector guaranteeing its viability.\nHunt told reporters on Tuesday he expected the deal \u2013 a \u201conce-in-a-century redesign\u201d of the country\u2019s hospital services \u2013 to cost the federal government an extra $1.3bn, although the amount was uncapped and would be increased if needed.\nPrivate hospitals would support the Covid-19 response through activities such as providing care for public patients, carrying out category 1 elective surgery, and providing wards and theatres to expand ICU capacity.\nPrivate hospitals might also provide accommodation for quarantine and isolation cases where safety procedures are put in place, including passengers from cruise ships, according to a statement issued by Hunt.\nState and territory governments are expected to complete partnership agreements over the course of this week. In his letter, Hunt said those agreements would outline an integration plan, and that the federal government would contribute 50% of the funding required for this. On Saturday, the private sector warned that hundreds of staff would need to be stood down and hospitals closed following elective surgery cancellations to prioritise Covid-19 preparedness.\nThe plans follow a meeting on Monday between the private health sector and the federal, state and territory governments to discuss how private hospitals and staff will be supported following elective surgery cancellations and until the sector is needed to assist with the coronavirus response, as well as how the sector will be used as the pandemic worsens to prevent the public sector from becoming overwhelmed.\n\u201cThe Australian public needs to have confidence that deferred activities, such as non-urgent elective surgery, will be able to be resumed and accelerated at the appropriate time,\u201d Hunt\u2019s letter to private health providers, published on the ASX on Tuesday by Ramsay Health, said.\n\u201cAs the Australian government is underwriting your viability, you must retain the workforce for operation in your own facility or for redeployment across the health system or as directed by the government or states and territories including medical, nursing, clinical and ancillary staff. The Australian government will work quickly to ensure your staff have appropriate training and equipment to ensure patient care is safe and the health and safety of your staff is maintained.\u201d\nHunt wrote that the agreement was only to ensure the viability of the sector, and its purpose was not to generate profit or to assist with loan or debt repayment. The viability guarantee would be conditional on the hospitals agreeing to open their books to show government funding was only being used for operational costs.\nHe said the sector must agree to support the aged care sector and national disability insurance scheme recipients in return and must make its equipment, such as personal protective gear, available to the broader workforce.\nFailure of the private sector to follow directions from the state and territory governments to integrate with the public sector would lead to the agreement being voided, Hunt said.\nEconomists and health analysts warned on Monday that the private sector should not be given special treatment ahead of other businesses and sectors facing unemployment and profit losses. Speaking about the deal at a press conference on Tuesday afternoon, Hunt said the partnership would add 30,000 beds to the hospital system.\n\u201cIt will bring over 105,000 full- and part-time hospital staff, including 57,000 of our amazing nurses and midwives,\u201d he said. \u201cIt guarantees them their future and their support, both during the crisis and beyond, but most importantly it brings their resources to the fight against coronavirus, Covid-19, in Australia.\u201d\nGrattan Institute health economist Stephen Duckett said he did not see why hospitals should be receiving government support to pay for overheads while they were empty, but that the government seemed to have put tight measures in place to ensure bailout money was used as wisely as possible.\n\u201cThe federal government is at least trying to be tight and they make it clear this money is only for specific purposes.\u201d\nThe chair of the Australian Healthcare Reform Alliance, Jennifer Doggett, said the terms of the agreement were sensible as they ensured the resources in the private hospital sector would be used wisely.\n\u201cIt also recognises the reliance of the so-called \u2018private\u2019 hospital sector on public funding,\u201d Doggett said. \u201cThe public invests billions each year into this sector - doctors and nurses are trained through publicly funded universities and in public hospitals, Medicare funds 75% of the schedule fee for services provided to private patients and the private health insurance rebate which subsidises the cost of private hospital insurance. These subsidies can only be justified if they deliver public benefits.\n\u201cHowever, post-pandemic, this agreement should prompt a rethink of the role of the private hospital sector in Australia, in particular the role of \u2018for profit\u2019 providers such as Ramsay and Healthscope. The transformation of the private hospital sector in Australia from mostly locally-based, not-for-profit industry to one dominated by large for-profit corporate entities, many of whom are based overseas, has occurred without any substantial policy oversight or public debate. It has been driven by commercial and corporate interests rather than by the health needs of the community.\u201d",

But photos of the temporary shelter showing people sleeping close to each other on the ground, some within arm\u2019s reach, sparked backlash on social media.\nJace Radke, spokesperson for the city of Las Vegas, said the city and county had worked to open the temporary shelter after Catholic Charities closed and the city\u2019s other shelter, Courtyard Homeless Resource Center, was nearly filled to capacity.\nOfficials set up the new shelter in the parking lot of the Cashman Center, which most recently has hosted soccer games. A city official said the inside of the Cashman Center could not be used as shelter because it was reserved for overflow hospital space.\nHomelessness is a continuing crisis in southern Nevada, with at least 6,500 people camped on streets or in storm drains at any given time.\nOn Saturday, roughly a dozen medical and physician assistant students from Touro University were on hand to help officials set up the shelter.\nTouro University med students & physician asst. students have arrived to help with our temp. homeless facility at Cashman Center.

People are always going to criticize. But the city and county are working to ensure people can get the resources they need,\u201d he said, adding that the state\u2019s stay-at-home order \u201cis easier said than done for people who are homeless\u201d.\nDespite the backlash, the shelter was a welcome sight to Denise Lankford, who is unhoused.\n\u201cI\u2019m about to cry,\u201d Lankford told the CNN affiliate KLAS. \u201cThis right here is helping us feel secure, feel safe. Other places, you don\u2019t feel safe.\u201d\nBefore coronavirus landed in the global spotlight, the city had begun cracking down on people living outdoors. In November, the city council approved a law that made sitting, resting or \u201clodging\u201d on sidewalks a misdemeanor punishable with up to six months in jail or fines of up to $1,000 in most neighborhoods.\nWhile the mayor, Carolyn Goodman, said the city\u2019s \u201centire effort is humanitarian and compassionate\u201d, housing advocates worried that the \u201cno lodging\u201d convictions would haunt people for the rest of their lives.\nHomelessness is a widespread problem across the western US, particularly in California, where more than 40,000 people live in shelters on a given night.\nAdvocates and shelter residents have warned that unsanitary and inhumane conditions raise significant concerns for the battle against the spread of the coronavirus.",

They claimed:\nPolice in Italy have been handing fines to homeless people, prompting the Italian Federation of Organisations for Homeless People to write to the interior ministry appealing for leniency: \u201cThey cannot stay at home because they do not have a home,\u201d the federation said. \u201cIt has happened in different cities\u201d, said Michele Ferraris, the federation\u2019s spokesman. \u201cThere is an economic sanction which they cannot pay, and they have to go to the magistrate. They are not on the street for fun.\u201d\nRough sleepers and families living in temporary accommodation, including children, were not able to get enough food. \u201cNormally in Brussels you don\u2019t have people starving, people can find food, but now even that is a problem for people on the street\u201d, said Mauro Striano, a policy officer for a Brussels-based NGO, the European Federation of National Associations Working with the Homeless. Laura Slimani from the Federation of Solidarity Actors in France said: \u201cFood aid is in a problematic situation [in Paris] because of the lack of protective material [for social workers at food banks and day centres]. Last week and until now it is one the big problems.\u201d\nPanicked social workers in Prague were being forced to sew together masks and gloves from scrap material due to the lack of protective equipment. \u201cThere is nothing,\u201d said Stepan Ripka, from the Czech NGO Platform for Social Housing. \u201cPeople have been sewing textile protections together at their home. Once we have the first positive case in the social services it will be a big problem, because people will want to look after themselves\u201d.\nThe coronavirus pandemic has hit Europe at a time when record numbers of people are living without a home. There are an estimated 700,000 people on the streets or in shelters on any given night in the EU and the UK, up 70% from a decade ago, and the figures are still on the rise in every country apart from Finland.\nThe European commissioner for jobs and social rights, Nicolas Schmit, told the Guardian that the fragile state of the system had shown that the policy of economic austerity in the wake of the 2007 financial crisis failed Europe.\nSchmit, a former minister in Luxembourg, appealed to governments during recent meetings of ministers to use EU funds avoid more deaths among the most vulnerable.\n\u201cLiving on the street has a huge impact on mental as well as physical health \u2013 the homeless are therefore particularly at risk\u201d, the commissioner said. \u201cThey often already have pathologies and therefore are considered to be more vulnerable. The coronavirus will also affect those who accompany the homeless. It is important that the workers are protected too.\u201d\nSchmit added: \u201cI say austerity has failed. Austerity has created a lot of social failures, but also social scars in our society\u2026 I think of the idea of cutting back on the welfare state, cutting back all the time on public expenditure, the idea that housing can be just resolved by the market. Well, this has not worked.\u201d\nRuth Owen, the deputy director at the European Federation of National Associations Working with the Homeless, said there had been positive moves in recent days in London, Paris, Prague, Barcelona and elsewhere in the requisitioning of hotels, holiday homes and Airbnb properties for homeless people.\nBut she claimed that a major obstacle lay in separating the healthy from those infected but not showing symptoms. Social workers in Belgium claimed the homeless were being divided based simply on the hint of a cough.\nOwen said: \u201cWe need targeted outreach in testing for homeless people because they are a particularly vulnerable group, less able to protect themselves and more likely to get sick and die.\n\u201cMost of the settings where homeless people can be safely housed are quite dangerous places at the moment if you are not able to separate those infected and not infected.\u201d\n\u201cWe are also calling for protected gear for people working in the homeless sector, and for homeless services to be considered as essential services,\u201d Owen said. \u201cThe food supply is also threatened by the lockdown conditions and there is a big issue of volunteers and staff to provide those services.\u201d",

        "content": "Number of cases may far exceed official figures amid claims of quarantining by non-state actors\nHealth and other officials focused on Lebanon, Iraq and Syria fear the numbers of people infected with coronavirus far exceed the official figures disclosed by all three governments, and claim non-state actors are quarantining entire communities of patients in areas outside state control.\nOfficials, including bureaucrats, aid workers and international observers, who spoke with the Guardian over the past week say parts of Lebanon and Iraq in particular are likely to be holding thousands more infected people, and that a lack of disclosure poses a serious health risk over the next three months.\nThey also claim coronavirus patients are being housed and guarded by political groups in central and southern Iraq and southern Lebanon.\nAn even worse scenario is thought to be unfolding in Syria, where weak state structures, an internally displaced population of 7 million, and the fact large chunks of the country remainoutside central government control make controlling the spread of the virus almost impossible.\nGround and air links between all three countries have been largely severed, but there are deepening concerns that large numbers of virus carriers were able to return before borders were sealed in mid-March.\nReturnees to Lebanon had arrived from all over the world, with a priest travelling from Italy thought to be responsible for one cluster, and travellers from Milan and London for others. However, the focus of concern has been on arrivals from the Iranian city of Qom, to where the biggest regional outbreak has been sourced.\nLarge numbers of Iraqi and Lebanese people, including religious pilgrims and merchants, had been in Qom as the crisis escalated and were gradually brought back by bus and plane to Baghdad and Beirut, where only small numbers of patients from their communities are being treated in public hospitals.\nThe leader of Hezbollah, the powerful political bloc-cum-militia, in Lebanon, Hassan Nasrallah, has said its returning members have been placed in quarantine and has vowed to be transparent about infections.\nHowever, so far there have been no announcements from the group about the numbers of suspected or confirmed cases, and concerns are mounting that Lebanon\u2019s relatively low official number of cases \u2013 412 as of Sunday night \u2013 is actually much higher.\nThe spectre of a parallel health structure dealing with its own casualties has caused alarm among serving and former health officials, who say the central government should have access to patient data and be responsible for treatment.\n\u201cWe are not saying this to make a problem for a certain political party, or area of the country,\u201d said one official who, like all others spoken with, refused to be named. \u201cBut we know there is a much bigger problem in Lebanon than has been acknowledged.\u201d\nSimilarly, the official Iraqi number of 547 has been widely challenged both inside the country and around the region. \u201cPeople are dying in their homes with this disease across the country and being buried without authorities acknowledging what killed them. The numbers, and the areas of infection, need to be truly understood or else efforts to stop the pandemic elsewhere may be sabotaged.\u201d\nIn Lebanon, a second official claimed that over recent weeks Hezbollah had quarantined areas in many towns in the south of the country and provided food and water to suspected patients. The neighbourhoods were guarded by party members, the official claimed.\nLast week, a senior member of the Hezbollah Executive Council, Hashem Safieddine, said the party had 25,000 medics whom it had mobilised to treat patients. He said the party had placed 1,500 doctors and 3,000 nurses in public hospitals and was preparing empty hotels to be used as isolation areas. The party said it was monitoring 1,200 people who had returned from Iran. It did not say whether any were showing symptoms of the virus.\nCouncil officials and Hezbollah members in southern Lebanon released photographs during the week of fabricated houses and large blue tent they said were to be designated as quarantine or treatment centres for future cases. On Tuesday, the party plans to showcase its preparations during a media tour in its stronghold area in Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs.\n\u201cWhat they didn\u2019t say is that these facilities are needed right now,\u201d said one of the officials. \u201cThis isn\u2019t future planning, it\u2019s dealing with a critical real-time need. The public needs to know that, and so do people formulating a global response. What happens here matters outside the country.\u201d\nTwo months into the pandemic, the number of cases across the Middle East continues to steadily rise. More testing in the past week is thought to account for a sharp increase in recent days. Lebanon\u2019s testing had been at the lower end of the regional scale at 150-200 tests a day, but has increased since mid-week. Gulf Arab states have been testing more extensively, with Bahrain at close to 32,000 tests, Qatar 16,700 and Kuwait about 27,000.\nA large number of those infections have been traced to Iran, and borders in all three states have been sealed and are set to remain so for at least the next fortnight.\nIn north-west Syria, the head of Idlib\u2019s health directorate, Dr Munzer al-Khalil, said: \u201cIn one year, we lost around 76 health facilities. Donors have cut their funds and medical staff have been killed, arrested or displaced. The health sector in Idlib cannot cope with the inevitable outbreak and we fear 100,000 people could die unless we get supplies immediately.\n\u201cOur ventilators are always 100% occupied and we don\u2019t have one single bed ready for a coronavirus case today. Camps are the perfect breeding ground for the virus and [we are] 400% over capacity, with 10 or more people sharing one tent.\u201d\n This article was amended on 1 April 2020 to correct the name of Hashem Safieddine.",

Any you don\u2019t think are relevant, don\u2019t allow. If the app won\u2019t let you use it without access to those functions, consider if it is worth it.\n\u201cOften default settings on these kinds of services may not be set with your privacy or security in mind, so it\u2019s important to adjust your settings accordingly to ensure your account is secure as possible,\u201d the eSafety commissioner, Julie Inman-Grant, said.\n\u201cWe also encourage users to read up on the terms and conditions of these services so they understand what kind of data is being collected about them and how it is being used, as well as the mechanism for reporting any abuse.\n\u201cThis will help you limit the amount of personal information being shared with the service or any third parties.\u201d\nYour attitude to the data being collected by these apps should be no different from when we aren\u2019t in the middle of a pandemic. It is always good practice to be vigilant.\nHouseparty is a video conferencing app designed more for non-business purposes. The app has been around for about four years but was picked up last year by Epic Games, the company behind the popular video game Fortnite.\nIts popularity has skyrocketed. It\u2019s been estimated that it has been downloaded several million times in the past few weeks as more people are stuck at home and want to socialise.\nCyber security researchers have suggested the app permissions it seeks are consistent with those from a video conferencing app. It accesses your microphone and camera if you give it permission, along with contacts and Facebook friends if you provide that.\nIn its privacy policy, Houseparty outlines the usual sort of data, the information you provide, plus the analytics data that is automatically collected. Houseparty also says it could use de-identified demographic and location information.\nThe other video conferencing platform that has a boost in popularity in the coronavirus pandemic is Zoom.\nSimilar to Houseparty it\u2019s important to check permissions, but Zoom has had a few privacy concerns in the past.\nThe meetings are public without passcodes, so people can \u201czoombomb\u201d on them if meetings use the default settings. And last year the company had a flaw that allowed hackers to hijack people\u2019s webcams through the app.\nThis week the company was also forced to fix its iOS app, which was sending data to Facebook even if you didn\u2019t connect via Facebook.\nA number of built-in features may also be a concern, including one that dobs on users not focused on the app for more than 30 seconds when a screen is being shared.\nThis week the federal government launched a new information app on iOS and Android which essentially mimics the information available on the health department website on symptom checker, number of cases, press releases and phone numbers.\nThe major bit of personal information it collects is that if you voluntarily register for self-isolation, it will ask for your location. Guardian Australia understands that information is only recorded at the time of registration or editing their information (not ongoing tracking) and is used by the government to figure out where those self-isolating are for analysis, research and safeguarding public health.\nOn WhatsApp, the chat developed by the government with the help of Atlassian is an automated service that just provides information. It\u2019s not a method of sharing information with the government, like the coronavirus app can be. The only personal information the government collects is your phone number.\nIf you are returning to Australia in the next couple of weeks and beyond, the federal government just made it easier for a wide range of state and federal agencies to get access to your movements.\nThrough new migration regulations home affairs has expanded the uses that can be made of information on passengers\u2019 movement records.\nThese records include citizenship, visa class, passport number, date of departure, flight number, intended place of disembarkation and ultimate destination.\nUnder the rules, state police forces can access the information for law enforcement and prevention of crime, and missing persons investigations.\nThe Office of National Intelligence will have access to the information for its own purposes and to help other agencies that are engaged in security vetting.\nThe Australian Electoral Commission will gain access for the purposes of \u201cthe review and processing of electors who appear to have failed to vote at an election\u201d.\nThe 2020 instrument also clarified that fair work ombudsman inspectors \u2013 who check for compliance with workplace laws \u2013 will gain access.\nState and federal privacy commissioners put out a statement this week that said privacy laws allowed various jurisdictions to share personal information at a time like this, but urged governments to conduct privacy impact assessments to ensure the handling of personal information is reasonable, necessary and proportionate.",

Abe did not discuss the measure in a phone call late on Monday with Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general of the World Health Organisation, according to the foreign ministry.\nJapan\u2019s economy minister, Yasutoshi Nishimura, warned that a lockdown of major cities such as Tokyo and Osaka would have a \u201chuge\u201d impact on the world\u2019s third-biggest economy. Nishimura said he did not believe Japan had reached the point where a state of emergency was necessary.\nBut the governor of Osaka, which has the second-highest number of cases nationwide, joined calls for a state of emergency declaration. \u201cThe central government has said Japan is barely holding up, so the declaration needs to be made,\u201d said Hirofumi Yoshimura. \u201cIf we leave it too late the virus will be uncontrollable.\u201d\nAs of Tuesday the coronavirus outbreak had infected 2,007 people in Japan with 59 deaths, according to the public broadcaster NHK. Those figures exclude 712 cases and 11 deaths from the Diamond Princess cruise liner which was quarantined in Yokohama in February.\nTokyo reported 13 new cases on Monday \u2013 compared with a record 68 the previous day \u2013 and a total of 443 infections, by far the most among Japan\u2019s 47 prefectures.\nJapan has tightened travel restrictions amid a rise in imported cases among travellers returning from overseas. On Tuesday the foreign ministry issued a \u201clevel 3\u201d advisory warning people to avoid travelling to 48 countries including the US, China, Britain, South Korea and Canada. The advisory applies to 73 countries and regions \u2013 roughly a third of the world.",

        "content": "The government has been working aggressively to try to prevent any shortfall of the life-saving machines\nA manufacturing industry leader and member of the government\u2019s ventilator taskforce says he is \u201cvery confident\u201d there will be enough of the life-saving machines to meet even the most dire of Covid-19 scenarios.\nThe Advanced Manufacturing Growth Centre managing director, Dr Jens Goennemann, is part of the team working with the federal government to boost ventilator numbers ahead of the pandemic\u2019s peak.\nThe worst-affected parts of the globe \u2013 Italy and the United States, most notably \u2013 have experienced serious shortages of ventilators, which are needed to assist the failing lungs of the most seriously ill Covid-19 patients.\nModelling released on Monday found Australia had the capacity to surge intensive care beds by 189%, if needed, but currently only had enough ventilators to partially meet that maximum surge capacity. The study recommended priority be given to boosting ventilator availability and increasing the health workforce needed to operate the machines.\nThe government has been working aggressively to try to prevent any shortfall in ventilator numbers, ramping up domestic production, procuring from abroad and converting existing equipment in preparation.\nIn an interview with the Guardian, Goennemann said Australia\u2019s strategy on ventilators had four main elements. They were:\nActivate the reserves. This includes drawing on existing equipment, including ventilators currently in veterinary clinics. A separate study in the Medical Journal of Australia found 188 invasive ventilators existed in 120 veterinary facilities, of which 179 were human model ventilators.\nPurchase from overseas via existing suppliers, including from German company Draeger, which specialises in breathing and protective equipment.\nPurchase from existing domestic manufacturers, most notably Melbourne-based company Resmed. An order has been placed for 1,000 new Resmed ventilators, and the company says it expects to double or triple its production.\nActivate additional domestic manufacturers. The AMGC is supporting a consortium of local manufacturers to adopt an existing ventilator design, owned by companies abroad, for onshore production.\nGoennemann, who has been helping government with projections of ventilator numbers, would not say how many new ventilators the strategy would yield.\nBut he said it would be enough to meet demand.\n\u201cI can tell you when I look at the current corona figures, I am very confident that the supply and availability of invasive ventilators will be higher than the necessity, even in dire scenarios,\u201d he said.\nThe AMGC, an industry-led not-for-profit, has been helping government and the local manufacturing sector identify existing businesses that could pivot into Covid-19-related work. That includes the manufacturing of personal protective equipment, hand sanitiser, and, in some cases, the more complex task of ventilator supply.\nModelling on ICU capacity released this week in the Medical Journal of Australia found there were currently 2,378 beds in 191 ICUs across Australia, about 9.4 beds per 100,000 population.\nThere was capacity to surge the number of ICU beds by an additional 4,261 (189%) if needed.\nThe study found an additional 2,361 invasive ventilators (120%) were available for such a surge, leaving \u201coverall insufficient availability of invasive ventilators within the hospitals of respondent ICUs to meet maximal bed surge\u201d.\nThe study used Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society (Anzics) registries data, supplemented by a surge capacity survey of ICUs and a survey of veterinary clinics.\nThe Anzics president, Dr Anthony Holley, has stated there was no current ventilator shortage and that Australia has significant ICU surge capacity.\nHolley said there was some potential for a temporary deficit of ventilators \u201cshould more surge beds be required\u201d.\nBut he said: \u201cA number of agencies, and most importantly the government, are working very aggressively to mitigate any potential shortfall.\u201d\nDeputy chief medical officer Dr Nick Coatsworth, who is leading the government\u2019s ventilator expansion program, said there were about 2,200 ventilated intensive care beds in Australia, only 20 of which were currently being used for Covid-19.\nCoatsworth said an immediate expansion can increase that number to 4,400.\n\u201cOur target capacity for ventilated intensive care beds in Australia currently stands at 7,500,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe are working around the clock to procure ventilators. I can tell you today that, locally, we will have 500 intensive care ventilators fabricated by ResMed, backed up by 5,000 non-invasive ventilators, with full delivery expected by the end of April.\u201d\nThe Australian Healthcare and Hospitals Association\u2019s chief executive, Alison Verhoeven, has also expressed confidence in Australia\u2019s planning for ventilator supply.\nVerhoeven said the challenge would be ensuring they were used in a way that covered as much of the population as possible, particularly in rural and regional areas.",

Created by composer and comedian Vikki Stone, #zoologicalsociety is sung by the animals who are observed by \u201cupright furless watchers\u201d day to day in a zoo. (\u201cWhy do they come?\u201d they wonder. \u201cWe\u2019re honestly not that much fun!\u201d)\nThe concept album, released online this month, features Jason Manford as a depressed monkey, Arthur Darvill and Louise Dearman as the bashfully mating pandas, Tyrone Huntley as an exasperated lion, and Natasha Barnes and Stone herself as gossipy giraffes. There\u2019s a military chorus of meerkats, a raucous simian duet and a tearjerking showstopper with Lucie Jones playing a pregnant penguin whose mate has cleared off. The musical is a digital commission by the Royal & Derngate theatre in Northampton and the album was always intended to be released before the show is fully staged. (That production may well now be delayed by the coronavirus outbreak that has closed theatres around the world.)\nStone tells me she grew up watching old musicals at her grandmother\u2019s house. \u201cShe\u2019d pop me in front of My Fair Lady and hope for the best,\u201d she says with a laugh. Stone\u2019s career has already encompassed solo fringe comedy shows, classical compositions and a dastardly panto turn, wearing a giant purple A on her head, as Abanazer in the Lyric Hammersmith\u2019s Aladdin in 2016. This year, she is writing a new version of Aladdin for the Lyric.\nStone is the composer and lyricist of #zoologicalsociety and co-wrote the book with Katie Mulgrew. She was interested in creating a show about communities and had considered setting a musical in one house, through successive decades\u2019 of occupants, but that idea was eclipsed by her zoo musical. Stone found herself studying not just the animals but also the visitors on the first of several research trips she made to London Zoo.\nThe behaviour of some of her characters is borne out by her research: such as Manford\u2019s miserable monkey, Alan, who rejects his pal\u2019s suggestions to \u201cchew on your own tail\u201d, \u201chave a massive piss\u201d or \u201cshow the crowd your asshole\u201d. \u201cMonkeys are more likely to be depressed in captivity if they can see people looking at them,\u201d says Stone. The pandas\u2019 song, One Day a Year, creates mirth and melancholy from the animals\u2019 narrow annual fertility window. \u201cThey struggle,\u201d explains Stone. \u201cIf they don\u2019t see other pandas mating they have no idea how to do it \u2013 which is why they\u2019re shown panda porn. Before they\u2019re fertile, they are shown videos of other pandas mating. Otherwise they don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d But the song will also strike a chord for listeners who are struggling to conceive and feel under pressure. \u201cI\u2019m of an age where lots of my friends are trying and people are going through IVF. I wanted to show that you are still whole if you don\u2019t manage it.\u201d\nGiraffes may not scientifically be proven to be monstrous gossips but Stone decided that, in a zoo, they\u2019d be the ones sticking their necks into everyone else\u2019s business. \u201cThey have a good view \u2013 but they don\u2019t have any facts,\u201d says Stone. \u201cThey come across as nice, they don\u2019t mean any harm, but what they talk about is quite toxic.\u201d One of the musical\u2019s standout tracks is the plaintive The Something Else, which is about experiencing anxiety but not having the words to express it. (Likened in the song to feeling \u201chomesick but you\u2019re already home\u201d.) It also reflects those animals in captivity who \u201cnever knew where they came from or what might have been. There\u2019s this lingering feeling that there could be something else but they don\u2019t know what it is.\u201d\nThe album, and an accompanying video for the song Marvin, comes with colourful illustrations by Tim Wheatley. Its release is obviously a joyous moment for Stone but has come at a testing time for the theatre industry, with venues closed and performers facing months of cancellations. Before the shutdown took hold, Stone was already having gigs cancelled. Her fiance is a musician and they have found themselves suddenly out of work. The last couple of weeks have felt, she says, like grieving. \u201cI cried. Of course you would! I\u2019d never catastrophised about both of us losing our jobs. You think: I\u2019ll always blag something. That\u2019s the nature of the business, hustling. Then suddenly there is nothing to hustle.\u201d\nBut right now there is a panto for her to plot, as well as another musical to develop, entitled Southbound, with its newly resonant storyline about a society that has fallen apart due to a virus. And there is the #zoologicalsociety to keep up with, before Brian the exasperated lion and his friends swap the cage for the stage.",

Corporate licences for big companies cost \u00a315.99 per month per host (and require a minimum of 50 hosts). The company reported an 85% increase in revenue to $166.6m (\u00a3132m) in the three months to the end of October, the latest quarterly figures available.\nZoom\u2019s recent surge in popularity has not gone unnoticed by investors. Zoom Video Communication\u2019s share price has soared from under $70 a share in January, before the coronavirus struck western countries, to $150 on Monday. That gives the company a market value of $42bn \u2013 more than eight times the market capitalisation of British Airways owner International Consolidated Airlines Group, for example.\nSome investors got so excited, they accidentally invested in the wrong Zoom. Shares in Zoom Technologies soared by more than 1,500% as investors rushed to buy shares in what they thought was the video app company \u2013 but was actually a defunct Chinese wireless communications company.\nThe US Securities and Exchange regulator intervened to suspend trading in Zoom Technologies. Investors may have been confused by Zoom Technologies\u2019 use of the stock market ticker ZOOM, while Zoom Video Communication has the ticker ZM.\nThe boom in Zoom Video Communication\u2019s share price has turned its founder and chief executive Eric Yuan into one of the world\u2019s richest people. Yuan, who owns 20% of the company\u2019s shares, has seen his estimated net worth increase by more than $4bn since the Covid-19 crisis started, to $7.9bn.\nAccording to the Bloomberg billionaires index, he is currently the 182nd richest person on earth, ahead of legendary investor George Soros, Star Wars creator George Lucas, and Virgin Group founder Sir Richard Branson.\nDespite the huge increase in his paper fortune Yuan, who created Zoom with the aim of \u201cmaking everyone happy\u201d, said he is trying not to get distracted by checking the stock market.\n\u201cIt\u2019s good that I am 50 now. If you had asked me this question when I was 25, I would tell you, \u2018yes, we are very excited about the stock price\u2019,\u201d he said in an interview with The Associated Press, conducted over Zoom.\n\u201cBut, now, seriously, I can tell you the truth, it don\u2019t matter. So the stock is up, it\u2019s good for our investors. If it\u2019s down, we keep working hard. I really do not focus on the stock price.\u201d\nYuan first came up with his idea for video-conferencing while at university in China in the 1990s, when he would travel by train for 10 hours to see his then-girlfriend, now his wife. \u201cI detested those rides,\u201d he told Thrive Global, \u201cI used to imagine other ways I could visit my girlfriend without travelling \u2014 those daydreams eventually became the basis for Zoom.\u201d\nYuan set his heart on moving to the US after watching a video of a Bill Gates speech about the transformational power of the internet. He said he knew the internet would be \u201cthe wave of the future\u201d and he wanted to be in the \u201cred hot\u201d centre of it in Silicon Valley.\nInitially his visa application was rejected, but \u201cI continued to apply again and again over the course of two years and finally received my visa on the ninth try\u201d, he said.\nAfter more than a decade working on video-conferencing technology at Cisco Webex, Yuan became frustrated and decided to strike out on his own. \u201cI firmly believed I could develop a platform that would make customers happy,\u201d he said. \u201cSo in June of 2011, I decided it was time to make the video communications solution I imagined during my college train trips a reality.\u201d More than 40 Cisco engineers followed him to Zoom.\nYuan said Zoom was not designed with home schooling or kids\u2019 birthday parties in mind, but is delighted that his app can bring young people some joy in the lockdown. \u201cKids are pretty smart, they always figure out new use cases,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are some very cool consumer use cases.\u201d\nWhile the Covid-19 pandemic has made him and his investors very rich, like everyone else, Yuan cannot wait for the crisis to be over. But he hopes that bosses will learn that employees can work just as well from home as they can in the office.\n\u201cI hope this crisis can be over very, very soon, but one thing I know for sure is that companies will learn this is the way to work,\u201d he said. \u201cI am pretty sure almost every company will be thinking about it and [will] say, \u2018hey, maybe working from home makes sense\u2019, and maybe let every employee work from home, maybe once a week. Previously, a lot of businesses didn\u2019t even want to try.\u201d",

        "content": "Former chief nursing officer says endemic nurse shortages and lack of protective equipment leave the NHS and patients vulnerable\nA failure to invest more in the nursing workforce has put the NHS on the \u201cbackfoot\u201d in combating Covid-19, according to Dame Christine Beasley, a former chief nursing officer (CNO) who now serves as a trustee at the Burdett Trust for Nursing.\n\u201cThe numbers sort of speak for themselves really, don\u2019t they?\u201d says Beasley of the endemic shortage of nurses that has left the NHS vulnerable at a time of crisis. Given that the nurses on the frontline risk becoming the patients, coronavirus presents a double whammy. This \u201cabsolutely demonstrates what we\u2019ve been saying for a long time\u201d, she says.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you could ever say that we could get all the people we need for a pandemic, but it has put us more on the backfoot than we might have been if there\u2019d been the proper investment.\u201d\nFigures show that nursing has lagged behind other NHS staff groups over the past decade, with the workforce growing by just 6.2% between November 2010 and November 2019, compared with 20.6% for hospital doctors, for example.\nBeasley, who is also chair of the London region of Health Education England, points to the fact that the pace of growth has stepped up in recent months.\nBut while figures show an increase in nurses of 3% between November 2018 and November 2019, the fact remains that the nursing vacancy rate for England totalled 38,785 in December 2019. \u201cIn order to deliver modern healthcare \u2013 however you look at it \u2013 and keep people safe, you can\u2019t do it without nurses; they\u2019re pretty critical,\u201d says Beasley. \u201cThis will give us a big impetus to demonstrate that as we begin to learn from what happens with this virus and what we need to do to keep our health service fit for purpose.\u201d\nBeasley, whose tenure as the government\u2019s chief nurse between 2004 and 2012 straddled the party political switch from New Labour to the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government, cites several reasons for the shortage: cuts in nurse training places early on in the coalition; the abolition of nursing bursaries in 2016, which covered university tuition fees as well as providing means-tested maintenance support; an ageing workforce; and the haemorrhaging of EU nurses. She also mentions poor retention as a significant factor. Figures show that turnover is still running at just under 12% a year. \u201cAll of that meant that we were in difficulties before this pandemic came along.\u201d\nKnowing that something needed to be done about nursing numbers, Boris Johnson made an election pledge for 50,000 more nurses by 2024-25. But the shine soon came off amid accusations of double counting when it emerged that over a third of the figure factored nurses already in the job.\nAlthough the government announced an annual grant of at least \u00a35,000 for healthcare students, which will kick in from September 2020, critics say this doesn\u2019t go far enough since tuition fee costs will remain a barrier for many.\nThat was before Covid-19 overtook events and it was all hands on deck. To help cope with the crisis, final-year nursing students in England have been asked to join the ranks, and a call-out for experienced hands has seen 5,605 former nurses and midwives come back. It\u2019s a sensible move and one that Beasley very much welcomes, but she doubts that the former nurses coming to help with the pandemic intend to return permanently.\nIt\u2019s down to the government to invest better financial support for nursing students and a more conducive environment for staff already in the workplace, says Beasley. And she doesn\u2019t just mean regarding working conditions and pay \u2013 the starting salary for a nurse is \u00a324,214 \u2013 but ensuring that nurses can further develop their skills and careers. She also makes the case for the need for nursing practice to change so that we can \u201cmake the most of the nurses that we have\u201d. This means allowing nurses to work to the top of their proficiency, supported by other colleagues such as nursing associates and healthcare assistants, and expecting more patients to manage their own health, including using basic technology. \u201cIt\u2019s happening in parts of the health service, but we need to push that much more.\u201d\nBeasley completed her own nurse training as far back as 1965, yet her interest in nursing shows no sign of waning. Since retiring as chief nursing officer, she has held a number of non-executive posts, and has been a trustee of the Burdett Trust for Nursing for nine years.\nThe charity, which grants funding to support nurse-led innovation, is also responsible for footing the \u00a3500,000 core costs for Nursing Now \u2013 a three-year global campaign to raise the profile and status of nursing worldwide, which concludes at the end of this year.\nBeasley says the battle against Covid-19 highlights the combination of technical skills and the \u201chuman touch\u201d that nursing provides. \u201cThis is a really good, but rather sad and awful, example [that] showcases what nurses can do to contribute to containing and looking after people who get sick through a pandemic.\u201d\nThe year 2020 is proving quite the moment for nursing: it has been designated the International Year of the Nurse and Midwife by the World Health Organization to coincide with the bicentenary of Florence Nightingale \u2013 the pioneer of modern nursing who first identified handwashing as key to infection control.\nAs chief nurse, Beasley pressed home the importance of clean hands during the battle against hospital-acquired methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in the early noughties. The initiative was very much nurse-led, she says.\n\u201cMost doctors didn\u2019t believe that it could really make any difference to MRSA because it was a byproduct of modern medicine, and consequently they slightly stepped aside,\u201d Beasley recalls. \u201cObviously they then came on board.\u201d She is pleased that awareness about handwashing, and the use of sanitisers in hospitals in battling infection are now the norm. But they are only part of the story in tackling the latest bug on the block.\nThere is a \u201cbig challenge\u201d in getting testing kits and protective equipment to hospitals to keep staff safe. \u201cThe equipment is getting through, but that needs to be sustained and it needs to be done faster.\u201d\nHealth and safety also means that staff should not be doing 12-14 hour shifts \u201cday after day after day\u201d. She adds: \u201cNo matter if you\u2019re a cross between Mother Teresa and the Angel Gabriel, you\u2019re not going to be able to sustain that.\u201d\n\u201cWhen all of this finishes, which one day it will, society will look back and say of both nurses and doctors: \u2018We need these folks. We can\u2019t just wait until something awful happens and then quickly ramp up the numbers.\u2019\u201d\nAge: 75.\nStatus: Married with three sons.\nLives: Ealing, west London.\nEducation: Westcliff high school for girls, Southend-on-Sea, Essex.\nCareer: 2004-12: chief nursing officer, Department of Health; 2003-04: partnership development director, NHS Modernisation Agency; 2002-03: head of development and nursing, Directorate of Health and Social Care; 1998-2002: regional director of nursing and operational development, NHS London; 1996-98: regional nurse director, North Thames; 1994-96: acting regional nurse director, North Thames Regional Health Authority; 1990-94: chief nurse, Riverside Health Authority; 1990-91: acting chief executive, Riverside Health Authority; 1987-90: director of community nursing, Hammersmith & Fulham; 1981-87: community services manager, Ealing Health Authority; 1978-81: district nurse, Ealing; 1969-78: career gap to raise three sons; 1965-68: staff nurse/junior sister, Royal London hospital; 1962-65: nurse training, Royal London hospital.\nPublic life: Trustee, the Burdett Trust for Nursing; chair of the Florence Nightingale Museum; chair, London region, Health Education England; chair of council, University of Buckingham.\nInterests: Gardening, family life.",

Demand for travel has collapsed in recent weeks as many countries are in partial or full lockdown, forcing airlines to cancel thousands of flights.\nGatwick is closing one of its two terminals from Wednesday and will only operate any remaining flights between 2pm and 10pm to cut costs to a minimum during the crisis.\nThe majority of Gatwick\u2019s 2,500 employees will be laid off in the coming days, with some having already taken voluntary redundancy. About 200 contractors have been laid off.\nA few foreign carriers, including the Gulf airline Qatar, are continuing to operate some flights, but otherwise only a few, unscheduled repatriation services are expected to pass through the airport in the coming weeks.\nBA, which is still running flights to and from Heathrow, said it would contact customers to discuss their options.\nThe consumer association Which? said that BA must offer refunds. Struggling airlines have been giving passengers vouchers or rebooking them for another date, but are legally obliged to pay out for cancellations. The global airline body, Iata, has warned that full refunds would cost the industry a collective $35bn (\u00a328bn) immediately at a time when many carriers face bankruptcy.\nA BA spokesman said: \u201cDue to the considerable restrictions and challenging market environment, like many other airlines we will temporarily suspend our flying schedule at Gatwick.\u201d\nThe airline will carry out essential work at Gatwick, including maintenance, to be ready to start up again once travel restrictions are relaxed.\nThe pandemic has pushed the global airline industry into crisis, with strict restrictions across most of the main air travel markets all but wiping out most airlines\u2019 revenues.\nIata\u2019s director-general, Alexandre de Juniac, warned: \u201cTravel and tourism is essentially shut down in an extraordinary and unprecedented situation. Airlines need working capital to sustain their businesses through the extreme volatility.\n\u201cCanada, Colombia and the Netherlands are giving a major boost to the sector\u2019s stability by enabling airlines to offer vouchers in place of cash refunds. This is a vital time buffer so that the sector can continue to function.\u201d\nThe UK aviation industry stepped up its criticism of the UK government, which has insisted that it will not offer an industry-wide bailout, and would only consider support on a case-by-case basis.\nThe Airport Operators Association said the US, Australia, Norway, Spain and France, among others, had all agreed packages of state aid including loans and credit guarantees. Its chief executive, Karen Dee, said the government was \u201clagging behind its international competitors when it comes to safeguarding our vital industry for the future\u201d.\nThe transport secretary, Grant Shapps, told the BBC on Tuesday: \u201cWe do want there to be competition in the airline market when we come out of this crisis. We are also firmly aware that airlines have shareholders \u2026 It can\u2019t be right that in good times the shareholders benefit and in bad times the taxpayer pays.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cWe\u2019re into now detailed discussion with airlines, airports, the ancillary services as well \u2026 It\u2019s a question of finding the right solutions from that wide range the chancellor has announced \u2026 and then anything we can do to assist.\u201d\nVirgin Atlantic, one of the first airlines to seek assistance, is among four carriers whose planes will be chartered by the government for a \u00a375m repatriation operation for Britons stranded abroad.\nThousands of airline staff have been temporarily laid off or are taking unpaid leave. Easyjet and Virgin are setting up schemes for thousands of laid-off crew to volunteer over the next two months with the NHS or work in supermarkets.\nOn Monday, Loganair, the Scottish regional carrier, said it would be seeking government assistance beyond that offered to all British companies via the chancellor\u2019s package of government-backed loans worth \u00a3330bn.\nBA\u2019s owner, International Airlines Group, on Monday said it had extended a $1.38bn (\u00a31.09bn) credit buffer by a year to June 2021. This means it has access to \u20ac9.3bn in cash, cash equivalents and loans, which it can use to get through the crisis.",

        "content": "Stephen Frears\u2019 smart adaptation of Nick Hornby\u2019s novel of stunted growth remains as compelling as ever with one of John Cusack\u2019s best performances\nRob Gordon is kind of a jerk. And High Fidelity, based on Nick Hornby\u2019s incisive dissection of the pop-addled male brain, is about the process of him becoming a little less of a jerk. It didn\u2019t seem necessary to point that out 20 years ago, when the film received exactly the niche appreciation it was destined to find, but it does now, because it\u2019s not often we\u2019re given a hero as blinkered as Rob Gordon and not told how we\u2019re supposed to feel about him.\nIn fairness, Rob is the one doing the telling here, and he\u2019s played by John Cusack, the affable goof of \u201cSavage\u201d Steve Holland comedies like Better Off Dead and One Crazy Summer, and the ingratiating underachiever of Say Anything \u2026, which had established him as a tender romantic soul about a decade earlier. When Cusack was cast as the lead in High Fidelity, it was hard not to think of him as a grownup version of Lloyd Dobler in Say Anything \u2026 \u2013 just as aimless and uncertain about the future, but coarsened by failed relationships and the grinding inertia of his professional life. Lloyd didn\u2019t want \u201cto sell anything, buy anything or process anything as a career\u201d, but here he is, buying and selling records at Championship Vinyl, a Chicago record store with a location \u201cchosen to attract a minimum of foot traffic\u201d.\nThe Lloyd Dobler comparison doesn\u2019t hold up much to scrutiny, however. At no point in his life has Rob possessed Lloyd\u2019s earnestness, openness and emotional generosity. At roughly the same age Lloyd was out there escorting the valedictorian around a patch of grass in the parking lot, Rob was breaking up with his girlfriend for not yielding to his aggressive advances. As High Fidelity ticks through his \u201cdesert island, all-time top-five most memorable breakups\u201d, Rob gets the opportunity to explain himself directly to the camera \u2013 an ingenious solution to the confessional first-person style of Hornby\u2019s book. But it doesn\u2019t mean that we, the jury, are going to find him persuasive. If anything, Rob\u2019s journey through his romantic past reveals how little he\u2019s learned or changed over time. And the film is richer for it.\nThe film version of High Fidelity has a strange, magical alchemy working for it: an American adaptation of a British novel, written by Americans (Cusack and his writing partners DV DeVincentis and Steve Pink, and Scott Rosenberg) and directed by a Briton (Stephen Frears), with the location shifted from London to the north side of Chicago. There\u2019s a universal quality to guys like Rob Gordon (Fleming in the book), a breed of disaffected Americans and Brits who spent their youth marinating in \u201csad bastard\u201d music from bands like the Smiths or the Cure, and later insulated themselves in college rock and obscure musical tributaries. The opening narration is potent: \u201cNobody worries about kids listening to thousands, literally thousands of songs about heartbreak, rejection, pain, misery and loss. Did I listen to pop music because I was miserable? Or was I miserable because I listened to pop music?\u201d\nThe establishing shot in High Fidelity says everything: as we listen to You\u2019re Gonna Miss Me by the 13th Floor Elevators played on Rob\u2019s stereo \u2013 the soundtrack selections throughout remain impeccable \u2013 Frears follows the headphone cord to his back profile. Here is a man who cannot get out of his own head, and it\u2019s currently getting pumped with the music that fortified him since adolescence. His long-term girlfriend Laura (Iben Hjejle) is moving out, and while it\u2019s tempting for a snob like him to brush off her career ambitions as selling out, in truth she left because he refused to change so much as a pair of socks for her. That leaves Rob to go through his top five breakups, because he needs to figure out why he always gets dumped.\nThe brilliance of High Fidelity, carried over from Hornby\u2019s funny, relentlessly self-deprecating book, is that we learn more about Rob from his mission to track down his former girlfriends than he ever learns about himself. He thinks he\u2019s gaining insight into his past \u2013 and passing it along to his confidants in the audience \u2013 but his behavior in the present is saying everything about why he\u2019s so terrible with women. His first call to the mother of his grade-school make-out partner is a light preview of the petty narcissism to come \u2013 he wants her to know that he was \u201ctechnically\u201d her daughter\u2019s first boyfriend, not the boy she would eventually marry \u2013 but it gets darker in a hurry.\nWhen Rob catches up to that high-school girlfriend (Joelle Carter), the one who\u2019d resisted his advances, he triggers the longstanding trauma of their breakup, which led to a sexual encounter with another boy she didn\u2019t want (\u201cit wasn\u2019t rape because I said, \u2018OK,\u2019 but it wasn\u2019t far off\u201d) and put her off relationships through college. She storms out but he\u2019s elated: he\u2019d dumped her, not the other way around as he\u2019d remembered. It\u2019s the lowest moment for Rob in High Fidelity, funny only in the cavernous depths of blinkered self-absorption that is the true reason why he\u2019s unlucky in love. It doesn\u2019t matter who does the dumping. What matters is that he\u2019s never cared to listen to the women right in front of him.\nIn retrospect, High Fidelity was a sneakily dark kick-off to a decade where arrested development was the primary theme of comedies about white guys who didn\u2019t have it together. The 40-Year-Old Virgin wouldn\u2019t come along for another five years \u2013 and that film and others from Judd Apatow and guests were a little more sweet than sour. But Frears\u2019 film does have the same arc toward maturity, compromise and a healthy adult relationship, and it also has the goofy friend types, Barry (Jack Black) and Dick (Todd Louiso), Rob\u2019s comrades in musical snobbery. The back-and-forth between Barry and Dick is established quickly and hilariously through their choice of music: Dick moping along to the new Belle & Sebastian, Barry whipping his tape across the room in favor of a mix that starts with Katrina & the Waves\u2019 Walking on Sunshine.\nOne of the film\u2019s most insightful and endearing qualities is how much it\u2019s willing to poke fun at Rob, Barry, and Dick\u2019s record-clerk arrogance without belittling their passions entirely. They have good taste. The music means something to them. And every once in a while, it can connect them to other people. Like when Dick courts a Green Day fan by introducing her to Stiff Little Fingers. (Absolutely no experience more awkward than trying to turn someone on to new music as they\u2019re standing right in front of you.) Or when Barry preaches the gospel of the Jesus and Mary Chain\u2019s Psychocandy. Or when Rob bets he can sell five copies of the Beta Band\u2019s The Three EPs by playing it in the store.\nGuys like Rob have perfected the art of the mixtape, of \u201cusing someone else\u2019s poetry to express how you feel\u201d, and they give them away like an aural valentine to the women that draw their interest. The elegant insight that Rob finally gleans from his failures with women \u2013 failures that are all on him \u2013 is that his feelings are only half of the equation and he might want to think about what the person he loves would want to hear. At one point in High Fidelity, after a one-night stand with a singer-songwriter he met at the late, lamented Lounge Ax, Rob says that \u201cwhat really matters is what you like, not what you are like.\u201d For someone of his pathology, growth is recognizing the opposite is true.",

Issued collectively, the \u201ccoronabond\u201d would drive down the borrowing costs of some of Europe\u2019s most heavily affected countries, staving off another sovereign debt crisis and freeing up much-needed resources to invest in public health and economic recovery. \u201cWe are all facing a symmetric external shock,\u201d the proposal read, \u201cand we are collectively accountable for an effective and united European response.\u201d\nAlas, the request for solidarity was swiftly rejected. At the video conference, the eurobond motion came up against the eurozone\u2019s \u201cfrugal four\u201d \u2013 Germany, the Netherlands, Austria and Finland \u2013 who argued that the issuance of a common debt instrument would punish the countries that had saved for such a rainy day, and encourage further fiscal mismanagement by those who did not. Solidarity, they claimed, just created moral hazard.\nIn the course of this standoff, it was the Netherlands that positioned itself as the stony face of the frugal four. For a small and trade-dependent country that has long portrayed itself as Europe\u2019s liberal beacon \u2013 open, progressive and internationally oriented \u2013 it was a remarkably short-sighted position to take. Without a collective mobilisation of fiscal resources, countries such as Italy and Spain will be powerless to prevent further contagion, of both the medical and economic kind. And as long as the pandemic continues to rage elsewhere in Europe, even the supposedly frugal burghers of Amsterdam will suffer the consequences.\nYet the Dutch government has held firm. Speaking after the meeting, the prime minister, Mark Rutte, declared that he could not foresee \u201cany circumstances in which the Netherlands will accept eurobonds\u201d. Adding insult to injury, the finance minister, Wopke Hoekstra, called on Brussels to investigate why some eurozone member states had failed to get their houses in order ahead of the pandemic \u2013 comments that the Portuguese prime minister, Ant\u00f3nio Costa, later described as \u201crepugnant\u201d and \u201csenseless\u201d.\nThe spat has reopened painful old wounds. In the early stages of the eurozone crisis, the Dutch were among the most vocal opponents of the initial Greek \u201cbailout\u201d, and demanded draconian austerity measures in return for the emergency loans. The former Dutch finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem gained widespread notoriety for his penny-pinching in the Greek debt negotiations, at one point appearing to suggest that his southern European neighbours had wasted their money on \u201cbooze and women\u201d.\nBut Europe\u2019s governments have run out of patience with such fiscal moralism. Over the weekend, reports suggested that Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Cyprus and Slovakia may add their names to the original eurobond proposal. Among these 14 governments, there is broad agreement that this is not the time for petty lectures on fiscal book-keeping, it is a time to think big and confront the continent\u2019s greatest collective challenge since the second world war as a united front. As Costa drily observed: \u201cNo one has any more time to hear Dutch finance ministers as we heard in 2008, 2009, 2010 and so forth.\u201d\nBeside its untimely nature, the Dutch government\u2019s position is also exceedingly hypocritical. The Netherlands has long been known as one of the world\u2019s most infamous tax havens, siphoning off hundreds of billions of euros in corporate profits and international financial flows and keeping other governments from taxing them properly. To depict the Netherlands as a pillar of fiscal rectitude is to deny the myriad ways in which the very architecture of the Dutch tax system actively serves to undermine the fiscal capacity of its European and international partners.\nUltimately, however, the best argument against the Dutch position is that it is self-defeating. By rejecting the call for \u201ccoronabonds\u201d, the Netherlands and its partners in the frugal four have undermined the ability of the wider eurozone to fight the pandemic as a whole \u2013 threatening the health and wellbeing of each of its members in turn.\nSolidarity is not charity. It is the recognition that the struggle of one is the struggle of all. In a pandemic like Covid-19, that logic is global. But it becomes all the more urgent in the context of a currency union as thoroughly integrated as the eurozone. If the frugal four continue to obstruct a common fiscal response to this crisis, the remaining eurozone countries will be right to ask if they are not better off going their own way.\nAs Spain\u2019s foreign minister, Arancha Gonz\u00e1lez, kindly reminded Hoekstra following his much-maligned intervention last week: \u201cWe are in this EU boat together. We hit an unexpected iceberg. We all share the same risk. No time for discussions about first- and second-class tickets \u2026 History will hold us responsible for what we do now.\u201d\n David Adler is a policy leader fellow at the School of Transnational Governance (EUI) and the policy coordinator of the Democracy in Europe Movement (DiEM25).

        "content": "West Ham\u2019s win was all the more memorable because their talented group of youngsters were soon to be broken up\nThey moved the ball quickly and gracefully, the three kids at the heart of West Ham\u2019s midfield. There was no hint of any fear, no sign of Michael Carrick, Joe Cole and Frank Lampard shrinking.\nThey took the ball in difficult areas and it was impossible not to admire how they determined they were to seize the moment against Manchester United, who would exit the FA Cup after Fabien Barthez\u2019s foolhardy decision to impersonate a man hailing a cab allowed Paolo Di Canio to steal a famous win.\nThe abiding image from that day at Old Trafford is of Barthez standing with his right arm aloft in an attempt to kid Di Canio into thinking he was offside after being played through by Freddie Kanout\u00e9 in the 76th minute.\nWest Ham\u2019s captain was far too wily to fall for the con. He kept his composure as he advanced and to the disbelief of the 9,000 travelling West Ham fans stabbed the ball past Barthez with his right foot. I was incredulous. Could it really be happening? Were West Ham really on their way to knocking United out of the Cup? Were they really 1-0 up at Old Trafford?\nThe mind drifted back to West Ham taking an early lead in a league game at the Theatre of Dreams a year earlier and United exacting brutal vengeance, scoring seven in reply. There were 14 minutes left. It felt too long to hold out. Surely United were going to score. To channel Clive Tyldesley, United always scored.\nIn that context we had not travelled with much hope. Harry Redknapp\u2019s entertaining but unreliable side had lost 3-1 against United in the league three weeks earlier and tended to be pretty useless when they visited the big sides. United, well on their way to collecting a third consecutive Premier League title, were expected to cruise into the fifth round.\nSir Alex Ferguson picked his strongest possible team. Paul Scholes was unavailable but Jaap Stam was in central defence, Nicky Butt partnered Roy Keane in midfield, Ryan Giggs and David Beckham were on the flanks and Andy Cole partnered Teddy Sheringham up front. There were threats to West Ham everywhere and United dominated the first half, creating several chances, especially when Giggs found room to dribble down the left.\nIt hardly helped West Ham that their goalkeeper, Shaka Hislop, was struggling with a knee injury. Early on Hislop sliced at a backpass and sent it spinning towards his own goal, only for Hannu Tihinen to race back and clear before Giggs could score. My dad and I were in agreement: this was going to be a long afternoon.\nYet United kept missing chances \u2013 Tihinen cleared off the line and Sheringham missed an open goal at the start of the second half \u2013 and West Ham gradually grew in confidence, thanks in no small part to the bravery and ability of Carrick, Cole and Lampard on the ball. Carrick was particularly impressive, pulling the strings from a deep position, and Cole caused countless problems with his trickery.\nUltimately it was a glimpse of what might have been. Two months had passed since West Ham sold Rio Ferdinand to Leeds for \u00a318m. That was the beginning of the end, the first sign West Ham were incapable of holding on to the talent emerging from their academy. Lampard joined Chelsea at the end of the season and West Ham were relegated two years later, going down with a record 42 points.\nIf there is one moment that sums up that lost opportunity, it is Cole, Carrick and Lampard playing their way out of trouble on the edge of their own area and sparking the move that led to Di Canio\u2019s winner. There was no doubting their ability; the problem was they would go on to win all their medals elsewhere.",

Some, including Chinese students, cannot access study materials due to internet censorship.\nA physics student, who is quarantined in Shanghai, said he was unable to access Panopto lecture recordings for his revision because the site was blocked by China\u2019s firewall. \u201cImperial College has made it more difficult than regular exams because now you have to deal with technology and censorship,\u201d he said.\nMax, not his real name, said Chinese students were also under great stress because relatives had died of Covid-19. \u201cMy grandmother passed away because of coronavirus,\u201d he said.\nThe physics student said he might also face being quarantined for another fortnight when he returns to his family home in Wuhan, the centre of the Chinese outbreak, which would end around the time when his exams are due to start.\nIn a statement, Imperial College said: \u201cWe are putting additional support in place for students and we are updating our mitigating circumstances policy to take account of where a student does not have access to the equipment or facilities to undertake the assessment.\u201d\nPiers Wilkinson, the NUS\u2019s disabled students officer, said the academic year should end now because universities cannot provide disabled students \u2013 who make up 13% of the student population \u2013 with the reasonable adjustments they are legally required to put in place due to the pandemic lockdown.\nWilkinson said most of the study support provided to disabled students could either only be delivered on campus or would be impossible to provide remotely. This included providing note-taking, sign-language interpreters, close captioning of lectures, and screen-readers that render text and image content as speech or Braille.\nHe added: \u201cThere is no way that disabled students can be on an equal level playing field as every other student during this pandemic. They should be allowed to suspend their studies until it\u2019s reasonable and equitable for them to start again.\u201d\nA Cambridge student with diabetes and depression, who has suffered panic attacks during exams, said the university had not explained how it would accommodate her disability in an online assessment. \u201cI\u2019m at high risk of getting really ill if I contract coronavirus as [I have] diabetes,\u201d she said. \u201cStress also adversely affects my blood glucose levels which makes it hard to get much done above staying healthy.\u201d\nCambridge University was approached for comment.\nA spokeswoman for Universities UK, which represents 137 higher education institutions, said universities were looking at various options to ensure students were fairly assessed. She added that \u201cuniversities will try to be as accommodating as they can\u201d to students\u2019 varying needs for support.",

A spokesperson said the ATO website registered 1.1m visits on Monday \u2013 double the traffic experienced on the previous Monday. The ATO also fielded 50,000 phone calls on Monday, about 50% more than the same time last year.\nSo far, more than 285,000 businesses have formally registered their interest in claiming the jobkeeper payment for their employees.\nThe ACTU, which started the push to adopt a UK-style wage subsidy in Australia, has said it will continue to lobby the government to ensure that casuals with less than 12 months\u2019 service \u2013 estimated to be 1 million of 3.3 million casuals \u2013 do not miss out.\nOn Tuesday, Labor\u2019s shadow industrial relations minister, Tony Burke, welcomed the creation of the jobkeeper payment, saying he was \u201cnot going to start picking the package apart\u201d.\nBut Burke said casuals\u2019 eligibility had been \u201craised with us by both workers and by businesses, I have to say, who rely on a workforce like that. That\u2019s one of the issues that we\u2019ll be looking at really carefully.\u201d\nZimmerman said the package was \u201cvery good\u201d and had been \u201cwell received generally\u201d, but casual eligibility was \u201can area of concern\u201d, although he could understand why the government had limited eligibility to those with 12 months\u2019 service with the same employer.\nBut Zimmerman said the current limit \u201cseems a bit difficult\u201d for casuals who may have worked for one employer for nearly 12 months then changed jobs to get more hours.\n\u201cI could have worked for nine to 12 months, then I left Joe Bloggs and three months ago I went to work for Mary Smith. Now you\u2019ve lost both those positions and aren\u2019t eligible for jobkeeper \u2013 that\u2019s the only area I can really see there\u2019s a problem.\n\u201cI think if you can show the continuation of your role, you should get it. It\u2019s something I will talk to the minister about.\u201d\nBut the chief executive of the Council of Small Business Organisations Australia, Peter Strong, said the government \u201chad to draw the line somewhere\u201d.\n\u201cMonday\u2019s announcement reflects a situation we\u2019ve never been in before \u2013 there are both winners and losers but it created an enormous number of winners,\u201d he told Guardian Australia.\n\u201cI suppose [casuals\u2019 eligibility] is going to be considered, but I for one am reluctant [to expand it] because where do you stop?\u201d\nStrong said the exclusion of many temporary visa holders was \u201cdefinitely a concern\u201d and the other pressing question for business was: \u201cIf workers are getting paid $750 a week, can their employer ask them to do work?\u201d\n\u201cThe workplace relations system hasn\u2019t caught up with the last century, let alone that question.\u201d\nOn Monday Scott Morrison said the benefit of the jobkeeper payment was that it assisted businesses that were \u201cstill functioning, when their employees are actually still at work\u201d.\n\u201cOur scheme is designed to actually keep people not just in pay but in actual work, wherever that\u2019s possible,\u201d the prime minister said.\nThe Greens leader, Adam Bandt, said the government\u2019s exclusion of casuals with shorter engagements and the flat rate of jobseeker payments would \u201cfail to keep Australians employed and still represents an inferior model\u201d to an 80% wage subsidy.\nThere are also concerns the casuals\u2019 eligibility threshold will have a gendered impact because women are over-represented in the retail and hospitality sectors, which have the most casuals with less than a year\u2019s service.\nHere\u2019s the gender split specially for you @EconomistAnge Fairly even split overall but more women in the two sectors heavily impacted - retail and hospitality. pic.twitter.com/gkni5wQLP7\nThe shadow employment and small business minister, Brendan O\u2019Connor, said the threshold was \u201cclearly more difficult for women often employed as casuals in sectors hit hard by the health crisis, and we want to ensure where we can that people don\u2019t fall through the cracks\u201d.\nO\u2019Connor has written to the employment minister, Michaelia Cash, querying whether businesses that have been in operation for under 12 months will be eligible.\nTo be eligible for the scheme, businesses will have to show they suffered a 30% decline in revenue \u201crelative to a comparable period a year ago\u201d \u2013 or 50% if the business turns over more than $1bn a year.\nO\u2019Connor wrote: \u201cSome businesses have contacted us believing the publicly released details of the jobkeeper payment means they are ineligible as they may not be able to compare a current period with significant declines in revenue to a comparable period a year earlier.\u201d\nO\u2019Connor urged Cash to give the issue \u201cimmediate consideration\u201d, warning that for new businesses \u201ca crisis such as this one is likely to wipe them out and in many cases they will never reopen\u201d.\nZimmerman said retailers \u2013 even those turning over more than $1bn \u2013 were likely to be able to show revenue decline significant enough to qualify.",

Valuable quantities of fibre have also been lost from major high street retailers such as McDonald\u2019s, Primark, John Lewis, Argos and B&Q after non-essential businesses were told to close.\nSimon Ellin, chief executive of the TRA, said: \u201cOf huge concern to us is the signs that Europe is already becoming short of fibre with which to make cardboard boxes. Food and medical supplies all move by cardboard box and if we can\u2019t make cardboard boxes, everything stops. If councils stop collecting recycling, and many are, all this fibre is burnt or goes to landfill and we will be short.\u201d\nThe body represents more than 100 organisations from the collection and processing sector, ranging from independent merchants, brokers, waste management companies and mills. It is the largest network of independent waste and recycling operators in the UK, with a combined annual turnover in excess of \u00a32bn.\nFibre recycling is a global market and materials flow across Europe and the world, but the lockdown means physical barriers are increasingly springing up to prevent this distribution. In Germany \u2013 the biggest European player \u2013 significant volumes of fibre come from Poland, but the Poland-Germany border is now shut. This has meant Germany is now seeking material from France and the UK.\nA spokesperson for the Local Government Association said: \u201cCouncils are leading local efforts to support communities through the coronavirus crisis. As councils prioritise protecting the vulnerable, there will be inevitable disruption to other important services, such as bin collections and street cleaning.\n\u201cSome councils are having to change their waste and recycling services as coronavirus impacts on their collection staff. They will continue to work hard to keep waste and recycling services working as effectively as possible.\u201d\nIn some parts of the UK there has been a surge in \u201cbackyard burning\u201d \u2013 which is illegal \u2013 following the closure of recycling centres and refuse tips because of the virus.\nFire crews in Wigan, for example, were recently called to at least 12 fires involving household waste following the closure of local recycling centres.\nMeanwhile, Unite, the UK and Ireland\u2019s largest union, is warning that some refuse contractors and local councils across the UK were failing to ensure that refuse workers are physically distancing and are provided with other safety measures to prevent coronavirus.\nIt has identified numerous reports of workers being expected to travel with three or four other workers in the cab of refuse wagons in clear contravention of physical distancing rules. It also reported complaints of a lack of gloves and hand sanitiser, failure to deep clean wagons and other issues.\nUnite national officer for local authorities Jim Kennedy said: \u201cUnite members recognise they are essential workers and want to deliver this key service, but they are becoming increasingly frightened that they, and by implication their families, are being exposed to unnecessary and needless risks, due to the flagrant disregard of contractors and councils of the rules.\u201d",

Kantar\u2019s Fraser McKevitt said the \u00a310.8bn spent on food and drink over the month was \u201ceven higher than levels seen at Christmas, the busiest time of year under normal circumstances\u201d.\nThe average household had bought an extra \u00a363 of shopping over the past four weeks \u2013 the equivalent to adding five days worth of groceries, Kantar said. With restaurants and cafes closed, an extra 500m meals and snacks are being eaten at home every week, it said, with the closure of pubs resulting in nearly \u00a3200m more being spent on alcohol in stores.\nBy the third week in March, Nielsen said many shoppers had already stocked up their store cupboards and pantries with essentials, and begun to prepare for the expected lockdown \u2013 announced the following week \u2013 by filling their freezers as well.\nSales of frozen food during that week soared 84% compared with the same period last year. This was also the week in which the government announced the closure of pubs and restaurants, resulting in a 67% surge in beer, wine and spirits sales.\nOnline grocery sales \u2013 which usually make up just 7% of the UK\u2019s \u00a3200bn grocery market \u2013 picked up sharply, with one-fifth of households placing an online order, equal to an additional 1.2m online grocery orders over the four weeks.\nGovernment restrictions on movement, along with relatively full grocery cupboards, would result in a step down in the number of shopping trips in April, Kantar suggested. \u201cSales of long-life and non-perishable items will slow as households work their way through stocks,\u201d said McKevitt. He expected panic buying to ease as \u201cconsumers gain confidence in the retailers\u2019 abilities to maintain grocery supplies and keep stock on the shelves\u201d.",

        "content": "Renters say governor\u2019s emergency eviction protections leave many behind and that the only option is to withhold money\nTenants across California are organizing rent strikes for the month of April, arguing they will not be able to pay their landlords for the foreseeable future and that the minimal protections now in place fail to provide relief for vulnerable renters.\nAs Covid-19 shelter-in-place orders have led to a surge in unemployment and slowed down the state\u2019s economy, the California governor, Gavin Newsom, has passed a two-month delay on imposing evictions for people who cannot pay rent due to the crisis. His order prevents the enforcement of evictions until the end of May but requires tenants to repay the full amount later, forces renters to jump through numerous hoops and opens the door for evictions to resume in June.\nWhile several large municipalities have passed stronger protections, tenants\u2019 groups say the governor\u2019s order does not go far enough and could pave the way for an even more catastrophic housing crisis than the one plaguing California before coronavirus.\nActivists are now coordinating rent strikes, a practice that has gained traction in LA in recent years and involves tenants organizing as a group, withholding rents and making collective demands.\n\u201cWe are all suffering, but we shouldn\u2019t have to suffer to this extent,\u201d said Melissa Reyes, a 25-year-old Los Angeles resident who plans to withhold her rent and is helping organize a strike in her Boyle Heights building. \u201cThis is about survival and necessity.\u201d\nNewsom\u2019s order only temporarily restricts the enforcement of evictions, still allowing landlords to start the eviction process, file notices and move to kick tenants out when the moratorium ends. His policy further requires tenants declare in writing that they can\u2019t pay due to Covid-19, and that they have documentation, which could be a hurdle for undocumented workers, people with non-traditional employment and those dealing with medical crises.\nIt also does not stop landlords from moving forward with evictions for reasons other than non-payment, such as remodeling or taking a rental off the market.\n\u201cIt includes a lot of ways for tenants to trip up,\u201d said Michael Trujillo, staff attorney at the Law Foundation of Silicon Valley\u2019s housing program, adding, \u201cThe governor has the power right now to just prohibit all evictions.\u201d\nIn a state where many workers have to divert a significant portion of their paychecks to rent, activists have called for a complete moratorium on evictions and foreclosures and a statewide suspension of rent, meaning a rent freeze or forgiveness so that tenants do not wind up with insurmountable debts.\n\u201cFor some, the decision is pay rent and starve, or don\u2019t pay rent and pay for food,\u201d said Chris Estrada, an organizer with the Los Angeles Center for Community Law and Action, which has fielded calls from dozens of tenants who don\u2019t have the cash to pay this week. For many others, he said, the reality is, \u201c\u2018If we pay April, will I starve in May?\u2019\u201d\nIn a city such as San Francisco, where the median rent for a one-bedroom is $3,479, paying retroactively will be impossible for many. \u201cIf six months later, I had a $20,000 debt waiting for me that I was expected to pay off right away, that would not be possible, especially after months of not having a stable paycheck,\u201d said Lupe Arreola, executive director of Tenants Together.\nThe city of Oakland has passed what advocates said was the strongest protection in the state, with a moratorium that prohibits all evictions and prevents late fees and rent hikes in the next two months. While tenants will owe back rent when the emergency is over, the ordinance prohibits landlords from evicting them because of non-payment during that time, a move meant to encourage payment plans. \u201cThis should be passed everywhere,\u201d said Leah Simon-Weisberg, an Oakland attorney, adding that she did not know a single tenant advocate in the state who supported Newsom\u2019s much weaker policy.\nLA\u2019s city council stopped short of passing a complete ban on evictions and requires tenants defend themselves against an eviction in court. The policy gives tenants a year to repay landlords. San Francisco also continues to allow limited evictions.\n\u201cThe reality is corporate landlords are already negotiating with their banks to figure out their mortgage situation and how to not pay,\u201d said Kenia Alcocer, 34, who will not be paying rent in East LA and is helping other tenants strike. \u201cWhy not us? We\u2019re the ones most impacted.\u201d\nAlcocer, an organizer with the group Union de Vecinos, gave birth in January to her second child, who suffered from numerous medical complications, which has already been a huge financial strain on her family and has escalated Covid-19 concerns. She estimated that more than 300 tenants who have worked with her group would not be paying rent this week, adding: \u201cThey are talking to their neighbors and their family members, and the numbers are growing rapidly.\u201d\nAlcocer is encouraging others to strike in solidarity and said she heard from one tenant who panicked, paid April\u2019s rent and now regrets it: \u201cNow, he has no money for food, no money for anything else. He has no job.\u201d\nThe LA Tenants Union is pushing a \u201cfood not rent\u201d campaign and urging people not to pay this month even if they temporarily can afford it.\nTracy Jeanne Rosenthal, a co-founder of the union, said that while there were clear risks to striking, \u201cThere has never been a better time to use what little power we have, which is often your rent check, as a way of demanding that the city and state do right by a majority of its constituents.\u201d\nIn LA county, she noted, an estimated 600,000 people spend 90% of their income on rent: \u201cTenants were already in crisis.\u201d\nSome have noted that the $1,200-a-person check from the government as part of its Covid-19 stimulus package would barely make a dent in some people\u2019s rent even as the emergency bill offers major benefits to large corporations. And activists have argued that although corporate landlords should not get bailouts, smaller property owners should also see a suspension of mortgage payments.\nKyle Cunningham, a 32-year-old Boyle Heights resident, said he had lost all income as a freelance camera operator and that he had asthma and was uninsured. Withholding rent was the only feasible option for him and his fiance, who is also a freelancer, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s a completely unprecedented situation for me. I\u2019ve always paid \u2026 But I need to redirect the money I have to protect my family and buy groceries and the other necessities we need to stay inside.\u201d\nCarolina Reid, faculty research adviser at the Terner Center for Housing Innovation at UC Berkeley, said without drastic action, she feared the economy and housing market was heading toward another crash like the foreclosure crisis of 2008, which led to widening inequality and is still affecting California a decade later: \u201cI\u2019m worried about what happens when this crisis ends.\u201d\nJesse Melgar, a spokesman for Newsom, did not respond to specific criticisms about the policy, saying in an email the order would provide \u201csignificant relief to millions of Californians who worry about making rent next week and in the months to come \u2013 especially in jurisdictions around the state that didn\u2019t act locally to implement their own moratoriums\u201d, adding, \u201cThese protections provide a strong, statewide foundation that cities can build upon.\u201d",

        "content": "Sajid Hussain, who wrote about rights abuses in Balochistan, had been granted Swedish asylum\nA prominent Pakistani journalist who fled the country after receiving death threats has gone missing in Sweden where he had been granted political asylum.\nSajid Hussain, 39, went into self-imposed exile in 2012 after his reporting on forced disappearances and human rights abuses in the turbulent region of Balochistan had led to death threats. He had continued to run an online newspaper, the Balochistan Times, from abroad covering the same topics.\nHussain was last seen at around 11am on 2 March in the Swedish city of Uppsala where he was living. A day after he stopped answering calls, a friend told the police about his disappearance and he was officially registered as a missing person on 5 March.\nDaniel Bastard, the Asia Pacific head of Reporters Without Borders, said: \u201cHussain could be a victim of enforced disappearance, given the circumstances of his case and testimony by his family and colleagues. Now, when you think about who could find interest in suppressing a dissident journalist, the first hypothesis leads to Pakistan\u2019s security agencies.\u201d\nHussain\u2019s family have not accused anyone of involvement in his disappearance and are simply urging the Swedish police to give them an answer.\nHussain\u2019s wife, Shahnaz Baloch, is still in Pakistan with their two children, aged five and nine, but was due to join her husband in Sweden this year. She wasone of the last people to speak to him on the morning he went missing. She said he had been in good spirits and they had spoken about his plans to move apartments before he started a master\u2019s degree at Uppsala University.\n\u201cSajid never went anywhere without informing me and his close friends,\u201d Baloch said. \u201cThis is very unusual and disturbing. Swedish police have been slow in working on the case as they believe people go in isolation in Sweden.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cHe was a voice for thousands of people living inside and outside of Balochistan. I believe an outside force is involved in his disappearance because Sajid would not disappear without informing anyone. He was an influential journalist and writer and had faced threats before.\u201d\nHussain is from a well-known political family in Balochistan, which has long been a battleground between armed insurgents and security forces. His uncle Ghulam Mohammad Baloch was killed in 2011 while heading a nationalist movement.\nHussain had worked for numerous news outlets in Pakistan, reporting on abuses in Balochistan around drugs, human rights and enforced disappearances, but fled the country in 2012 when police raided his house, taking his laptop and interrogating his family, and intelligence services visited his associates. Hussain had continued his journalism as he moved from the United Arab Emirates, Oman and then Uganda before settling in Sweden in 2018, and was given political asylum in 2019.\nTalat Aslam, the editor of News International, one of Pakistan\u2019s largest English-language newspapers, who worked with Hussain for five years, said: \u201cThe case is so baffling and I am so worried for him. His asylum case had been accepted and everything was going well. He had told me that he even planned to take his family out there as the authorities in Sweden had interviewed them.\n\u201cThis is very mysterious and very depressing. I have tried to write to police in Sweden and contacted other concerned authorities about the case, but they are very evasive.\u201d\nPakistan is one of the most dangerous countries to be a journalist and there have been increased reports recently of exiled reporters and bloggers based in Europe facing threats. In February, Ahmad Waqass Goraya, a Pakistani blogger living in Rotterdam, was attacked and threatened outside his home by two figures allegedly from the Pakistan intelligence agency.",

        "content": "ONS figures suggest almost one in five deaths occurring outside hospitals\nAn additional 40 previously unreported coronavirus deaths occurred in England and Wales earlier this month, according to new official backdated figures that suggest almost one in five coronavirus deaths are occurring outside hospitals.\nThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures, which are based on death certificates, show there were 210 deaths where Covid-19 was listed as a cause by 20 March, 40 more than the 170 announced by the NHS at that stage.\nThe figure is higher because it includes deaths outside hospitals, including those in homes and care homes, and includes patients who have not tested positive for the virus but are suspected of having the disease. It suggests that there were almost 24% more coronavirus deaths than had previously been reported in government figures.\nDavid Leon, professor of epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the figures help provide a more accurate record of the true extent of the impact of the virus. He said: \u201cWhat ONS has done is important as it starts to provide a more complete picture of the impact of Covid-19 on mortality. The value of these data will increase with time.\u201d\nThe ONS also found that Covid-19 deaths accounted for 1% of the UK\u2019s total deaths in the week ending 20 March.\nThe figures are the first set of backdated Covid-19 deaths, which the ONS will now announce every Tuesday morning.\nA spokeswoman for the ONS said the figures were based on registered deaths. She said: \u201cIt is based on mentions of Covid-19 on death certificates. It includes suspected cases of Covid-19 where someone has not been tested positive for Covid-19.\u201d\nUntil now the only death rate figures available in the UK have been the daily count from hospitals of patients who have tested positive.\nThe ONS spokeswoman said: \u201cIf the coroner or doctor has written there was suspected coronavirus or coronavirus on a death certificate, that will be counted in this bulletin.\u201d\nExplaining the different methodologies used by the ONS and NHS in counting coronavirus deaths, the spokeswoman said: \u201cBoth sets of data have got their different merits, which we will outline in the bulletin. There are different reasons as to why both sets of data are being collected. The data from the NHS are the quickest, whereas with our data, we have to wait for the deaths to be registered.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cFuture analysis will look at where Covid-19 is an underlying cause of death or a contributory factor.\u201d\nSir Patrick Vallance, the UK\u2019s chief scientist, conceded that both sets of data would need to be reconciled.\nSpeaking at the daily Downing Street briefing on Monday, he said: \u201cThe ONS data will pick up also those people who didn\u2019t die in hospital, but may have died from coronavirus in the community. So that will lead to some extra numbers. Don\u2019t expect those to be large, and it is important going forward that we have this reconciliation between all of the numbers.\u201d\nSarah Caul, head of mortality analysis at the ONS, said the new data was slower to put together than daily figures released by the NHS, but more accurate.\n  In an ONS blogpost on the new figures, she said: \u201cNumbers produced by ONS are much slower to prepare, because they have to be certified by a doctor, registered and processed. But once ready, they are the most accurate and complete information.\nShe added: \u201cWe include all deaths where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate, even if only suspected; the government figures are only those deaths where the patient had a positive test result.\n\u201cWe include deaths that happened anywhere in England and Wales, for example some might be in care homes: the government figures are only those that happened in hospital.\u201d\nTuesday\u2019s release by the ONS also provides the first detail about the age, gender and place of residence of some of the first people to have died with coronavirus in England and Wales, detailing 108 deaths registered before 20 March.\nTo date 64 were male, 59% of the total. This is in keeping with indications from China, France, Germany, Iran, Italy, South Korea and Spain that men are more likely to die from the disease.\nThe older age categories are hardest hit: 42% of deaths occurred among those aged 85 and over, while almost a third (31%) were between 75- and 84-years-old. Almost one in five were aged between 65 and 74.\nThe majority of deaths occurred in London and the south-east, at 41% and 18% respectively. A further 15% of deaths were among those living in the West Midlands, while 12% were from the north-west.\nBecause the ONS figures are based on registrations, some of these deaths have already been covered by the Department of Health and Social Care\u2019s daily figures which, to date, have listed all deaths involving coronavirus that have occurred in hospitals in the UK.\nBut because of the nature of how deaths are registered, (it takes at least five days for most deaths to be certified by a doctor, registered and the data processed) it is likely that more deaths have occurred which have not yet been counted by the ONS.\nSeparately, there have been some significant delays in counting hospital deaths appearing in the NHS England figures. One death reported on Monday actually occurred on 13 March in Mid Essex hospital services NHS trust, a 17-day lag. Another, first reported on Saturday, actually occurred in Sandwell and West Birmingham hospitals NHS trust on 13 March.\nAt least 33 deaths reported by NHS England between Thursday and Sunday actually occurred more than a week earlier.\n\u201cThere are various reasons why a hospital trust might delay reporting a death, including contact tracing, the internal validation processes and staff absences. For sheer capacity reasons, it\u2019s occasionally necessary for some trusts to report over a longer time period,\u201d an NHS spokesperson said.\n This article was amended on 1 April 2020. An earlier version said the ONS figures suggested nearly one in four coronavirus deaths were occurring outside hospitals; that should have said one in five deaths. The new data also suggests there were almost 24% more coronavirus deaths than previously reported in government figures, not that \u201c24% of coronavirus deaths had gone unreported\u201d as the earlier version expressed it.",

From being worn by slaves through to members of the Black power movement, it is a potent sartorial symbol of African-Caribbean survival and celebration.\nAfter a period of criminalisation (it was banned by some high schools in the US), it has been reclaimed. As Observer beauty columnist Funmi Fetto wrote in Vogue: \u201cThe tainted fabric has been reclaimed as a symbol of black beauty, a signifier of style worn on the streets, the catwalk, the red carpet ... And now, in a powerful mic-drop moment, the durag is making its first appearance on the May 2020 cover of British Vogue.\u201d\n\u201cDid I ever imagine that I would see a durag on the cover of Vogue?\u201d asked the British Vogue editor Edward Enninful on his Instagram page.\nIn the lengthy post, Enninful revealed that it was the singer\u2019s idea to wear the headwear, which was designed by the famed milliner Stephen Jones. \u201cFor this month\u2019s shoot, she wanted Rihanna for a new decade,\u201d he said. \u201cWe worked through a substantial archive of visual references (her fashion and cultural knowledge is encyclopaedic) to find a new proposition,\u201d he explained. \u201cThen suddenly, at 2am, my phone pinged with the latest WhatsApp: \u2018How about we go with a durag?\u2019\u201d\nIt\u2019s not the first time the singer has worn the garment. At the 2014 Council of Fashion Designers of America awards she paired a sheer, Swarovski encrusted Adam Selman dress with a crystal durag. Two years later, she she opened the 2016 MTV VMA\u2019s wearing a black and white design by Moses Gauntlett Cheng.\nMore recently, versions of the headdress were worn by singers Solange and Janelle Monae at the 2018 Met Gala, while in January, the Californian rapper Guapdad 4000 wore a 10ft-long durag on the Grammys red carpet, designed by Faded NYC.",

Although there is an acceptance from some within the game that coaches and players at top-flight clubs will have to accept wage deferrals, an agreement has not been reached.\nClubs are determined to act collectively rather than unilaterally but Gordon Taylor, the chief executive of the Professional Footballers\u2019 Association, has said the union will block a blanket wage deferral for players.\nTaylor suggested some owners could look to capitalise on the Covid-19crisis by saving money on salaries, a view privately echoed by some agents, but clubs are worried about their income drying up.\nSpurs are the second Premier League side to apply to the government\u2019s coronavirus job protection scheme, which allows staff to claim 80% of their wages, to a maximum of \u00a32,500 per month. Newcastle placed non-first-team staff on furlough on Monday.\nOne executive has told the Guardian that laying off people in non-playing departments would barely scratch the surface when so much is spent on paying players. The clubs, who are set to discuss pay again when the league holds its next video conference on Friday, are concerned about running into cashflow problems while games are suspended and they have made that clear to the PFA.\n\u201cWe have seen some of the biggest clubs in the world such as Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Juventus take steps to reduce their costs,\u201d Levy said in a statement on Spurs\u2019 website. \u201cYesterday, having already taken steps to reduce costs, we ourselves made the difficult decision \u2013 in order to protect jobs \u2013 to reduce the remuneration of all 550 non-playing directors and employees for April and May by 20% utilising, where appropriate, the government\u2019s furlough scheme. We shall continue to review this position.\n\u201cWe hope the discussions between the Premier League, PFA and LMA will result in players and coaches doing their bit for the football ecosystem.\u201d\nLevy said the \u201ccrushing devastation\u201d caused by coronavirus would affect industries across the world and pointed out football would be no different, warning it will be difficult for clubs to spend heavily on transfers.\n\u201cWhen I read or hear stories about player transfers this summer like nothing has happened, people need to wake up to the enormity of what is happening around us,\u201d he said. \u201cWith over 786,000 infected, nearly 38,000 deaths and large segments of the world in lockdown we need to realise that football cannot operate in a bubble.\n\u201cWe may be the eighth largest club in the world by revenue according to the Deloitte survey but all that historical data is totally irrelevant as this virus has no boundaries.\n\u201cThe club\u2019s operations have effectively ceased, some of our fans will have lost their jobs and most will be worried about their future. Our sponsors will be concerned about their businesses and our media partners have no certainty when we may play games again or whether we will be allowed to play in front of our fans. In the meantime, the club has an annual cost base running into hundreds of millions of pounds.\u201d",

        "content": "Study will follow 1,000 people in Heinsberg to create plan for how to deal with virus\nGerman scientists have announced what they described as a first-of-its-kind study into how coronavirus spreads and how it can be contained, using the country\u2019s worst-hit district as a real-life laboratory.\nThe virus has spread more widely among the 250,000 residents of Heinsberg \u2013 a district in North Rhine-Westphalia bordering the Netherlands \u2013 than anywhere else in Germany, with 1,281 confirmed infections and 34 deaths. More than 550 people have recovered from the illness so far. The advance of the virus in Heinsberg, nicknamed \u201cGermany\u2019s Wuhan\u201d after the Chinese city where the global pandemic emerged, is between two to two and a half weeks ahead of the rest of the country.\nOver the coming weeks the district will be used by leading virologists and a team of 40 medical students as a sort of laboratory for studying the virus. The \u201cCovid-19 case cluster study\u201d, launched on Tuesday morning, will follow 1,000 people who have been chosen because they are representative of the German population as a whole.\nThe results will be used to create a blueprint for how Germany might deal with the virus over the next few years, said Prof Hendrik Streeck, the head virologist at the University of Bonn.\n\u201cThis is a big chance for the whole of Germany,\u201d Streeck told a meeting of parliamentarians that was streamed live on television. \u201cWe\u2019ll be gathering information and practical tips as to how to deal with Covid-19 and how we can achieve further containment of it, without our lives having to come to a standstill over a period of years.\u201d\nThe World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.\nThe UN agency\u00a0advises\u00a0people to:\nMany countries are now enforcing or recommending curfews or lockdowns. Check with your local authorities for up-to-date information about the situation in your area.\u00a0\nIn the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should\u00a0stay at home for at least 7 days.\nIf you live with other people,\u00a0they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.\nThe study\u2019s results will potentially have implications for other countries.\nThe scientists will go into 500 households, as well as kindergartens and hospitals, to study how the infection is spread. They will look at every aspect ofeveryday life, from the extent to which children pass it on to adults, how it is spread within families \u2013 from mobile phones to door handles, to cups and TV remote controls \u2013 to whether pets can spread it, and whether it is transferred via certain types of food. \u201cIf there are ways of preventing the illness from spreading in our environment, we want to know what they are, with the goal of finding out how we can freely move about in the environment together,\u201d Streeck said.\n\u201cOn the basis of our findings we\u2019ll be able to make recommendations, which politicians can use to guide their decision-making,\u201d Streeck said. \u201cIt could be that the measures currently in place are fine, and we say: \u2018Don\u2019t reduce them.\u2019 But I don\u2019t expect that, I expect the opposite, that we will be able to come up with a range of proposals as to how the curfews can be reduced.\u201d\nBy testing the immunity to Covid-19 of the study\u2019s participants, the scientists will also be able to establish what the estimated number of undetected cases might be nationwide. The first results are expected to be made public next week, though the entire gathering of evidence will take several weeks and its analysis is likely to be carried out over months and years.\nStreeck said he was unaware of any other studies of its kind being carried out in other hotspots, such as Wuhan in China, Ischgl in Austria, Bergamo in Italy or Alsace in France. He was surprised that the government\u2019s advisers on public health matters had not come up with the idea already, \u201cbecause after all, containment is of national interest\u201d, he said.\nHe said he hoped the study would help decision-makers in the \u201cethical dilemma\u201d of establishing a balance between maintaining livelihoods and managing the death rate.",

They are at best a kneejerk reaction to an as yet unquantified problem instigated by panic, and at worst something far more sinister.\u201d\nNicola Sturgeon, the first minister, said the jury trial measures were necessary to ensure that serious criminal trials did not halt entirely, with significant disruption and uncertainty for the accused and victims.\nThe government said the European convention on human rights obliges states to maintain an effective justice system, and it believed the proposals were lawful and justified. Social distancing regulations meant it was impossible for juries, which are 15-strong in Scotland, to sit together, while illnesses and self-isolation would impact on witness availability and safety.\n\u201cWe are not deaf or blind to the concerns around these powers,\u201d Sturgeon said. \u201cWe would never have wanted to be in a position to pass legislation like this. We wouldn\u2019t be doing it unless we thought it was necessary for the protection of the population.\u201d\nMike Russell, the Scottish constitutional affairs minister, said the powers had been sought by the head of the Scottish judiciary, Lord Carloway, and the head of the prosecution system, the lord advocate, James Wolffe QC.\nRussell said the powers would be strictly time-limited, and could only last for a maximum of 18 months with Holyrood\u2019s approval, and were also subject to two monthly reports to the Scottish parliament. \u201cWe want to keep people safe,\u201d he said.\nIn a lengthy statement, Carloway, the lord justice general, said courts faced a \u201cmonumental\u201d backlog in cases, so the powers to try cases without juries and with looser rules on witnesses were necessary. Otherwise, more than 1,000 trials could be delayed.\n\u201cUnless action is taken to mitigate the impact of this, there will be substantial delays in bringing accused persons to trial. These are likely to stretch into years rather than months,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThis will have many adverse impacts, including uncertainty for the accused, complainers and witnesses. Such delays will have a highly disruptive effect on their lives, and potentially on the wider system.\u201d",

        "content": "Spread of coronavirus has not slowed drumbeat of successive layers of punitive measures imposed by the state department\nAt a time when all of humanity is facing a common, invisible, enemy, world leaders have called for a suspension of economic sanctions that have increasingly become the pursuit of war by other means.\nThe Trump administration has responded so far by ignoring those appeals and intensifying punitive measures on the two nations it has identified as America\u2019s greatest enemies: Iran and Venezuela.\nThe spread of coronavirus has not slowed the regular drumbeat of successive layers of sanctions imposed by the state department on Iran. Last week, a new list of people and companies linked to the Revolutionary Guard was targeted.\nOn the same day, the justice department unveiled drug trafficking and money-laundering charges against Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and 14 top current and former officials.\nBriefing the press on the indictment, attorney general William Barr left little doubt about their political nature, portraying the coincidence with the pandemic as serendipity, claiming it will spur on regime change.\n\u201cIt\u2019s good timing, actually,\u201d he said. \u201cThe people in Venezuela are suffering, and they need an effective government that responds to the people.\u201d\nPeter Harrell, a former senior sanctions official at the state department, said: \u201cThe administration is taking a kind of \u2018kick them while they\u2019re down\u2019 approach, seemingly with the hope that by piling on sanctions and other actions, the administration can capitalize on the virus in Iran and Venezuela to spur greater public opposition to the incumbent governments and perhaps regime change.\u201d\nThe US laid out a new plan for Venezuela on Tuesday, calling it a \u201cdemocratic transition framework\u201d, proposing Maduro step aside, foreign forces leave the country, and the creation of an interim government, a \u201ccouncil of state\u201d chosen by the major factions of the opposition-run national assembly, in return for sanctions relief.\nIn terms of actual concrete economic damage, last Thursday\u2019s new measures are unlikely to make much difference. Iran and Venezuela are so heavily sanctioned already that there is precious little income left to cut off. But they signal US determination not to relent even in the face of a mounting coronavirus death toll.\nThe new measures have been imposed at a time when both countries, long mired by chronic mismanagement and corruption \u2013 are facing plunging oil prices on which both producer nations are dependent for foreign currency.\nIn Tehran, government ineptitude allowed coronavirus to spread unhindered for weeks before serious action was taken. There are now more than 40,000 infections and 2,757 deaths in the country.\n\u201cThe government\u2019s response to the outbreak of Covid-19 in the early weeks is really responsible for where the country is today,\u201d said Ariane Tabatabai, a scholar at Columbia University.\nIn Venezuela, the pandemic has yet to hit in full force: just over 100 cases have so far been reported. But the country is in an even worse state to cope when it does, with disastrous results for its population and the region, home to some 5 million Venezuelan refugees.\nOnly a quarter of Venezuela\u2019s doctors have access to a reliable supply of water and two-thirds are without soap, gloves or masks. There are 73 intensive care beds in the whole country.\n\u201cIf the virus were to take off in Venezuela, and the country were not to receive a huge injection of international support, it would face an absolute disaster,\u201d said Ivan Briscoe, Latin American and Caribbean director at the International Crisis Group.\nThe United Nations secretary general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, and other top UN officials have called for a sanctions ceasefire around the world\n\u201cIn a context of global pandemic, impeding medical efforts in one country heightens the risk for all of us,\u201d Michelle Bachelet, the UN commissioner for human rights, said. \u201cThe populations in these countries are in no way responsible for the policies being targeted by sanctions, and to varying degrees have already been living in a precarious situation for prolonged periods.\u201d\nThe Trump administration has insisted that its sanctions regimes are aimed at the governments of Iran and Venezuela and not their populations.\nIt points to exemptions for humanitarian goods, which were established in the last days of the Obama administration.\nHowever, such exemptions exist more in theory than in reality. International banks are so skittish about handling any kind of trade with Iran that it is almost impossible to get financing for humanitarian goods purchases.\nAdding to the uncertainty, some medical equipment that has become essential for fighting the coronavirus is on a list of dual-use items that requires specific US Treasury authorisation. The line between permissible and forbidden items is badly defined.\nEven before the pandemic hit, the US sought to open up a separate channel for humanitarian goods, through Switzerland, but it is mainly relevant for companies with Swiss subsidiaries and suffered from the same uncertainties as other channels.\n\u201cThe consequence of all that is that Iran has a really hard time making speedy and reliable payments for these types of humanitarian items,\u201d Esfandyar Batmanghelidj, an expert on economic diplomacy and founder of the Bourse & Bazaar. \u201cWhat that means right now, when you\u2019re dealing with an acute crisis like this and you have a sudden surge in demand. Iran is basically going to be at the back of the line.\u201d\nOn Tuesday, the long-delayed first export was made through a European payments mechanism, Instex, set up 14 months ago to insulate Iran from US sanctions. According to the Wall Street Journal, the shipment was of medical equipment worth 500,000 euros, ordered before the coronavirus outbreak.\nVenezuela is already selling its oil at a significant discount and the price collapse could make it uneconomical to export. At the same time, the political standoff between Maduro and his US-backed challenger, Juan Guaid\u00f3, who are recognised as the head of state by different countries, makes it impossible for the country to get aid money. The International Monetary Fund turned down Maduro\u2019s request for $5bn in emergency aid funds, because of the lack of clarity of who was in charge.\nAware of the gravity of the situation, both sides have been in talks about the possibility of a unity government, negotiations that were disrupted by timing of the Maduro indictment \u2013 which by charging top generals at the same time, made it less likely the military would desert the incumbent leader.\nSanctions advocates argue they are humane alternatives to waging war for foreign policy objectives, but in both Iran and Venezuela that argument is weakening with the advance of the pandemic.\nRichard Nephew, former principal deputy coordinator for sanctions policy at the state department, said:\u201cIt is very difficult to argue that sanctions are intended to serve the best interests of the international community on the whole and the countries being targeted in particular if they are also perceived as worsening an unrelated humanitarian crisis.\u201d",

It is where it is. But that just means there\u2019s additional strains on a system that will find it difficult to respond at high speed under this kind of stress. Staffing that is already stretched will be even more stretched.\u201d\nThe aim is to recruit about 200 volunteers in each local authority, creating an army of 30,000 in total \u2013 all of whom will already have the necessary DBS checks, and relevant experience in the education and children\u2019s care sector.\nLongfield said there were an estimated 1 million vulnerable children in England who were at risk of becoming invisible during the crisis. \u201cThose might be children who have or have had a social worker in the past couple of years, in households which are not stable, where there are things like domestic violence, addiction to drugs and alcohol and severe mental health issues.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of children, those who are on the edge of services which are going to be under ever greater pressure. School for them is a real protective factor. They get a couple of hot meals a day, they get that structure, that support and that will be lost.\u201d\nLongfield said there were many schools serving disadvantaged communities which already operated as high-functioning community centres and were in close contact with their vulnerable families. \u201cBut that will not be the same for every school. Not all schools have that engagement with the community or even see it as their role.\u201d\nHer hope was therefore \u201cto get this army of people who are all DBS checked, all there for children and for families and actually be able to harness that locally around a school as a community hub to make sure they can reach out and get to families\u201d.\nLongfield went on: \u201cI don\u2019t want any child to be harmed because of coronavirus. I don\u2019t want any child to go hungry because of coronavirus. I don\u2019t think we can let children pay the price for this terrible health emergency.\n\u201cWe have to step up and make the very bold moves that we\u2019ve seen in terms of some of the employment and fiscal decisions over the last week, and actually put the kind of support in place for these children that makes sure that they\u2019re safe and stable and get the support they need during this time.\u201d\nJudith Blake, chair of the Local Government Association\u2019s children and young people board, said councils were working with schools, pupils and their families to encourage vulnerable children to attend school. \u201cUnderstandably, many families are concerned for the health of their children and other family members if they attend school, so councils are working with them to provide reassurance,\u201d she said.\nThe Department for Education said powers enabled by the Coronavirus Act would allow social workers who have recently left the profession to return to work, including those who have retired, without any negative repercussions to their pensions. Meanwhile, Social Work England has launched a drive to bring up to 8,000 former practitioners back into the profession to deal with the impact of Covid-19 on the workforce.\nChildren and families minister Vicky Ford said government had also given local authorities \u00a31.6bn to help deal with coronavirus, including to spend on social care. \u201cSocial workers are supporting thousands of families and vulnerable children through these uncertain times and we need to ensure that there is a continuity of care,\u201d she said.",

Try and shop just once a week \u2013 just, you know, just do the essentials not everything else.\u201d\nHowever, Downing Street corrected Shapps, saying that the advice on people leaving home was clear and did not set a specific limit on how often they could do so for shopping.\nThe prime minister\u2019s official spokesman said: \u201cThe guidance does not specify that, no. The guidance says it should be \u2018as infrequent as possible\u2019.\u201d\nFor some people \u201ctheir judgment will be that that will be once a week, but it\u2019s not what the guidance specifies,\u201d he said.\nShapps is not the first cabinet minister to give their own interpretation of the guidance.

Because at this time of empathy and shared fears it\u2019s heartening, in some way, to know that in some places life goes on.\nA growing feature of this shutdown is the willingness of footballers to offer Q&A sessions, presumably while squat-thrusting in their private gyms. With press officers and Mr 15%s now merely voices on the end of a Zoom call, off come the shackles \u2013 like Karim Benzema, who\u2019s decided the time is right to appraise the skills of Olivier Giroud, a man who, one might assume, is taking his old place in Les Bleus\u2019 lineup. \u201cYou can\u2019t confuse an F1 car with a go-kart and I\u2019m being kind,\u201d he tooted in a live Instachat video with some YouTuber or whatever. \u201cHe has his career, he does what he wants and scores the goals he wants to score. He\u2019s in his corner and I\u2019m in mine. If we\u2019re talking about playing style, his suits France well.\u201d\nHe launched into a slightly kinder explanation of the ways in which Giroud frees up space for Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 and Antoine Griezmann, before finding himself unable to resist with a closing \u201cbut does everyone like his game?

That\u2019s what I think, that\u2019s the truth, and that\u2019s how it is. Because, if you ask me with R9 [Ronaldo]: R9 is F1, and I am karting. That\u2019s the way it is. We\u2019re going to move on.\u201d\nNot until The Fiver has had its pound of flesh, Karim. You might want to have a little think about the last time a go-kart won a World Cup. Or watch one of those interviews where F1 drivers take time out from going round in circles in the most intricately-computed machines and admit that they\u2019d give anything for just one more day back in the old wagon they careered around in as kids, where it all began. Just like the selfish louts next door, we\u2019re all into whatever we\u2019re into.

Play all remaining fixtures on the same day. Each is a five-a-side game of five minutes each way. The matches can be played on an artificial surface, say at The Pitts in Ancoats. Clubs can send a squad of seven, one of whom is the captain/coach. Goalies must stay inside their area, etc. Drinks in the bar afterwards.

Make it best-of-20, every outfield player takes a shot, with discrepancies in the final scores going towards goal difference.

        "content": "Film director who made his name with the 1980s cult horror classic Re-Animator\nHorror movies don\u2019t come much gorier, funnier or more outre than Re-Animator (1985), the HP Lovecraft adaptation that brought acclaim and infamy to Stuart Gordon, who has died aged 72 from multiple organ failure. The film, which marked his cinematic debut after many years at the forefront of experimental, cutting-edge theatre, concerned the medical student Herbert West (Jeffrey Combs), who concocts a DayGlo serum to reanimate dead tissue, only for the revived corpses to wreak havoc.\nThe acting was commendably straight-faced with hints of camp, the violence graphic, gooey and over-the-top: \u201cThe main thing I remember about shooting Re-Animator is that my shoes stuck to the floor the whole time,\u201d Gordon recalled. In an unequivocal rave review for the New Yorker, Pauline Kael said: \u201cYou laugh out loud, and as the ghoulish jokes escalate you feel revivified \u2013light-headed and happy \u2026 the bloodier it gets, the funnier it is.\u201d\nNot everyone agreed. Re-Animator led Gordon into the first of several contretemps with the censors. The picture was released in the US without a rating from the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA); Gordon realised that \u201cif we cut it to their standards the movie would be about 15 minutes long\u201d. In the UK, a measure of the picture\u2019s gruesomeness can be found in the various snips, almost two minutes\u2019 worth in total, which were insisted on by the British Board of Film Classification before it would grant the 18 certificate necessary for public exhibition: the board instructed Gordon to \u201creduce sight of blood flowing down naked body as boy drives surgical saw into man\u2019s neck\u201d, \u201creduce sight of bloody head being squeezed and blood gushing from it\u201d and \u201cremove sight \u2026 of doctor\u2019s severed head attempting oral sex\u201d.\nGordon argued that there was serious intent behind the shock value of the latter spectacle. \u201cIt had occurred to me while watching horror films that there would always be that scene where the monster would drag the woman off with him and then the camera would cut, and you\u2019re left there wondering, \u2018Well, what\u2019s he going to do with her?\u2019 \u2026 These re-animated people would have their libidos fully unleashed, and that\u2019s part of the \u2018problem\u2019, that they\u2019re not being held back by social constructs and values.\u201d\nThe censors sharpened their scissors once again for Gordon\u2019s second Lovecraft adaptation, From Beyond (1986), on which the special effects team reportedly got through 160 gallons of gunk. \u201cWe thought we were so clever because instead of using blood we just had a lot of slime and goo, but the MPAA said that was even more disgusting!\u201d In this instance, he was contractually obliged in the US to secure an R rating (allowing viewers under 17 to be admitted with an adult), which resulted in some delicate behind-the-scenes conversations. \u201cWhat on earth were you thinking of when you zoomed in on his mouth as he was sucking out her eye?\u201d asked an MPAA representative. \u201cI didn\u2019t even tell her that the woman on screen was my wife and that it wasn\u2019t very pleasant for her either,\u201d Gordon later confessed. \u201cBut if your wife won\u2019t put up with it, who will?\u201d\nHis propensity for horror and outrage made it all the more unexpected when he co-created the hit Disney comedy Honey, I Shrunk the Kids (1989), though he did not consider the project a radical departure. \u201cReally, it\u2019s no different than Re-Animator,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about a mad scientist and an experiment that goes wrong, and so forth.\u201d The picture was a response to his children\u2019s complaints that they weren\u2019t allowed to see any of his work. Gordon was set to direct the movie until illness on the eve of production forced him to step down.\nBorn in Chicago, Stuart was the son of Bernard, a factory supervisor, and Rosalie (nee Sabath), a teacher. He was educated at Lane technical high school before attending the University of Wisconsin. It was there in 1968 that he formed the Screw Theatre, which mounted several controversial productions. The most harrowing was The Game Show, intended as an attack on complacency, during which the auditorium doors were locked and members of the audience (who were, in fact, plants) humiliated and brutalised. After a version of Peter Pan incorporating nudity, anti-war sentiments and psychedelic overtones, he and his future wife, Carolyn Purdy (later Purdy-Gordon), were arrested on charges of obscenity.\nThe following year they co-founded the influential Organic Theatre Company, where Gordon directed new plays including the world premiere in 1974 of David Mamet\u2019s savage dating comedy Sexual Perversity in Chicago, and Bleacher Bums, a comedy drama about baseball fans written in 1977 by Organic regulars including Gordon, Purdy-Gordon and the actors Joe Mantegna and Dennis Franz, and described by the Chicago Tribune as \u201cBeckettian\u201d.\nThere was already a cinematic quality to Gordon\u2019s theatre work. \u201cStuart\u2019s notion was that anything which could be done on film could be done on the stage,\u201d said Mamet, \u201cso he created, play-by-play, a stagecraft of effect: blood, gore, nudity, music, sound, and so on. It thrilled us all, production by production. We who saw the shows remember them still.\u201d\nBut when he moved into directing films, he retained elements of the theatrical process, often drawing on a small repertory company of actors (including Combs, who described him as \u201cthe Ozzy Osbourne of directors\u201d) and ring-fencing the sort of generous rehearsal period uncommon in filmmaking. Among his other movies were two further Lovecraft adaptations, Castle Freak (1995) and Dagon (2001), as well as the boisterous, irreverent adventure Space Truckers (1996), starring Stephen Dorff and Dennis Hopper. In 2005, he filmed Mamet\u2019s 1982 play Edmond, with William H Macy as the white-collar worker who surrenders to his murderous impulses.\nGordon returned to theatre in recent years, directing in 2011 the ambitious and necessarily messy Re-Animator: The Musical. Audience members in the first three rows \u2013 the \u201csplatter zone\u201d \u2013 were provided with plastic ponchos; the Hollywood Reporter said the show exhibited \u201cthe same brio as a verismo opera\u201d.\nThe bold creative philosophy of Gordon\u2019s earliest theatrical experiments remained intact throughout his career. \u201cThere is a side of me that likes to break through cliches and wake people up,\u201d he said in 1986. \u201cI find that fun. I think that\u2019s part of what art is supposed to do \u2013 to make you see or experience things in ways that you haven\u2019t before.\u201d\nHe is survived by Carolyn and their three daughters, Suzanna, Jillian and Margaret, as well as four grandchildren.\n Stuart Gordon, film and stage director, born 11 August 1947; died 24 March 2020",

        "content": "Elderly and vulnerable people on the stresses of the crisis while receiving no contact from the government\nUp to 1.5 million people with severe health conditions including some cancers, cystic fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have been told to self-isolate by the government because they are at a much greater risk from coronavirus.\nFree food parcels are being sent out to those who cannot access supplies but there are fears people in need have been missed off the list and that the government has underestimated food insecurity in the UK \u2013 leaving many feeling helpless.\nSelf-isolating elderly and vulnerable people have told of the stresses of shielding themselves from coronavirus while receiving no contact from the government.\nI don\u2019t usually ask for much help, I live alone and just get on with it. I don\u2019t expect miracles but I do feel if the government is telling me to stay indoors for three months then they have to help me. I have refractory celiac disease \u2013 a serious autoimmune condition \u2013 heart problems and asthma. My doctor said I am high priority and I have registered with the government on the website, but they did not get back to me so I did it again: it\u2019s very frustrating. The supermarket said I cannot get priority for delivery till hearing from the government and I\u2019ve only got enough food for the next few days. I would like to live a bit longer, wouldn\u2019t everybody?\nThe vulnerable were told to expect letters telling them what to do 10 days ago but we are still listening for the postman. As an 87-year-old cancer and open heart surgery survivor, and the sole carer for a 79-year-old triple cancer sufferer currently undergoing treatment, we are also finding it impossible to get online deliveries from supermarkets. They are in disarray, and a little more official sympathy would not go amiss. We can\u2019t expose ourselves to the virus.\nI have dermatitis herpetiforme and autoimmune restated condition, and I had a heart attack 11 years ago after my husband died. I live in a retirement block where I am self-isolating. I kept ringing the supermarkets to see if I could get a delivery but they said to contact the government and see if I could qualify for a priority home delivery slot. I filled in a lengthy form which asked whether I had any of a long list of medical conditions, and I had to say no. So I have been forced to rely on family members \u2013 who are themselves trying to isolate for various reasons \u2013 for shopping.\nI thought I would automatically be on the \u201cat risk\u201d list as an 82-year-old former RAF engineer with a heart condition who is waiting for a bladder cancer operation and has limited mobility. I tried to make a supermarket order but an automated response said they hadn\u2019t received the government list yet, while another shop said I wasn\u2019t on it. I doubt that I am the only person who slipped through the net and it looked like I might have to chance my luck and go shopping until Sainsbury\u2019s eventually told me I fulfilled their criteria for a delivery\nI have one good lung and severe asthma, and sometimes I have large ulcers on my legs and arms. These food sites have a log-on if you\u2019re old and on your own, but why ask if they\u2019re all full up for deliveries? Why don\u2019t the government get more vans to deliver to people if they want people to stay inside? Where are the volunteers?\nI signed up on the government site, pressed the final button, and they said they would get in touch by email or phone but they haven\u2019t. They\u2019re too busy with other things, aren\u2019t they. There is a food shop not far from mine so I get the bus when there\u2019s no one about. We like to not rely on other people like we should do. We\u2019re used to it, so I\u2019m just doing what I\u2019ve always done, I\u2019ve never had help in the past.\nIt\u2019s strange that somebody like me with a full-time oxygen supply who has to self-isolate still has not received a letter from the NHS. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s just a blip in the system but for others it must be very worrying. I also filled out the government form last Monday but there wasn\u2019t even an automatic response to say we\u2019ve got your application like almost everything you subscribe to these days. It would be so simple to set up. It leaves a lot of asking why we haven\u2019t been sent a letter or that we are being considered for this list; my daughter is supplying me with stuff, but where am I if things really do go wrong?\nSome names were changed.",

        "content": "Doctors say nurseries closing with no notice during coronavirus lockdown\nFrontline NHS medical staff with young children are increasingly concerned that unexpected nursery closures are making it difficult for them to work.\nMany doctors are reporting that because nurseries are closing with little or no notice or dramatically reducing their hours, they are finding it hard to find people to look after their children.\nThe details of a growing childcare crisis for key workers emerged as the Royal College of Physicians reveals that one in four hospital doctors is off work, either because they are ill or in quarantine.\nIn an attempt to alleviate the pressure the Home Office has announced that nearly 3,000 migrant doctors, nurses and paramedics plus their family members are to have their visas extended for a year. The extension, which is free of charge, will apply to about 2,800 NHS staff whose visa is due to expire before 1 October.\nSeveral doctors said nursery staff had admitted they were so frightened of caring for the children of frontline NHS workers that they had decided to stop working. Others said nurseries had closed quickly after the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, outlined furloughing arrangements for paying staff 80% of their salary.\nMany NHS staff said they had been told they should not drop children at nursery the morning after a nightshift, as they would be at home and should be able to care for them themselves. This meant they were unable to sleep between shifts.\nA number of health workers said they had had to reduce their hours or cancel shifts as a result of these problems. \u201cI really want to help at this difficult time, but its seems like childcare is failing us. I have already reduced my hours, as after school clubs are not open,\u201d Najma Anwar, a hospital doctor, told the Guardian.\n\u201cMy heart is breaking that the nation clapped on its streets for us, and yet won\u2019t care for our children so we can continue to take ourselves to hospital to work to care for their families,\u201d one doctor, who asked not to be named, wrote in an email.\nA survey of more than 6,000 childminders and other childcare providers in England and Wales, by the Professional Association for Childcare and Early Years, conducted during the first week of the government official closure of all schools and childcare settings, revealed that 46% had closed for the foreseeable future due to coronavirus.\nOf those, one in five made the decision because they were concerned about their health and that of their staff. There are no official figures for closures because providers are not currently required to report closures due to coronavirus to Ofsted.\nNursery staff said their position was very difficult. Purnima Tanuku, the chief executive of the National Day Nurseries Association, said: \u201cThese dedicated practitioners are going to work every day knowing that very young children are unable to understand social distancing. They have little or no protective equipment and many are paid minimum wages or just above.\n\u201cMany nurseries are managing to stay open despite all the challenges of having very little income and juggling staffing rotas. We have members who are running at losses of almost \u00a31,000 a week to provide care for the small number of children they have. They deserve credit as their staff are risking their own health going to work so that doctors, nurses and other key workers can do their crucial jobs.\u201d\nNatalie Huntingdon, who runs a nursery in Yorkshire, said: \u201cWe are expecting staff to work in high risk situations, caring for the children of frontline workers. If a one-year-old whose parents are doctors and working with Covid-19 parents needs a cuddle, we cannot social distance. The chances of illness are huge.\u201d\nCheryl Hadland, who owns 30 nurseries on the south coast, six of them near hospitals, said: \u201cThe majority of my staff want to do their bit to help the NHS, but there is a lot of fear. They are being asked to put themselves on the frontline, working with children of NHS workers, with no masks and no protective equipment, paid at least half what a nurse is paid, let alone a doctor. You can understand why fear might make people want to stay at home and protect their own families.\u201d\nSeveral doctors across the UK, who originally outlined their problems on a doctors\u2019 parenting Facebook group, said they were being asked to pay full fees, even after the nursery had closed, so that it could continue as a business once the crisis is over.\nOne doctor said she and her husband, who both work in an NHS hospital in acute and emergency roles, have had to hire a nanny because their nursery could not guarantee it would remain open. \u201cNow we have to pay the additional massive cost of a nanny to cover childcare,\u201d she said.\nDoctors said these difficulties were having an impact on staffing at hospitals and GP practices. \u201cPeople have had nurseries close at lunchtime and had to cancel a shift the next day as they hadn\u2019t had any notice,\u201d one said\nThe abruptness of the closures has made things particularly difficult for medical staff, who are already under pressure at work. \u201cOur nursery is next to the hospital and told us last week that they wouldn\u2019t close as 80% of children attending have parents that are key workers. They closed at the end of last week,\u201d one GP said, adding that she was obliged to continue paying half-fees to retain a place for the future, and was simultaneously paying for alternative emergency childcare.\nSarah Jeffery, another frontline doctor was told on Friday that her nursery would remain open for key workers. \u201cThen on Monday afternoon they emailed that they were closing. They offered no real explanation, no apology and no alternative options,\u201d she said.\nNeil Leitch, the chief executive of the Early Years Alliance, said: \u201cWe know that for key workers reliant on childcare to be able to continue to work, the temporary closure of their nursery, pre-school or childminder is deeply concerning.\n\u201cUnfortunately, more and more childcare providers are having to take the extremely difficult decision to close, either because a loss of staff through self-isolation or sickness has made staying open impossible, or increasingly, because a sharp fall in the number of children attending has made doing so completely unviable.\u201d",

The Czech Republic and Slovakia have also just made masks mandatory.\nOn Tuesday, the eastern city of Jena became the first German municipality to order mask use in shops and on public transport, though authorities are encouraging people to sew their own, or wear a protective cloth, rather than seek out medical masks which are in short supply.\nThe German health minister, Jens Spahn, said he saw no reason to oblige people to wear masks, \u201cbut I recognise the growing willingness of people to wear masks out of solidarity for other people\u201d.\nWinfried Kretschmann, the premier of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, which is one of the worst-hit states in Germany, said he supported the idea of home-sewn masks, and would raise the subject at a meeting of state leaders with Angela Merkel on Wednesday. \u201cAt the very least they serve as spit protectors, reducing the risk of infecting fellow citizens through passing on the droplets,\u201d he said.\nIt is thought that as the number of confirmed infections continues to rise across Europe, people could soon be following the example of many east Asians in their use of face masks.\nEarlier this week, the head of the German association of supermarkets, Nils Busch-Petersen, appealed to shoppers to wear masks, or some form of mouth and nose protection, for the safety of workers, who he said needed to know that shoppers were making an effort to keep them safe. German supermarkets have already taken measures such as putting cashiers behind perspex windows and employing a person at the entrance to disinfect every supermarket trolley.\n\u201cThe more people who wear [masks] voluntarily, the more they are protecting others,\u201d Busch-Petersen said.\nAcross the country, people are making masks at home, using instructions from the internet.\nCostume makers employed by now-closed opera houses have also started making medically approved masks for doctors and nurses. Some hospitals have issued local appeals for donations of cotton masks that can be washed at 90C.\nThe World Health Organization has however sounded a note of warning, saying that the wearing of masks by anyone other than at-risk groups can pose more of an infection risk than not wearing them.\nMichael Ryan, the head of its health emergencies programme, said this week that wearing a mask can provide a false sense of security and divert attention from hygiene measures, such as handwashing. Touching the outside of the mask can also make it less effective.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t generally recommend the wearing of masks in public by otherwise well individuals because it has not up to now been associated with any particular benefit,\u201d Ryan said.\nHe stressed however that the WHO does recommend the wearing of masks by people with Covid-19 to prevent its spread, by home caregivers tending those who are sick, and by those on the frontline, such as nurses and doctors.\nA leading voice on medical matters in Germany, the Social Democrats\u2019 health expert, Karl Lauterbach, said the benefits of masks were \u201cgrossly underestimated\u201d and encouraged their use, \u201con condition that there are enough masks and that medical personnel are not missing out on them as a result\u201d.\nThe World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.\nThe UN agency\u00a0advises\u00a0people to:\nMany countries are now enforcing or recommending curfews or lockdowns. Check with your local authorities for up-to-date information about the situation in your area.\u00a0\nIn the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should\u00a0stay at home for at least 7 days.\nIf you live with other people,\u00a0they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.\nLothar Wieler, the president of the Robert Koch Institute, the government\u2019s main public health advisory body, said on Tuesday a distinction had to be made between mouth and nose protection and the filtering facepieces worn by medical personnel, which hold viruses back.\n\u201cMouth-nose protection serves to protect other people, so that if you as the wearer are infected yourself and you cough or sneeze, the droplets don\u2019t travel so far, which makes sense,\u201d Wieler said. \u201cWe recommended it from the very start [of the outbreak] and continue to do so.\u201d\nHe said people wearing face protection were also less likely to touch their faces.\nIncreasing numbers are catching on to what has already become a trend, particularly among celebrities. Some designers have taken up the challenge and are making masks with catchy patterns and designs.",

        "content": "Police not seeking anyone else in connection with deaths of Needham family in Sussex\nA murder investigation has been launched after a family of four and their dog were found dead in a West Sussex village.\nThe bodies of a man, his partner and their two young daughters, were discovered at a house in Woodmancote, near Chichester.\nSussex police named them as Robert Needham, 42, Kelly Fitzgibbons, 40, Ava Needham, four, and two-year-old Lexi Needham.\nOfficers attended the property in Duffield Lane at about 6.45pm on Sunday after receiving a call raising concerns for the welfare of the residents.\nWhen they arrived, they found four bodies. Police said they were treating the incident as a murder investigation but detectives were not looking for anyone else in connection with the deaths.\nThe family were seen at the end of last week taking their daily exercise in the fields around their home.\nCh Supt Jerry Westerman said: \u201cThis is believed to be an isolated incident contained to one property and in these early stages of the investigation we are not seeking anyone else in connection with the incident.\u201d\nResidents of the village were told they could expect to see a heightened police presence in the area.\nRobert Needham had been building an extension for the family after moving back to his mother Maureen Needham\u2019s home.\nDouglas Meany, a neighbour, said he had known the Needham family for 40 years and often drove Maureen, 77, to the doctor\u2019s surgery.\n\u201cI\u2019ve known the family a very long time. We got on well as neighbours. As far as I know they were a fairly close-knit family, just normal, but not in each other\u2019s pockets,\u201d he said.\n\u201cFor a while the house was used as a care home the family ran. Previous to that, Maureen and her husband used to run a village shop.\n\u201cOn Sunday, I was alerted to the fact there was a lot of activity in the lane outside. I saw two paramedic vehicles, unmarked police cars in the lane as well as marked. That carried on right through the night, comings and goings, and forensics seemed to arrive at around midnight.\n\u201cAs there was more police and paramedics involved, we knew that somebody was in trouble, then it came to light that there may have been fatalities and there might have been more than one.\u201d\nTwo days before the incident, Kelly Fitzgibbons posted on social media pictures of Robert and her children on their \u201cwalk for the day\u201d during the coronavirus lockdown.\nMeany said: \u201cThere was no evidence previously that there was a problem. Robert was building an extension for the family to live in, but while he was building it he wasn\u2019t getting an income from any other building work.\n\u201cI think Robert and Kelly and the children tended to stay in a section of the house and Maureen stayed in another section. Maureen has relatives in Manchester and near London and she does spend time with them. I don\u2019t know where she is.\u201d\nOn Facebook on Tuesday, Maureen said: \u201cIt was Robert, Kelly and my lovely grandchildren that all died upstairs.\u201d\nAnother resident, Ian Richardson, said it was a close community and the neighbourhood was considered a low-crime area.\nHe added: \u201cI have tried to put it into context and think it\u2019s something that happens all over the place.\u201d\nA Home Office pathologist will try to determine how the family died.\nAnyone with any information is asked to contact Sussex police on 101, quoting Operation Cotton.\nIn the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or by emailing jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

        "content": "Recruits to coronavirus appeal may end up owing tax, interest and fees, warns HMRC\nFormer workers returning to the NHS are being targeted with aggressive tax avoidance schemes \u2013 under the guise of umbrella companies \u2013 which HMRC warns are unscrupulous and could leave people owing more tax.\nAbout 20,000 former NHS staff have returned to work to help the fight against coronavirus, Boris Johnson said at the weekend. But tax avoidance scheme promoters have approached many, offering the false hope that they will be able to take home 80% to 85% of their pay.\nHMRC said: \u201cIf you are returning to work for the NHS, HMRC is warning you to be very careful not to sign up to these schemes, which HMRC considers to be tax avoidance.\u201d\nOften in such cases an employment agency will recommend that the worker goes through an umbrella company, which in effect employs them. It pays the worker a minimum wage, then makes a second payment, which it claims is not taxable \u2013 such as a loan, a capital advance or credit facility.\n\u201cAll of these schemes have one thing in common, and that is to attempt to disguise the true level of your earnings, which would ordinarily be subject to income tax and national insurance contributions,\u201d said HMRC.\nAnyone asked to sign documents putting them on to the payroll of an umbrella company should think very carefully before signing up. \u201cThese schemes are very likely to involve tax avoidance and you could end up owing tax and interest, as well as incurring the fees paid to the umbrella company,\u201d said HMRC.\nUmbrella companies have proved a thorn in the side of HMRC for years, with schemes frequently promoted in the IT and construction industry. Unions have also campaigned against them.\nIn 2014, the TUC general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, called the practices of some umbrella companies \u201cblatant tax dodging\u201d and said they were engaged in \u201ccynical attempts to evade pension responsibilities\u201d. The trade union Unite also called on the NHS to outlaw umbrella companies operating throughout the service, calling them \u201cparasites feasting off workers\u2019 wages\u201d.\nMainstream accountancy firms say they are surprised that the schemes are still so heavily promoted despite HMRC warnings. Fiona Fernie, a tax dispute resolution partner at Blick Rothenberg said: \u201cSuch schemes have been used for a number of years in other sectors, including the construction and IT industries, and HMRC have been advising that they do not work and constitute tax avoidance.\n\u201cIt is astonishing that after such a prolonged attack on these arrangements by HMRC, returning NHS workers are now being targeted to use them by the scheme promoters. It is also of particular concern that the main targets are individuals who are unlikely to have experience which would warn them of the dangers of these schemes and who are going out of their way to be good citizens.\u201d",

        "content": "Hungary\u2019s PM insists extreme measures are only to fight the pandemic, others are not so sure\nThe coronavirus has already overwhelmed medical services, grounded flights and halted economic growth, but one of its most enduring effects could be to usher in a political age in which soft authoritarians have turned harder, and the surveillance state becomes a way of life even in some democracies.\nIn Hungary, after a set of measures introduced on Monday, it is now a criminal offence to spread misinformation about coronavirus, and the prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, can rule by decree for an indefinite period. In neighbouring Serbia, soldiers patrol the streets as part of the coronavirus response plan. In Moscow, authorities are reportedly mulling measures that would require everyone who wants to go outside to submit the reasons online, and then be tracked via their smartphones.\nBy now, most countries across the world have introduced some form of extraordinary measures to battle coronavirus, and even many democratic governments have faced little dissent over changes that in normal times would have been met with months or years of furious parliamentary debate. But what happens when the pandemic is over?\n\u201cExtraordinary legal situations are very easy to introduce, but it is much harder to return to business as usual afterwards,\u201d said the Budapest-based thinktank Political Capital in response to the Hungarian measures. The sentiment could be equally applicable elsewhere.\nThe Hungarian government, which in the decade since Orb\u00e1n took over has been accused of rolling back freedoms and democratic norms, has insisted that its measures are purely about fighting the coronavirus, and Orb\u00e1n\u2019s spokesman has dismissed criticism of them as \u201cfake news\u201d.\nBut the country\u2019s beleaguered opposition says it offered to agree to everything, in the spirit of national unity, but merely asked for a time-based renewal clause to be placed on the measures. None was forthcoming.\nIvan Krastev, a Bulgarian political scientist who has written extensively on European political shifts, referred to the Hungarian law as \u201ca kind of authoritarian entrepreneurship\u201d, comparing it to people selling masks and other equipment at inflated prices. Orb\u00e1n, he said, is experimenting with what might be possible in this sudden new reality. \u201cHe\u2019s trying and testing, to see what the market will take.\u201d\nWhile Orb\u00e1n is a leader flying high who has sought to push the boundaries even further, in Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu has looked to use the situation to ease himself out of a sticky spot. Despite having failed three times to form a government in the past year, he is now in talks with his rival, Benny Gantz, to agree on a deal for him to remain prime minister for at least the next two years. Additionally, Netanyahu\u2019s trial on charges of bribery and fraud has also been delayed for two months because of the state of emergency.\nAt a time when even stepping outside could be dangerous, mass protests against government moves are a non-starter, and international criticism is not likely to be robust given other leaders are occupied with combating the crises in their own countries.\nAdditionally, citizens may feel more willing to give governments the benefit of the doubt in the current circumstances, preferring an entrenching of the status quo to weak or divided government.\nKrastev compared the current crisis to the financial crisis of 2008 and the migration crisis of 2015, and said that while then the responses in Europe were driven by anxiety, this time the dominant emotion is fear, which is much more direct. \u201cThis makes people ready to tolerate everything, because when the danger is everywhere, you believe only the government can help you,\u201d he said.\nThe terrifying situation in which anyone, anywhere, can be a potential threat is a perfect mobilising force for authoritarians, and many have explicitly compared the current situation to a state of war, applying military terminology to civilian life, and implying that the kind of restrictions applicable in wartime, when questioning the government could be seen as unpatriotic or even traitorous, should now apply.\n\u201cJust as in wartime, a state of emergency could extend until the end of hostilities. Today, we confront not a military power but are in a war-like state to defend our people against a pandemic the likes of which we have not seen in a century,\u201d said Orb\u00e1n\u2019s spokesman Zolt\u00e1n Kov\u00e1cs earlier this week, defending the Hungarian measures.\nOpponents, predictably, were cast as indifferent to saving the lives of Hungarians, while Kov\u00e1cs also said it was logical to introduce jail terms for spreading false rumours. He said the new law only covers those who intentionally spread fake information that hampers the government response to coronavirus. How those judgments are made is a big question; however, given that Kov\u00e1cs and others in the government regularly accuse journalists reporting critically on the government of deliberately spreading lies.\nMeasures reportedly being mulled in Moscow would bring Russia a step closer to the Chinese model of surveillance, but it is not just Vladimir Putin who may soon be keeping a closer eye on his citizens. Throughout Europe, policymakers are wondering how best to monitor the population, especially if in the not-too-distant future lockdowns can be carefully eased. Once surveillance measures are brought in for the coronavirus, it may be hard to argue against keeping them in place for hypothetical future threats.\nJust how many of the \u201cextraordinary\u201d measures introduced now will stick around to shape our world over the next years and decades will partly depend on how severe and how long-lasting the medical situation turns out to be, and how various governments\u2019 responses to the pandemic look in retrospect.\n\u201cIf in the end, people have the feeling they were manipulated then maybe we will see resistance to all these measures. But at this stage I see much more acceptance than resistance,\u201d said Krastev.",

Grant Shapps said the government had so far helped more than 160,000 Britons get home from Spain, Morocco and Cyprus via commercial airlines.\nThe scale of the rescue task emerged as one of the charter companies hired by the German government said it had offered assistance to the UK but that the Foreign Office had not returned its calls.\nAir Charter Service, which helped organise flights following the collapse of Thomas Cook and Monarch airlines, told the Guardian that it had been hired by France, the Netherlands, the US and Germany in the past nine days but had not had any contact from the UK.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve worked with the FCO [Foreign and Commonwealth Office] before but they are just not returning our calls,\u201d said Matthew Purton, head of commercial aviation, adding that he was surprised the UK government had not been in touch.\nPurton said his company had flown to the Philippines, Bolivia and Cuba to repatriate 4,000 Germans in the past nine days.\n\u201cWhat the FCO is doing now is great and you have to give them credit because they are trying to rescue some people from places which are diplomatically sensitive and where we do not have very good diplomatic relations, but that is where a diplomatic solution is called for, but we are there ready and waiting for their calls and can do anything from 19-seater planes to Airbus A380s,\u201d he said.\nRaab said on Monday the UK would charter flights where commercial options were not available. Shapps acknowledged the efforts of Germany, but said the UK had a far greater challenge on its hands with up to 750,000 people initially stranded.\nThis compares to the 200,000 German nationals hit by the travel lockdowns, of which around 50,000 were stranded. Shapps said that so far more than 160,000 Britons have been able to get home from Spain, Morocco and Cyprus via commercial airlines.\nIn India, where commercial flights have been grounded for at least a week, dozens of Britons are believed to be among more than 2,100 travellers rescued by the German embassy using specially chartered aircraft.\nChris Linford, 56, a cafe owner from Derbyshire, said he and his family were among a group of about 40 British tourists on a German flight from Delhi to Frankfurt on Friday. On Tuesday, he praised the German government for their \u201cunbelievable\u201d repatriation effort and accused the UK of being missing in action.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t get through to anyone at the British embassy in Delhi \u2013 we spent about \u00a3120 trying to get through to them and the last we heard was \u2018be patient\u2019,\u201d he said.\nLinford said he and his family were told to wait at the German ambassador\u2019s residence in Delhi on Friday, where they were provided with food and water before being escorted under armed guard in 12 coaches to the airport. The 1,000 passengers \u2013 most of whom were German nationals, with about 250 other EU citizens \u2013 then boarded a Lufthansa flight to Frankfurt.\nLinford said they were not charged for the flight as German officials said they would seek to recoup the air fare from the UK government. \u201cEverybody was thankful of the Germans,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s only us that aren\u2019t repatriating people. We\u2019re just incompetent. We were the only nationality left at our hostel \u2013 every other country had been flown home,\u201d he added.\nOur German friends are at it again \ud83c\udde9\ud83c\uddea\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\u2708\ufe0f\ud83c\udfe1They\u2019ve opened 40 places on a flight for \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddfa&\ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7 citizens leaving Jakarta on Friday 3 April at 17.25, arriving in Frankfurt on Sat 4 April at 05.35. Cost = regular economy ticket Contact us if you are \ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7 & want to be on that plane \u2708\ufe0f\nLinford said his family had spent more than \u00a34,000 on three flights that were cancelled when India grounded all commercial flights on 24 March.\nThe German government has 1,000 members of staff working on the repatriation effort at its foreign office. Its embassy in London said it had chartered planes directly for 43 countries, with the remainder getting home on 17 rescue flights organised by other EU member states.\nThe UK ambassador in Indonesia revealed it had been offered 40 seats on a flight out of Jakarta to Frankfurt. \u201cOur German friends are at it again,\u201d the British embassy in Jakarta said on Twitter. \u201cThey\u2019ve opened 40 places on Friday 3 April at 17.25,\u201d it tweeted, adding that the cost would be \u201cregular economy\u201d.",

Controls remain in place for a number of key lines including antibacterial hand sanitiser, toilet paper and long-life milk.\n\u201cWhile we would still encourage people to buy only what they need, product availability in store is good and the move will make it easier for people to shop for vulnerable people and those who are self-isolating,\u201d the retailer said.\nThe Bradford-based Morrisons chain has increased the purchase limit on products from three to four, and removed them altogether on some products.The changes would make it easier for people to donate to food banks, it said. It is estimated that the outbreak of Covid-19 has led to a 40% reduction in donations to community food banks across the country, when most are experiencing soaring demand for their services.\nWaitrose also said it was no longer restricting the quantity of fresh food, including meat, poultry and ready meals, that people could buy. Caps remain in place for other products, including toilet paper, in its stores and on its website. M&S said it was starting to stock some brands, such as Tilda rice, to boost availability.\nTesco, which recently limited online shoppers to buying 80 items at a time, said its home-shopping service had been scaled up and could now handle 780,000 orders each week for either home delivery or click & collect.\nThat compares with 660,000 slots a fortnight ago, with the UK\u2019s biggest supermarket planning to add another 100,000 spaces in the coming weeks.\nThe supermarket has bolstered the delivery slots by hiring 7,500 van drivers and product pickers. Its in-store limit of three items per customer on every product line remains in place.\nThe chief executive, Dave Lewis, said: \u201cWe\u2019re doing everything we can to increase the number of slots available and to support vulnerable people. We\u2019ll expand the number of slots available each week but this still isn\u2019t enough to meet the demand. For this reason, it is vital that customers who can come into stores and shop for themselves do so.\u201d\nThe update came as Lewis announced a \u00a330m package of support for community groups, including food banks and charities, that were \u201creally under pressure\u201d.\nThe sum includes \u00a315m of food donations to the redistribution charity FareShare and the anti-poverty campaign the Trussell Trust over the next 12 weeks.",

        "content": "Technology is nearly ready for use and would also tell people when they should self-isolate\nThe NHS is in talks to roll out a smartphone app that instantly traces close contacts of people carrying the coronavirus and advises them to self-isolate.\nThe app, developed by NHSX \u2013 the health service\u2019s digital transformation arm \u2013 with academic and industry partners is in advanced stages of evaluation and is weeks away from being ready to be deployed, the Guardian understands.\nAround 60% of the adult population would need to sign up and engage with the app by registering their symptoms or positive test results for it to be effective. Their proximity to other users would be logged, and they would follow advice given in alerts to self-isolate \u2013 even in cases where they were not aware of having been in contact with someone infected.\nThe prospect of an app that would give the government access to health and location data has already triggered privacy concerns and would herald an unprecedented level of surveillance.\nHowever, digital contact tracing has been a central part of the containment strategy in China and, according to a new analysis by scientists at the University of Oxford, \u201cdigital herd protection\u201d is likely to be crucial in order to lift current restrictions without seeing a huge resurgence of infections.\n\u201cWe see it as the only alternative to \u2026 applying isolation to the whole population,\u201d said Prof David Bonsall, senior researcher at Oxford University\u2019s Nuffield Department of Medicine and a clinician, who co-led the project. \u201cWe think it\u2019s going to be a very important part of that strategy.\u201d The Oxford team developed an algorithm for the app.\n\u201cThat\u2019s where this concept of herd protection came from,\u201d said Bonsall. \u201cYou can protect the vulnerable people in society who may not have smartphones, and protect children. If enough adults across the population engage with the system and trust the system telling them they should isolate, you\u2019re protecting all those individuals who don\u2019t have a device.\u201d\nUnlike with some previous pandemics, including Sars and flu, a high proportion of transmission of Covid-19 occurs before a person is showing symptoms. So isolating people once they become ill and tracing contacts manually has limited effectiveness because the spread of the virus will be one step ahead, according to the team\u2019s analysis in the journal Science.\n\u201cTraditional contact tracing is too slow for this virus and it won\u2019t work,\u201d said Bonsall. \u201cBy the time you\u2019ve identified the contact, they\u2019ve already transmitted. It doesn\u2019t scale either.\u201d\nThe team has been working on the algorithm since mid-January and has studied the Chinese app that gives people a red or green code determining whether they need to self-isolate.\nThe app would not need to access location data, but could log users\u2019 proximity to each other through Bluetooth. Once a user reports symptoms or a positive test result, the app would trace back through close contacts over the past seven days and alert those calculated to be at risk. Once deployed, developers would use data on who is actually infected to optimise the app\u2019s performance and gain further insights into how transmission occurs.\nIt is expected that the final phase of evaluation, which will include getting sign-off from ethics committees and also ironing out any technical glitches, will be completed within weeks. However, it is possible the app would be rolled out later in the year before current restrictions are lifted.\nIn China, authorities have reportedly used mass surveillance of smartphone data to classify people\u2019s health status according to a traffic light system and restrict movements accordingly. The system is being used to control who is allowed to return to work and other activities as the city of Wuhan began to relax its lockdown in the past week.\nIt is understood that the NHS app would be an opt-in system and that it would not be required to access NHS testing services, or to get permission to return to work, for instance. Instead, people would be encouraged to sign up as part of a collective effort to bring the pandemic under control.\nProf Michael Parker, director of the Wellcome Centre for Ethics and Humanities at the University of Oxford and co-author of the paper, said that it ought to be possible to roll out the contact-tracing app without breaching data protection laws. \u201cIn emergency situations, there are all sorts of things that are allowable that wouldn\u2019t be otherwise and that seems appropriate,\u201d he said. \u201cThe most important thing is there\u2019s public trust and confidence and clarity of what\u2019s happening.\u201d\nThere would need to be oversight of the app\u2019s deployment, clear \u201cstop rules\u201d about what happens to data after the pandemic is brought under control and careful attention paid to ensure those without smartphones would not be disadvantaged.\nDavid Leslie, an ethicist at the Alan Turing Institute who studies the governance of data-driven technologies, said that public trust in data collection, sharing and use have been eroded by the monetisation of personal data by big tech companies and the intrusive use of data by some governments. Despite this, the circumstances of the pandemic could allow people to set aside these reservations.\n\u201cI believe that if we put the proper protocols of responsible innovation in place \u2013 protocols which ensure that these technologies are democratically governed, based on individual and community consent, proportional, and constrained with sunset provisions \u2013 a higher level of intrusiveness would be more widely acceptable,\u201d he said.\nAn NHSX spokesperson said: \u201cNHSX is looking at whether app-based solutions might be helpful in tracking and managing coronavirus, and we have assembled expertise from inside and outside the organisation to do this as rapidly as possible.\u201d\nA UK start-up company is preparing to launch a free app that will help people observe physical distancing more effectively by informing them when locations are busy. The Keep Your Distance app, developed by Lanterne, will provide real-time live data on the businesses and essential places that people need to visit, such as supermarkets and pharmacies. The app uses GPS satellite data and data available from Google and crowdsourced information to help people decide whether or not it is a good time to visit. If a location is particularly crowded, users are presented with less crowded alternatives nearby.",

        "content": "World\u2019s largest cruise operator and owner of Diamond Princess admits sector may never recover from pandemic\nCarnival, the world\u2019s largest cruise operator, is looking to raise $6bn (\u00a34.8bn) in new funding as it admitted that demand may never recover after the coronavirus pandemic.\nThe cruise giant, whose lines include the UK\u2019s P&O Cruises and Cunard, and the Princess brand whose ships were the first to be quarantined offshore due to coronavirus, will raise $3bn in bonds secured on its ships, a further $1.75bn in convertible bonds and $1.25bn through issuing new shares.\nThe impact on cruises could potentially outweigh almost all other sectors of the deeply damaged travel and tourism industry, which has been brought to a virtual global halt by Covid-19. The spectacle of passengers on the Diamond Princess, confined to cabin while the ship was docked off Japan, became a global story in February as the virus spread.\nCruise passengers tend to be heavily represented by the over-70s, the demographic most vulnerable to Covid-19, and ships are known to swiftly spread outbreaks of all viruses, such as the comparatively benign vomiting bug norovirus.\nAlthough it has paused all cruise holidays, several of Carnival\u2019s ships remain at sea and unable to disembark passengers, including some sailings with coronavirus fatalities still on board.\nCarnival\u2019s subsidiary Princess Cruise Lines is still involved in a standoff in Australia, where the Ruby Princess is anchored near Sydney with more than 1,000 crew on board. The ship is now believed to have been a major cause of bringing coronavirus to Australia, with one in 10 recorded cases having been cruise passengers.\nWhile Carnival has recorded around $3bn in annual profits from just under $20bn in revenues last year, it expects to post losses this year and its future is now uncertain.\nIn a downbeat statement to the stock market announcing its refinancing plans, Carnival listed the ways in which the spread of Covid-19 was affecting its business. It said the \u201cresulting illness and loss of life\u2026 could have a long-term impact on the appeal of our brands, which would diminish demand for vacations on our vessels.\u201d\nFuture cruises, when restarted, would likely be subject to \u201cheightened governmental regulations and travel bans and restrictions\u201d which would limit customers and ports of call.\nThe cruise operator said it had incurred significant additional costs in repatriating passengers, assisting stranded crew and sanitising ships. It is also being sued by passengers aboard the Grand Princess, who were detained off California for five days earlier this month with coronavirus cases on board.\nCarnival added: \u201cWe have never previously experienced a complete cessation of our cruising operations, and as a consequence, our ability to be predictive regarding the impact of such a cessation on our brands and future prospects is uncertain.\u201d\nThe crisis has also shed light on the industry\u2019s employment and accounting practices. US president Donald Trump said a bailout of Carnival would be difficult because the corporation is registered in Panama, rather than in America.\nCarnival\u2019s London-listed shares rebounded after falling in early trading and closed up 8% at 981p.",

        "content": "Jerry Falwell Jr, the evangelical institution\u2019s president, faced criticism for downplaying coronavirus risks when inviting students to return to campus\nWith cases of Covid-19 rising rapidly across the US, last week was a strange time for Jerry Falwell Jr to decide to reopen Liberty University.\nOriginally, in keeping with other universities in Virginia, Falwell, the institution\u2019s president. said that only international students or those with nowhere else to go would remain. But on Sunday he welcomed over a thousand students back to campus housing.\nFalwell Jr had previously compared Covid-19 to the flu, posited that there has been an \u201coverreaction\u201d to the pandemic intended to hurt Donald Trump, and insinuated that the virus was a \u201cChristmas present\u201d from North Korea and China.\nFalwell Jr told Fox News last Tuesday that students wanted to be there \u2013 indeed, some have spoken up in favor of his decision. But others are watching events unfold with a heavy heart.\n\u201cI\u2019m a pro-life advocate for all ages,\u201d said Jess Schama, a 24-year-old history major at Liberty University.\nReferencing Falwell\u2019s comments in a Twitter thread, in which he said that young people are unlikely to die from contracting Covid-19, Schama said: \u201cI don\u2019t think that people, even at my age, should be subjected to a virus that could potentially kill. It is so hypocritical that people who would advocate pro-life are OK with this.\u201d\nI don\u2019t want to become one of these college presidents who are pushing this problem off on someone else by sending 20 year olds with near zero mortality risk to sit at home for the rest of the semester, often with grandparents in the house who truly are at risk. (2/4)\nSchama has an underlying health condition and said she would have feared for her life every day if she remained on campus. Furthermore, while the mortality rate for those under 50 is much lower than for the elderly, a CDC report last week confirmed that with regard to US hospitalizations, of those admitted to intensive care, 36% were aged 45-64 years and 12% were aged 20-44 years.\nLauren Lynch, 27, said she was upset by Falwell\u2019s assertion that the population in Lynchburg is less vulnerable than elsewhere. As part of her studies, she works as a mental health clinician in Lynchburg. \u201cA lot of [people here] are at risk. [Many] live in poverty \u2013 especially in downtown Lynchburg. A lot of people don\u2019t know that, when they come here, all they see is the Liberty campus,\u201d she said.\nFurthermore, while states such as New York have thousands of intensive care units, Lynchburg hospitals have 1,174 beds in total \u2013 only 55 of which are for intensive care. For that reason, Schama thinks the decision to allow students to return after periods at home during spring break is particularly irresponsible.\n\u201cYou\u2019re putting those people at risk: those who don\u2019t have healthcare, some who are already sick, while these students [come back] from all over the country \u2013 from highly populated areas like New York, New Jersey, everywhere,\u201d she said.\nThere is no obligation for students to return to campus, and Falwell has claimed that the school is \u201ccompletely online\u201d \u2013 despite medical, aviation and other practical classes still happening in person. He has described Liberty as being \u201cmore like an apartment complex\u201d than a university, with the canteen only open for takeout; but the library is open, as are computer labs. Falwell said that signs remind students not to sit next to each other, and that only every third computer works to prevent students from doing so. Liberty University was contacted for comment, but did not respond in time for publication.\nLiberty University\u2019s code of conduct, known as the \u201cLiberty Way\u201d, includes not listening to lewd music, engaging in sexual relationships, disobeying faculty members or putting others at risk.\nLynch believes that Falwell has been hypocritical and does not practice what the college preaches \u2013 for example, the Liberty Way advises against name-calling, and yet, when one parent with concerns contacted Falwell on Twitter (\u201cI\u2019m as right wing as they get, bud. But as a parent of three of your students, I think this is crazy,\u201d said the parent), Falwell responded by calling him a dummy.\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe he has conducted himself in a very professional manner \u2026 He is bringing a horrible name to Christianity,\u201d said Schama.\nSchama said Falwell\u2019s decision compromises students who want to do the right thing without being insubordinate. She says students have been advised when speaking to the media to remember that Liberty students \u201care champions for Christ, we are all Christ\u2019s children, and we need to promote ourselves in a godly way\u201d. Schama empathizes with those principles, and believes students should respect authority. However, as a Christian, she feels she has a duty to speak out.\n\u201cAt this point it doesn\u2019t come down to how I think I should be conducting myself on social media. It comes down to what I think is right, and giving a voice to those who can\u2019t speak up because of the potential backlash,\u201d she says. And for her, there is a clear line when it comes to her Christian values: \u201cAbsolutely \u2013 it is ungodly to allow people to keep spreading an infection that could potentially kill people,\u201d she says.\nOn Sunday, the New York Times reported that one Liberty University student had tested positive for Covid-19 of three off campus studends that were referred to local hospital centers for testing, while an additional eight were told to self-isolate.\nSchama believes the New York Times is propagating fake news, and said she had instead been going to the faculty website for updates. Still, she keeps on looking \u2013 mainly out of fear for her teachers. \u201cI\u2019m terrified for my lecturers. I really don\u2019t feel like anyone\u2019s safety has been taken into consideration,\u201d she says.\nWhat will she do, then, if she finds out later that the numbers are correct?\n\u201cA lot of people, including myself will be very upset that the university did not speak up sooner. Timing is everything. It would mean it was just putting more people at risk,\u201d she says.\nThis article was updated on 17 April 2020 to clarify that the students who were tested lived off-campus.",

It is unacceptable for the government to simply point to a general fund which has been allocated to all those in need. Instead, it must secure specific funding for survivors to ensure they are able to access specialist services and safe and suitable accommodation.\n\u201cThe reality is that local authorities are unable \u2013 and in many cases unwilling \u2013 to support and protect women effectively unless the government provides adequate resources, guidance and training. Unless and until this happens, survivors will continue to suffer.\u201d\nThe letter demands a separate emergency fund for local authorities to ensure they are able to adequately house survivors of domestic abuse in appropriate locations.\nSpeaking to the Guardian, Nicole Jacobs, who was appointed domestic abuse commissioner in September, said early indicators showed an increase in demand for services run by charities for victims of domestic abuse.\nThe national domestic abuse helpline, run by the charity Refuge, reported a 65% increase in calls to the helpline on Saturday compared with the same day the previous week, and traffic to its website and use of web chat facilities have increased. Smaller helplines focused on family courts and male victims of violence have also reported increased calls.\nJacobs said smaller charities will come under significant pressure during the crisis and called for government assistance to keep the vital services afloat.\nShe said: \u201cThere is a postcode lottery of the provision of these services. This is layering more stress on a rocky foundation.\n\u201cThese are great services but they are going to struggle financially if there is no overarching strategy from government targeted to domestic abuse and sexual violence services that are going to struggle to make ends meet, and will be dipping into reserves to get through the period.\u201d\nKaren Ingala Smith, the founder of a pioneering project that records the killing of women by men in the UK, said she had noted an increase in deaths in the past two weeks.\nIngala Smith, chief executive of domestic abuse charity Nia and founder of the Counting Dead Women project, said initial analysis of her data suggested there had been \u201ca higher rate of killings in the last few weeks\u201d.\nHer figures showed at least eight women have been killed by men in the past two weeks, with a further four suspected cases. This is compared with 99 women who were killed by partners in the year to March 2019, which equates to nearly two a week.\n\u201cWomen are isolated, trapped with abusive men, so they\u2019re exposed. Women have less access to support, not just community support, but services like ours; women will not be able to have face to face meetings,\u201d she said.\nOfficial UK government advice for victims of domestic abuse during the public health crisis says it is in regular contact with the charity sector and the police to ensure that support services remain open during the outbreak.\nAn MHCLG spokesperson said: \u201cDomestic abuse is an abhorrent crime and its victims must always be fully supported. We will do everything we can to help domestic abuse support services keep vital provision fully functioning during the Covid-19 emergency.\u201d\n\u201cWe are working closely with charities, organisations and councils involved in providing these services and the domestic abuse commissioner to ensure those fleeing abuse have a safe place to go to.\u201d\nThe Scottish government announced extra funding of \u00a31.35m to Scottish Women\u2019s Aid, to ensure the maintenance of key support services and alternative access via online video platforms and text messaging, as ministers insisted that the message to stay at home should not deter women from seeking urgent help.\nAt her daily briefing on Tuesday, the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said: \u201cThere is a real risk that women and children already subject to domestic abuse will feel even more isolated and vulnerable during this crisis, so this funding will ensure they have access to support services.\u201d\nPolice Scotland said that it would be actively working to identify those most at risk but that it was too early to assess the impact of coronavirus on incidents of domestic abuse across the country.",

He\u2019d be better than Biden, this guy Cuomo. But I\u2019d beat him, too.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cLet me ask you something. With all of this adulation that you\u2019re getting for doing your job, are you thinking about running for president? Tell the audience.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Governor Cuomo. \u201cNo.\u201d\nThen the two Italian American brothers indulged their developing habit of bickering endearingly on prime time TV:\nChris Cuomo: No, you won\u2019t answer?\nAndrew Cuomo: No. I answered. The answer is no.\nChris Cuomo: No, you\u2019re not thinking about it?\nAndrew Cuomo: I answered the question, sometimes it\u2019s one word. I said no.\nChris Cuomo: Have you thought about it?\nAndrew Cuomo: No.\nChris Cuomo: Are you open to thinking about it?\nAndrew Cuomo: No.\nChris Cuomo: Might you think about it at some point?\nAndrew Cuomo: No. No.\nChris Cuomo: No, you won\u2019t answer?\nAndrew Cuomo: No, I answered. The answer is no. No is sometimes one word. I said no.\nChris Cuomo: Have you thought about it?\nAndrew Cuomo: No.\nChris Cuomo: Are you open to thinking about it?\nAndrew Cuomo: No.\nChris Cuomo: Might you think about it at some point?\nAndrew Cuomo: No.\nChris Cuomo: How can you know what you might think about at some point right now?\nAndrew Cuomo: Because I know what I might think about and what I won\u2019t think about. I won\u2019t think about it. But you\u2019re a great interviewer by the way.\nChris Cuomo: Appreciate it. Learned from the best.\nThe governor also offered praise for Biden, who he said was \u201ca great public servant\u201d and \u201ca guy who does the job for real Americans\u201d.\nThe brothers discussed Trump\u2019s apparent insinuation that New York hospitals and emergency staff are stealing protective equipment, although the governor refused to be drawn into criticising the president, insisting he did not know what Trump had meant by the comment.\nAndrew Cuomo also delivered a sobering message for New Yorkers stuck, like his brother, at home, unsure of how long the crisis will last.\n\u201cThe apex is anywhere from six days to 21 days away, depending on who you listen to,\u201d he said.\nAccording to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, New York has around 67,000 of 164,000 Covid-19 cases confirmed in the US, and around 1,300 of 3,161 deaths. Federal public health experts have said the US could see between 100,000 and 200,000 deaths.\n\u201cThe apex can either be one and a half times the capacity of the hospital system, or three times the capacity of the hospital system,\u201d Cuomo said, \u201cdepending on which projection you reach. I want to prepare for that apex because this virus has been ahead of us every step of the way.\u201d\nOn Sunday, Cuomo told viewers of his daily press conference to \u201cseek joy\u201d in their forcibly proscribed lives, possibly through family ritual. At the close of the interview, the younger Cuomo tried to one-up his brother by describing how their mother only taught him how to make her special pasta sauce.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve always been good at manipulation,\u201d the older Cuomo shot back. \u201cYou\u2019ve always been the meatball of the family.\n\u201cLook, some of us have to work, right? I don\u2019t have the luxury of working one hour a day, right? I\u2019m happy for you, God bless you. But most of us work more than one hour a day, that\u2019s all I\u2019m saying.\n\u201cI have to do my job and momma didn\u2019t raise an armchair general in me, anyway. I\u2019m not going to sit in my basement \u2026 I love you, be safe, call me sometime.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll send you some sauce,\u201d Chris Cuomo said.\n\u201cLove you, brother.\u201d said Andrew. \u201cMeatball.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a term of endearment in Italian circles,\u201d Chris Cuomo said, adding to his unseen producers: \u201cPlease hang up on him now. He has a lot of work to do.\u201d\nOn Tuesday, CNN announced that Chris Cuomo had tested positive for coronavirus. He said he would continue to broadcast daily, from isolation in his basement.\nIn Albany, Andrew Cuomo told reporters his brother was \u201cyoung, in good shape, strong, not as strong as he thinks, but he will be fine\u201d.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a really sweet, beautiful guy,\u201d the governor said. \u201cAnd he\u2019s my best friend.\u201d",

        "content": "Government\u2019s critics not among 90,000 inmates eligible for early release due to coronavirus\nAnger is growing in Turkey that while the government is preparing to grant amnesties to up to one third of the country\u2019s prison population in order to combat the coronavirus pandemic, jailed human rights activists, journalists and opposition politicians will not be among those considered for early release.\nThe Turkish parliament discussed a legal amendment on Tuesday which should make 90,000 of the country\u2019s approximately 300,000 prisoners eligible for either house arrest or parole by halving sentences for offences including non pre-mediatated murder and organised crime. Early drafts of the bill, which would also have covered sex offenders and those convicted of gender-based violence, were dropped after being met with outrage from women\u2019s rights groups.\nOf perhaps the greatest concern is not who the new law lets out of prison, but who it keeps in. While rights groups have welcomed some of the new measures to keep inmates safe from coronavirus, such as alternative incarceration or home arrest for those over 65, those with pre-existing conditions and female prisoners with young children, political prisoners have been very clearly overlooked.\nOn Monday Amnesty International along with two dozen human rights organisations joined Turkish groups calling for the immediate release of journalists and other political prisoners such as opposition leader Selahattin Demirta\u015f and philanthropist Osman Kavala, who are currently detained under notorious anti-terrorism legislation and are therefore not eligible under the new terms.\nDespite enacting a near total shutdown to fight Covid-19, Turkey\u2019s number of confirmed cases has skyrocketed from 1,872 a week ago to 13,531 on Tuesday.\nWhile justice minister Abdulhamit G\u00fcl has so far insisted that the pandemic has not reached Turkey\u2019s overcrowded prison system, \u00d6mer Faruk Gergerlio\u011flu, a pro-Kurdish People\u2019s Democratic party (HDP) politician and former doctor, checked with hospitals to confirm that at least one patient who tested positive had been transferred for treatment from Ankara\u2019s Sincan prison. Ankara\u2019s public prosecutor accused Gergerlio\u011flu of \u201cprovoking anxiety, fear, and panic among the public\u201d and said an investigation had been launched.\n\u201cWe have been campaigning to improve the standards in prisons for a long time,\u201d Gergerlio\u011flu told the Guardian.\n\u201cThere are already many violations in terms of healthcare access, staffing levels, contagious disease, people dying from lack of treatment for their illnesses. I have submitted many questions to parliament about these cases \u2026 our justice system is broken.\u201d\nIn recent years, Turkey has arrested thousands of academics, lawyers, journalists, civil servants and members of the military it says were part of the outlawed Gulenist movement, which it blames for a failed coup in 2016, as well as Kurdish activists and politicians the state claims have links to the banned Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK). Many languish in lengthy pre-trial detention. There are so many prisoners, in fact, that in order to take pressure off a system already at 121% capacity, Ankara is planning to build 100 new prisons.\nIdris Say\u0131lgan, a Kurdish journalist, was convicted on terrorism charges after a trial in which the only evidence presented against him were his articles. He spent more than three years in jail before being released in November last year.\nThe overcrowded cells and filthy conditions he experienced in first Mus and then Trabzon prison could lead to coronavirus killing many in the Turkish system, the 29-year-old said.\n\u201cAt Mus prison I shared a cell seven steps long with 14 other people. Some cells had even more people than that. There was only one bathroom for all of us,\u201d he said.\nIn Trabzon, cells were still overcrowded: Say\u0131lgan\u2019s cell was only meant for four people but housed eight, so two people had to sleep on the floor. Low quality food and unsanitary conditions led him to develop gum disease. Prisoners had to buy their own cleaning products.\n\u201cWe had to pay for everything ourselves: toilet paper, soap, shampoo, bleach for cleaning. We only got two showers a week,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is impossible to do social distancing or practise good hygiene in such conditions. If coronavirus spreads in prisons, it will be a massacre.\u201d\nConditions may be about to get worse: recent news articles suggested that prisoners in Turkey are now having to pay 17 lira (\u00a32.09) for their own face masks, and advocacy group Jurists for Freedom said in a report that inmates have complained that not all prison staff are wearing protective masks and gloves. As part of social distancing measures visits from family members have been stopped and lawyers are now only allowed to visit clients with a prosecutor\u2019s permission.\nCoronavirus also appears to be exacerbating the Turkish freedom of speech crisis which led to so many getting locked up in the first place. Reporters without Borders said that seven journalists have been arrested for their reporting on the pandemic and charged with \u201cspreading panic\u201d, and 385 people are being investigated for critical social media posts.\nDuring the crisis, the government has also found time to arrest another five HDP mayors in Turkey\u2019s southeast, who are likely to be replaced with unelected pro-government trustees.\n\u201cThis attitude explicitly displays the government\u2019s intentions: common criminals will be released but the political prisoners will remain behind bars,\u201d said Veysel Ok, co-director of the Media and Law Studies Association, a non-profit legal defence organisation.\n\u201cThis [decision not to free political prisoners] at this time, in a way, is equivalent to a verdict of death penalty.\u201d",

But the government said this depended on the private company providing 5,000 tests.\nQuestioned about the issue at the Welsh government\u2019s press conference on Tuesday Gething said the administration had a written undertaking with the private company.\nHe said: \u201cWe had a clear agreement for that company\u2019s team to come into Wales and to set up the infrastructure required. The company made a decision they weren\u2019t able to fulfil the agreement they\u2019d reached with us.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been clear about my disappointment that hasn\u2019t happened. I recognise the interests of the public and in particular our frontline workers to increase our capacity sooner rather than later. There\u2019s no getting away from the fact that those additional tests that we were due to have would have made an earlier difference to us.\u201d So far Wales has tested about 1,000 health and social care staff.\nAt the press conference, Gething was asked if the company involved was Roche. He refused to name the company and said his focus now was to provide more tests through other providers: \u201cWe\u2019ve diversified the range of people we\u2019re working with. You will see an increase.\u201d\nGething added that \u201cwithin two to three weeks\u201d Wales would be able to carry out about 5,000 tests a day. By the end of May there would be capacity for a further 4,000 tests on top of this.\nA spokesperson for Roche Diagnostics said it had no contract or agreement directly with the Welsh government.\nThe spokesperson said: \u201cRoche does not have, and has never had, a contract or agreement directly with Wales to supply testing for Covid-19. Roche has an agreement only with the UK government to increase testing capacity across the whole of the UK. The UK-wide roll-out is being coordinated centrally by Public Health England, including Wales.\u201d\nThe Plaid Cymru leader, Adam Price, criticised the Welsh government\u2019s handling of the situation.\nHe said: \u201cHaving blamed a company for failing to deliver on a vital agreement to provide an extra 5,000 Covid-19 tests, it beggars belief that the Welsh government is refusing to say why the deal collapsed.\u201d\nAmong the questions it has asked in the Welsh assembly is: \u201cCan the minister confirm whether or not the Welsh government has information to suggest its written agreement with a supplier to provide Covid-19 testing collapsed because of preferential terms offered by Public Health England or any other body acting on behalf of the UK government?\u201d\nPrice added: \u201cIt is in the public interest for the Welsh government to be honest with the public and to provide urgent answers about what happened \u2013 and why. Precious time has been lost and countless lives may now be at greater risk.\n\u201cTesting is one of the best weapons we have to defeat this pandemic by tracking and tracking the spread of the virus, and ensuring frontline health and care workers are protected and can go back to work. The Welsh government shouldn\u2019t be \u2018disappointed\u2019, they should be furious.\u201d\nPublic Health England strongly dismissed the suggestion that it had interfered with any contract involving the Welsh government.\nA spokesperson said: \u201cThe UK government recently asked Public Health England to establish a partnership with Roche to support increased diagnostic testing in the UK.\n\u201cTesting in Wales using the Roche capabilities is due to begin next week \u2026 Public Health England did not intervene in any discussions between Roche and Wales.\u201d",

A five-member council of state would be selected, with two members chosen by the opposition, two by Maduro\u2019s Socialist party, and the fifth member picked by the other four. The military high command would remain in place.\n\u201cThe hope is that this set-up promotes the selection of people who are very broadly respected and known as people who can work with the other side,\u201d the US special representative for Venezuela, Elliott Abrams, told the Associated Press.\nThe US and EU would then lift sanctions on the current leadership. Broader sanctions on the country\u2019s oil business would be lifted after all foreign forces had left the country. All sanctions would be lifted after free elections, to be held within six to 12 months.\nThe proposal comes five days after the US indicted Maduro and top members of his government and army for drug trafficking and money laundering, and as Venezuela faces blanket sanctions, a collapse in the price of oil, its main export, and the coronavirus pandemic, with a crippled health system.\n\u201cThe United States has long been committed to finding a solution to the manmade crisis in Venezuela,\u201d the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said. \u201cThe urgency for this has become all the more serious in light of the Maduro regime\u2019s failure to adequately prepare for and address the global Covid-19 pandemic. This framework demonstrates our commitment to helping Venezuela fully recover and ensures that the voice of the Venezuelan people is respected and included.\u201d\nSceptics of the plan said it provided few incentives for the incumbent officials to give up power, days after they were charged with serious offences and multimillion-dollar rewards put on their heads.\nEliot Engel, the Democratic chair of the House foreign affairs committee, said: \u201cEssentially, Maduro regime officials are being told on one hand that nothing they do will stop the US [Department of Justice] from pressing charges against them while on the other hand, they are being asked to agree to a transition government for unrelated sanctions relief.\u201d\n\u201cThe people of Venezuela cannot afford such a ham-handed approach. It\u2019s time to get serious about our Venezuela policy,\u201d Engel said.\nDavid Smilde, a senior fellow at the Washington Office on Latin America, said the deal was very similar to what was discussed by Maduro and Guaid\u00f3 representatives in Oslo and Barbados last summer, with one major difference.\n\u201cComing less than a week after indicting all the main figures of the Maduro government it would seem the Trump administration is trying to hardwire in who they think should be part of a transition,\u201d Smilde said on Twitter. \u201cThis was a main point of contention during last summer\u2019s negotiations, with the US reluctant to endorse any transition plan that allowed Maduro to preside over new elections.\u201d\nBriefing journalists on the new plan, a senior administration official said the US was prepared to negotiate with Maduro about the terms of his departure from office.\nBut the official referred to the fate of Gen Manuel Noriega, the Panamanian dictator, who was indicted on drug smuggling charges in 1988 and then removed in a US invasion the next year.\n\u201cHistory shows that those who do not cooperate with US law enforcement agencies do not fare well, \u201c the official said. \u201cMaduro probably regrets not taking the offer six months ago. We urge Maduro not to regret not taking it now.\u201d",

Taking exercise outside our homes involves walking or running on pavements (Coronavirus outdoor etiquette: no spitting, and keep your distance, 23 March). Very few pavements are 2 metres wide; most are much less. As soon as somebody comes towards you, it is impossible to stay 2 metres apart. But pavements usually come in pairs. Why don\u2019t we make them, where possible, one way?\nSince we drive on the left, why don\u2019t we walk or run on the right, so that we face the traffic, but no longer have to face at close quarters those walking in the opposite direction? This idea can be refined. People wishing to overtake those in front of them should make their presence known and, as they approach, maximise the distance between them and those moving more slowly. The latter should have right of way, as on the sea.\nThe current situation we have is nonsensical: you are allowed to go outside for exercise even if this immediately compromises your efforts to keep your distance from others.Dr Mike GillFormer regional director of public health, London\n As I take my permitted exercise around our suburban estate, I am taken back 85 years to when the world was blessedly quiet, we could play football in the road without danger or much interruption and children didn\u2019t have to be accompanied by parents.\nThat\u2019s as it is now, but things will revert after the emergency and our little holiday will be over.Ted ClarkLeamington Spa\n Picking up my prescription at a Tesco pharmacy last week, I noticed that it was only dispensing and had the shelves covered.

Pike had turned his back on a sport that ravaged his confidence and took him to the bleakest of places before summoning extraordinary strength to clear his head and give it another chance.\nPike was the wonderkid who, at one point in the 1990s, barely seemed to be off the television. The story of how things fell apart is desperately sad and presents essential reading for anyone involved with a young footballer. Four years ago he decided to tell it, resurfacing to give several interviews, including one to the Guardian. The turnaround those conversations wrought was, he believes, profound.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to make it sound like a miracle but talking helped me so much,\u201d he says. \u201cI find myself speaking about my issues almost daily now and I don\u2019t struggle, it\u2019s just all out there. I feel free to go, \u2018I\u2019m having a nightmare today, I\u2019m not happy about this or that\u2019, where before I\u2019d just bottle it up.\n\u201cAfter talking about all of it I felt happy and ready to get involved in football again. I found myself doing the same things I\u2019d been doing as a kid \u2013 looking at boots in magazines, checking out balls like the old Adidas Questras and the Mitre Cosmics. All these old sensations were coming back and I thought: \u2018You know what, why am I so worried about investing my feelings in this?\u2019 For years I\u2019d been nervous. I hadn\u2019t wanted to get hurt again because I had a lot of problems. But I thought: \u2018I\u2019m going to go for it again.\u2019\u201d\nPike formed a clear idea of what he could offer. For one thing, he had trodden a path he would not wish on anyone and there was no shortage of advice he could impart. He visited a number of clubs and gave talks at universities and other institutions, expanding on the problems that sent his life off course. There were offers to perform ball-juggling tricks for TV adverts but that did not feel right and was, given all that had passed, a little close to the bone. Two decades after being the next big thing, there was a better way to channel his gift.\n\u201cPlaying football, that was my forte: the skills, the touch,\u201d he says. \u201cI started watching videos on YouTube of coaches doing certain things, took some badges and other qualifications, and just started doing sessions in my local park via word of mouth or people I knew from before. I said to Rosie: \u2018This is a good idea, I feel it suits me and I\u2019m naturally gravitating towards it.\u2019 And then we came up with this idea.\u201d\nHis one-on-one academy classes are aimed largely, but not exclusively, at youngsters who aspire towards a professional career. Some of his students are training with top-flight or Football League clubs but have enlisted Pike to fine-tune some of the technical movements \u2013 quick feet, tight spaces, close control \u2013 that made him such an enthralling prospect. Exercises from the time he spent, famously, as a trialist at Ajax go down well and when we meet he has been perfecting what he calls the \u201cAjax handclap\u201d \u2013 dribbling in and out of cones while clapping above your head \u2013 with Finley, a 14-year-old on trial at Southampton.\nOthers might be lacking confidence in different areas. Pike wants to develop an operation that helps create footballers but assists them in developing the resilience to survive all eventualities. \u201cAway from the pitch, that\u2019s where I find I can really help,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve had kids here who stop midway through a session and explain they\u2019ve been scared to make a tackle, or something\u2019s happened at school. We\u2019ll have a conversation and it means the world to me when I get a message later saying \u2018thanks\u2019 or \u2018you\u2019ve brought him right out of himself\u2019. It\u2019s as if I\u2019m coming back to do the things I needed done for me 20 years ago, trying to be the person I wish I\u2019d had by my side when I was 14.\u201d\nPike is gentle, softly spoken, easy company. It is not difficult to see how he can be that mentor figure, although he thinks young players today have more sophisticated support networks than were available to him. \u201cMy story was very much a one-off, I think. At that time, I was the only person to live that; no one had gone as far as I did with all the big companies and all that attention. That\u2019s got a lot to do with what went on.\n\u201cGenerally I think the academies are much better than they used to be; many of the ones I\u2019ve visited have impressed me. But there still needs to be more. I think there should be a mandatory standard for in terms of aftercare and the mental health side.\u201d\nMost of the attention, when Pike underwent his catharsis in 2016, was on the devastation wreaked by those grasping for spoils before his playing prospects unravelled. His father, Mickey, came into particular focus and there has been no reconciliation. \u201cNo ill feeling or anything, it was 20 years ago and loads has happened, but we haven\u2019t met or spoken,\u201d he says. Some of the revelations back then were shocking; his autobiography is due in September and he thinks the traumas it will lay bare are greater.\n\u201cWhen I stopped playing football, some of the mistakes I made and things I did were just ridiculous. There were positions I found myself in during my early 20s that I shouldn\u2019t have ever been in. Loads of problems; I struggled for a while with everything. It was just through anger at not being a footballer, things not going your way, and it gets you acting in a way you really shouldn\u2019t at all.\n\u201cThere are a lot of lessons from those times I\u2019d like to convey to the kids here just so that, whether they become a footballer or not, they can hit the ground running in life and live normally.\u201d\nLife is treating him well on all fronts, at long last. Family time with Rosie, Freya and five-year-old Beau is the priority but he takes visible delight in being in love with football again and there are big hopes for his coaching school. Pike remembers studying The Knowledge in \u201ca tiny little shed\u201d but hopes that, one day, he may be able to leave the cab and concentrate on the new development.\nIt is a heartwarming story: a happy ending in one sense; a vivid new beginning in another. It took so much pain, hurt and darkness to get here but he wonders whether he has finally found his place.\n\u201cI\u2019ve actually started thinking that to myself quite a lot recently,\u201d he says. \u201cI was meant to be this star footballer and all of a sudden I\u2019m here doing this for young players. All over the country there are people setting things up to coach kids and help them back into football and I\u2019m now one of them. Maybe it was meant to be this way; perhaps this is what I was supposed to do all along.\u201d",

Plus, Susan Whitham sets readers straight on the Buxton \u2018beauty spot\u2019 that is anything but\nThere seems to be an attitude, not just among the police but also among the public, that because these are tough times, we should all pay some sort of penance (UK police warned against \u2018overreach\u2019 in use of virus lockdown powers, 30 March). I\u2019ve even heard of police shouting \u201cThis is not a holiday\u201d to people. Well excuse me for not wanting to self-flagellate! Even if this was in response to people grouping together, such a comment is appalling, as it implies that the police are simply opposed to people enjoying themselves, when they should just be professionally upholding the laws limiting viral spread. Frankly, we don\u2019t need attitude from the police when times are already tough.\nIf people are not social distancing or if they are otherwise doing something that might increase viral spread (based on formal scientific advice, not just a police officer\u2019s personal opinion) then, yes, enforce the law and fine or use force where necessary. I have encountered such behaviour when walking near my flat on Plymouth Hoe and I find it every bit as abhorrent and as selfish as everyone else does. Otherwise, people should be allowed to go about their lives. We are not under house arrest, this is a free country, and everyone should only be concerned with observing or enforcing well-defined, science-based legal measures that will limit viral spread.\nIf the police lose public respect (and they are currently going about it the right away), we\u2019re really stuffed.John TurnerPlymouth\n Lord Sumption is absolutely correct to criticise Derbyshire police for apparently believing that they had to enforce government guidance, as opposed to the law. The job of the police, as ever, is to apply the law and not government opinion or diktats. The reason is simple: the view of any government may change from day to day and from minister to minister, whereas the law is fixed unless and until changed. I fear that a heavy-handed and totally unwarranted approach by the police may be the thin end of the wedge. We live in difficult times, but that is no reason for us to be careless or carefree about preserving our hard-won democratic and civil liberties, whatever the police may think.Dr Stephen Pacey(Retired judge), North Muskham, Nottinghamshire\n Lord Sumption\u2019s familiarity with history is, alas, far inferior to his knowledge of law (Covid-19: ex-supreme court judge lambasts \u2018disgraceful\u2019 policing, 30 March). Contrary to his claims, totalitarian regimes \u2013 whether Nazi or communist \u2013 did not arise because citizens voluntarily surrendered their liberty in exchange for state protection, as any understanding of the revolutions of 1917 or 1933 will demonstrate, but because of the treacherous power grabs of the would-be dictators and their cronies. There is simply no analogy between the actions of our police and the Gestapo or the NKVD. It is not the government that is being hysterical, it is Lord Sumption. Jeremy AdlerKing\u2019s College London\n There has been the most lively criticism of the dyeing of the Buxton \u201cblue lagoon\u201d. This pool has been described by Lord Sumption as a \u201cbeauty spot\u201d. I can only think he has never been there. And he shouldn\u2019t.\nI live over the hill from Buxton. I can tell you categorically that this evil pool is not a beauty spot. It is a body of water with a pH similar to ammonia or bleach. It is the result of limestone quarrying. The startlingly blue water is speciously attractive. It is a desolate place, difficult to reach, and there are notices everywhere warning you not to enter the water. Rubbish litters the area \u2013 anything less like a beauty spot is hard to imagine. It has been dyed black before to deter visitors tempted to take a dip in its poisonous waters.\nThose who like to condemn this action, which was solely to protect the idle public who go up there out of sight to gather in groups, may be heartened to know that such is the powerful chemical composition of this pool and its surroundings that soon it will regain its alluring but malevolent Bahama blue colour. We can only repress nature so much before it resumes its status quo.Susan WhithamMacclesfield",

We have been highlighted because of the slightly unusual use of drones.\n\u201cBut there are some forces who have implemented more draconian measures. Some have implemented roadblocks. We are not doing that and we do not intend to do that.\u201d\nBy Monday, the Lancashire force had issued 123 fines under the emergency powers, which came in last Thursday and outlawed non-essential shops staying open, two or more people gathering and tried to get people to stay in their homes with limited exceptions.\nForces such as Bedfordshire, Durham, Hampshire, Leicestershire, Lincolnshire, Northamptonshire, Suffolk, West Midlands, Wiltshire as well as Derbyshire are yet to use the enforcement powers.\nDerbyshire\u2019s police and crime commissioner, Hardyal Dhindsa, told the Guardian he defended the force\u2019s actions to bolster physical distancing. \u201cDerbyshire police have been applauded and the majority of the public have been very cooperative, understanding and supportive,\u201d he said.\nSome other forces are using nudge theory to encourage people to comply, pointing out how many already are rather than highlighting problems.\nIn a video message, teh Greater Manchester police chief constable, Ian Hopkins, thanked the public for a \u201chuge\u201d drop in numbers on the streets.\nHe also accepted mistakes had been made implementing the radical and sweeping emergency laws: \u201cOur policy is engage, encourage, explain and lastly enforcement. There will be individual officers who will get that wrong and we are working very hard for consistency.\n\u201cPolicing by consent is important and we can only make all of this work with the consent of the public. I want to thank the vast majority of you that are sensibly following the guidance.\u201dPolice chiefs want to achieve greater consistency across forces with an expectation the lockdown will last considerably beyond the three weeks initially announced by the prime minister last Monday.\nThere are concerns about public tolerance as the lockdown continues and the weather warms up.\nGracie Mae Bradley, the policy and campaigns manager at the human rights organisation Liberty, said the different interpretations by different forces meant people did not know how to observe the laws.\n\u201cDespite the broad scope of these powers, we\u2019ve seen various incidents of police going even further \u2013 and beyond their lawful remit. This makes it impossible for people to know how to comply with these new rules, and challenge police when they overreach. There has also been a counter-productive lack of clarity in government statements on these rules.\n\u201cThere have been amazing community responses to this pandemic, and people have shown they are willing to change the way they live \u2013 but that goodwill, and the broader aim of protecting public health, will be undermined by harsh and heavy handed policing.\u201d\nAdam Wagner, a human rights barrister at Doughty Street Chambers in London and a visiting law professor at Goldsmiths University, tweeted: \u201cMy sense is that there is major confusion over the difference between the government guidance and the law set out in the Coronavirus Regulations 2020. Police can advise the public but must make clear (and be clear themselves) what they have power to enforce.\u201d",

This is going to be a long-term battle.\u201d\nChina and South Korea have both delayed key national college entrance exams over growing fears of a second wave of coronavirus cases, underlining the difficulties countries face in returning to normal life even after successfully reining in infections.\nChina\u2019s crunch two-day annual \u201cgaokao\u201d test, taken by more than 10 million students last year, will be pushed back to 7 and 8 July, authorities said, as 48 new infections were reported on Tuesday, all of them imported, reversing four days of declines.\nSouth Korea, which after an early surge \u201cflattened the curve\u201d of new cases to an average of about 100 a day also postponed its annual college entrance exam and cancelled the planned reopening of schools, as groups of cases in churches, hospitals and nursing homes, as well as imported cases, continue to flare.\nAccording to the Johns Hopkins University tracker, the virus has infected more than 800,000 people worldwide and killed more than 40,000. About 3.6 billion people, more than 40% of humanity, are living in voluntary or mandatory confinement.\nItaly, which on Tuesday said its death toll had climbed by 837 to 12,428, the highest in the world, mourned its dead with a minute\u2019s silence and flags flown at half mast, as southern Europe began to see the first glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel.\nCovid-19 is \u201can injury that has hurt the whole country,\u201d the mayor of Rome, Virginia Raggi, said on Tuesday after a priest read a prayer for the dead. \u201cTogether, we will get through this,\u201d she said at a ceremony held outside Rome\u2019s city hall.\nThe government extended its economically crippling and socially divisive lockdown until at least mid-April, but the rate of infection has declined dramatically, rising by about 4% a day so far this week against more than 60% a month ago.\nHowever, the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, said the country must not give up the gains it had made. The near three-week shutdown had been tough, Conte said, and \u201ccannot last very long. But it will have to be lifted gradually.\u201d\nSpain, which has suffered the world\u2019s second most deadly outbreak after Italy, hit another new record with 849 coronavirus deaths in 24 hours on Tuesday, while the number of confirmed cases rose by nearly 11% to 94,417.\nThe figure marked a slight increase on the previous day\u2019s rate, but its equivalent last week was more than 20% every day. \u201cThe downward trend is continuing,\u201d said Maria Jose Sierra of the emergency coordination unit.\nAustralia, which has not entered full lockdown but imposed tough social distancing rules earlier in the pandemic\u2019s spread than both Italy and the US, on Tuesday also reported a sustained fall in the country\u2019s rate of new infections.\nAuthorities reported a death toll of 19 for 4,400 cases nationally, with the daily rate of infections slowing to an average of 9% over the past three days from 25-30% a week earlier. But healthcare experts warned it was far too early to ease up. \u201cWe need to have weeks on end of decreasing numbers of new cases on a daily basis,\u201d said Philip Russo, president of the Australasian College for Infection Prevention and Control.\nIreland, too, said the daily growth rate in confirmed cases had halved. Restrictions on social and commercial life have had \u201can enormous impact\u201d, said Philip Nolan, chair of the Irish Epidemiological Modelling Group. He also warned against complacency, saying the rate would have to fall to \u201cclose to zero\u201d for it to be suppressed.\nIn other developments:\nFacebook and Twitter deleted posts from Brazil\u2019s president Jair Bolsonaro and Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro for spreading coronavirus misinformation.\nFrance announced 499 new deaths, the biggest increase since the start of the pandemic, bringing its total to 3,523 with 52,128 confirmed cases.\nIran reported 141 new deaths and 3,111 new cases of coronavirus, taking its totals to 2,898 and 44,606 respectively.\nShortages of protective health gear in India, facing an expected surge in cases, are forcing some doctors to use raincoats and motorbike helmets.\nRussia recorded an increase of 500 cases, the biggest daily rise for the seventh day in a row, taking its total to 2,337 with 18 deaths. It also introduced severe punishments - including up to seven years in prison - for people breaking quarantine rules or spreading fake news about the coronavirus.\nIndonesia confirmed 114 new coronavirus infections, bringing its total to 1,528, with 14 deaths.\nA 12-year-old girl confirmed infected with Covid-19 has died in Belgium.\nGermany reported a rise of 128 in its death toll to 583, with 61,913 confirmed cases, an increase of 4,615.\nA study from Imperial College London suggested containment measures may already have saved up to 59,000 lives in 11 European countries.\nIn the US, authorities in Virginia, Maryland and Washington DC became the latest to ask citizens to stay at home, leaving about three-quarters of Americans in some form of lockdown.\nDonald Trump sought to reassure Americans urgently needed equipment such as ventilators and personal protective gear was on its way, but warned that \u201cchallenging times are ahead for the next 30 days\u201d.\nUrsula von der Leyen, the European commission president, urged member states to respect the bloc\u2019s core values amid fears restrictions imposed by some could erode democracy.

        "content": "In the past fortnight an optimism of sorts has returned but the rebound rests in part on some pretty heroic assumptions\nAt the end of the first quarter of the year, stock market investors are counting their losses. The FTSE 100 index has fallen 25% since the turn of the year, its worst single quarter since 1987. The financial crisis of 2008, around the collapse of Lehman Brothers, ran for several quarters and should still be considered more severe. But, whatever your yardstick, 2020 so far has been brutal for equity investors, which includes most people with a pension plan.\nNarrow your focus to the last couple of weeks, however, and the picture looks different. You could almost believe normal life has returned. The FTSE 100 overall has risen in seven of the last nine trading days, and in eight of the last 12. And, if you caught the bottom, congratulations: you could have made about 16% in three days.\nGrounds for optimism? It\u2019s far too soon to say, obviously. All one can conclude from the outbreak of relative calm is that investors like the policymakers\u2019 responses so far. A fortnight ago, their big fear was a credit crisis \u2013 and the first stirrings were definitely present. Central banks (at least for now) seemed to have seen off that risk by flooding the financial system with liquidity and \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d messages. That was the moment when peak panic passed. Even the rush to the haven of US dollars has abated.\nMeanwhile, western government\u2019s economic lockdown measures \u2013 everything from the $2tn (\u00a31.6tn) stimulus package in the US to UK chancellor Rishi Sunak\u2019s \u00a3330bn lending package plus 80% \u201cfurlough\u201d scheme in the UK \u2013 have been applauded as robust interventions that maximise the chances of a V-shaped recovery. Investors have even learned to love lockdowns: they speak to the same narrative that, once the spread of the virus has been contained, the global economy will rev with pent-up demand by the end of the year.\nThe script could indeed develop that way but some heroic assumptions are being made. The rapid bounce-back theory rests on the idea that lockdowns will last only two or three months, at most, with no need to reimpose them.\nPerhaps that will be accurate but, remember, the investment consensus eight weeks ago was that Covid-19 was mainly a China-only affair and would be over quickly. Projections have been made to look very silly very quickly in this crisis. It is why little should be read into Tuesday\u2019s better-than-expected survey of business confidence in China: one unreliable piece of data does not imply a lasting rebound.\nNor do we know if governments\u2019 support packages, though they seemed enormous on announcement, will be sufficient. Look at the calls for extra help already piling up at the UK Treasury\u2019s door: even commercial landlords, who should be well placed to take some strain, are begging the state to cover shortfalls in their rental income.\nWhat we know now is that there will be a big bill at the end. The UK Debt Management Office on Tuesday said it would raise \u00a345bn just in April via sales of government debt, a stunning sum that compares with \u00a39.5bn in the same month last year. In the coming financial year, the UK\u2019s budget deficit could treble to \u00a3200bn, or 10% of GDP, the Institute of Fiscal Studies estimated last week. Meanwhile, companies, many of which were carrying too much debt in the first place, will be carrying even heavier levels. It all drags on investment.\nStock markets can, obviously, look through such worries \u2013 they are in the business of peering round the next corner. All the same, it\u2019s hard to believe this bear market will be banished quickly. Stuttering progress, punctuated by frequent disappointments, feels as much as one can reasonably expect from shares for a while. In the phrase we\u2019re hearing a lot from clinicians these days, it\u2019s a marathon not a sprint.",

However, the FTSE is still almost 2,000 points below where it started the year, when the index was near the highest levels on record.\nOn the final day of a month of unprecedented chaos on global financial markets, the FTSE 100 closed up almost 2% at 5,672. The index started the year at 7,542. Shares across Europe have suffered the worst month on record, while Wall Street has been through the fastest bear-market plunge in history. The Dow Jones industrial average has fallen by more than 20% from its previous peak \u2013 the definition of a bear market \u2013 in little more than 20 days, outstripping the speed of the slide during the 1929 Wall Street crash.\nAs well as the steep losses in London, the Italian stock market has plunged by 27% marking its worst quarter on record, and the pan-European Stoxx 600 has fallen by 23% in the worst quarter since 2002. Shares in European travel and leisure companies have collapsed by almost 42% to mark the worst three-month period in history. The price of oil has also plunged by more than 65% to around $22 a barrel, as demand for crude slumps with the global economy heading for recession.\nAirlines, travel firms and banks are among the biggest losers on the London stock market over the past quarter, as consumer demand evaporates in response to efforts to contain the Covid-19 outbreak. Shares in cruise operator Carnival, which has had some of its ships put into quarantine, have plunged by more than 75% in three months, while International Consolidated Airlines, the owner of British Airways, has fallen by around 67%.\nThe milestones for the stock market coincide with mounting hopes of a turnaround in economic fortunes as China \u2013 the first country to be hit by Covid-19 towards the end of last year \u2013 begins to lift travel restrictions in the central city of Wuhan after two months of effective lockdown.\nProviding a potentially encouraging glimpse of the future for countries still suffering an increase in the number of Covid-19 cases, Chinese companies reported a rebound in economic activity this month as firms gradually reopen. The manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index published by China\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics increased to 52.0 this month, up from a record-low level of 35.7 in February on a scale where a reading above 50.0 separates economic growth from contraction.\nService sector activity also recovered as shopping centres and retail outlets reopen, with the PMI index increasing to 52.3 from 29.6 in February.\nMihir Kapadia, chief executive of Sun Global Investments, said China had demonstrated that economic growth could bounce back strongly from the coronavirus crisis.\n\u201cWe still have long months of battle as the US has just started dealing with it. Global economic growth and trade will continue to be affected until the disease is contained across the world. But as China shows, there is hope at the end of the tunnel,\u201d he said.\nAnalysts believe the global economy is heading for the deepest downturn since the second world war. While the recovery could be swift, there are rising fears of a long-term hit to jobs and growth.\nVicky Redwood, a senior economic adviser at the consultancy Capital Economics, warned that consumer and business confidence could remain subdued as the return to relative normality takes time to take hold, not least if fears of a second wave of the virus linger. She said some companies would struggle to repay emergency loans, austerity policies could be used to control rising government debt levels, and demand for foreign travel might remain subdued for years.\n\u201cIt may well take a few years to get back to where we were and even longer for some economies,\u201d she said.",

The prime minister claimed he would continue to shake hands with people he met, said the UK could send coronavirus \u201cpacking in 12 weeks\u201d and proclaimed that he would see his mother on Mothering Sunday despite social distancing rules.\nProblems with the strategy were addressed on Thursday by Cummings and his director of communications, Lee Cain. They held a virtual meeting with Levido at No 10 at which they invited him to take a major role in the government\u2019s strategy.\nThere have already been some cosmetic changes. On Monday Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, unveiled new bright yellow branding on the Downing Street podium, which drew comparisons with the arresting colour scheme used by NCP car parks and the posters for Reading and Leeds music festivals.\nAt the same time, there has been a willingness to slap down ministers who step away from the agreed line, much as in a general election campaign. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, was contradicted by Downing Street on Monday after he advised people to shop for food only once a week.\nA raft of former advisers have been brought back to Whitehall to track public opinion and gauge whether the government\u2019s key messages on handwashing and self-isolation are getting through, including Gabriel Milland, a former head of news at the Department for Education under Michael Gove who is known for his experience running focus groups to refine messaging.\nBen Guerin, a 25-year-old online campaigner from New Zealand, is also expected to reprise his role as a strategist from December\u2019s successful election.\nA source said Levido was part of an effort to move the operation into a \u201ccampaigning mode\u201d, starting from last week, after a recognition that communication had not always been effective.\nA Whitehall insider said that Johnson and Cummings, both of whom are self-isolating with coronavirus symptoms, have sought recruits who proved to be reliable operators in their victories at the general election and 2016 EU referendum.\n\u201cIt is a campaign to win over the public to the government\u2019s message. They have a proven track record,\u201d the source said.\nCummings\u2019 recent absence from Downing Street has cleared the way for the continued rise of Levido \u2013 a protege of Sir Lynton Crosby, and described by one friend as \u201cthe new Lynton\u201d. A long-time campaign obsessive, Levido now finds himself at the heart of the British government, shaping how Johnson\u2019s handling of the crisis is perceived by the public.\nDescribed as an intense, obsessive individual who is loyal to his team, he is known for pulling all-nighters and pushing rigid message discipline. He says he remains in close contact with Crosby, 63, according to individuals who worked on the Conservative election campaign. When the scale of the Tory victory at the election was revealed, others in the office began singing \u201cOh Isaac Levido\u201d to the tune of The White Stripes\u2019 Seven Nation Army in recognition of his role.\nHailing from the New South Wales town of Port Macquarie, he previously worked on the 2015 and 2017 general election campaign, plus Zac Goldsmith\u2019s 2016 bid to be mayor of London. He has also done messaging for the likes of mining giant Glencore, according to sources, plus political campaigns from the Caribbean to Asia.\n\u201cHe hates the fiscal spending craziness,\u201d said one individual who knows Levido. \u201cHe\u2019s a proper conservative like Lynton.\u201d\nGuerin is one half of the Auckland-based social media campaigns business Topham Guerin, which has previously been exposed by the Guardian for its role helping to run Facebook astroturfing campaigns on behalf of major polluters. The pair are also former colleagues of Crosby and worked closely with Levido to re-elect Scott Morrison in Australia\u2019s general election.\nDuring the British general election campaign, Topham Guerin were in charge when the Conservatives deceptively rebranded their official press office account as FactCheck UK \u2013 while also taking particular delight in winding up those who reported on their online adverts creating \u201cboomer memes\u201d by issuing knowingly terrible parodies of their own work through official Conservative accounts. Their online activity is known for its blunt messages and shareability.",

London North West Healthcare NHS trust reported 38 new deaths, taking its total to 93, the highest of any UK trust. A total of 55 deaths have been reported at Barts Health NHS trust, the next highest.\nA total of 367 deaths were reported by NHS England as of 5pm on 30 March. The new figures include a 19-year-old who had no underlying health conditions, the youngest death to have been reported in England to date. The NHS had previously suggested an 18-year-old had died from the virus but later said the person tested positive but died from an unrelated condition. Overall 28 of those who died had no underlying health conditions.\nHowever the figures are not an accurate picture of the deaths over one day, as some deaths announced in today\u2019s release occurred earlier this month. Of the 367 deaths, at least seven occurred more than a week ago.\nProf David Spiegelhalter, at Cambridge University\u2019s statistical laboratory, said: \u201cThe extreme day-to-day variation in reported Covid-19 deaths is far more than we would expect from chance variability and must be due to reporting practices. Some deaths occurred many days ago, and there seems to be fewer reported over the weekend. So great caution is required in interpreting daily figures.\n\u201cOver the last week, reported deaths rose on average by an estimated 21% each day, similar to Italy at the same stage of the epidemic, around two weeks ago. Italy\u2019s death rate appears to have now levelled off at around 900 a day, and we can hope that our death rate will also flatten off due to the measures started a few weeks ago.\u201d\nThe Midlands has now reported 329 deaths and accounts for a fifth of the overall death toll. The region with the fewest deaths is the south-west, where 91 people have died of the virus. The trusts with the highest numbers of deaths outside London are Royal Wolverhampton NHS trust (53), University Hospitals Birmingham NHS trust (43) and Portsmouth Hospitals NHS trust (39).\nScotland reported 13 more deaths to take its overall total to 60, while Wales reported seven more deaths, bringing the number of deaths to 69. Northern Ireland reported six new deaths taking its total to 28.\nDevolved administrations use different reporting periods from England. As such the official UK total from the Department of Health and Social Care may not reflect the most recent national figures.\nMethodology\nAll data on NHS trusts has been gathered from NHS England press releases. In early releases, deaths were matched to news reports where no clear date was supplied. All deaths are dated to when the public is notified by NHS England; however, this may not be the actual date the death took place because of a delay between the occurrence and clearance for the NHS to report it publicly.",

The retailer is understood to be in discussions with its landlords about the next bill, due in June.\nLast week, the value fashion chain Primark refused to pay \u00a333m in rent after the closure of its UK stores due to the coronavirus outbreak. The Swedish fashion retailer H&M is also pushing for waivers on its rent and service charge bill.\nThe sportswear giant\u2019s stores in the UK, mainland Europe and the US all shut last week. In an update to investors, it warned the shutdown would have a \u201csignificant impact\u201d on its financial outlook.\nJD Sports has been one of the industry\u2019s biggest success stories of recent years. It was promoted to the FTSE 100 in 2019 as it rode the success of the \u201cathleisure\u201d boom which has turned trainers and hoodies into big business. The decision to withhold rent, first reported by industry magazine Retail Week, will come as a blow to the country\u2019s shopping centre owners who are already suffering a collapse in their rent take.\nMany retailers were struggling before the coronavirus epidemic due to the combination of weak consumer confidence, a shift to online shopping and rising costs. However, the closure of all non-essential stores as part of the response to coronavirus has left many chains facing a fight for survival, with Debenhams, New Look and Topshop owner Arcadia among the retailers seeking rent holidays.\nLast week Intu Properties, the property group behind the Trafford Centre in Manchester and Lakeside in Essex, said it had received just 29% of rents due this month. Rival group Hammerson received 37% of UK rent billed for the second quarter and said it had been deluged with requests for rent deferrals, cuts or waivers after the majority of retailers were forced to close their shops.",

Some have spent in excess of \u00a310,000 but instead of a refund they are only being offered an unwanted change of dates.\nAbta\u2019s chief executive, Mark Tanzer, has called on the government to allow firms four months to process payments.\n\u201cThe global pandemic has put enormous financial strain on tour operators and travel agents on a scale that is unmanageable in the short term. These businesses are themselves waiting for refunds from hotels and airlines and, without this money, they simply do not have the cash to provide refunds to customers. We want to avoid the scenario of normally successful travel businesses employing tens of thousands of people facing bankruptcy.\n\u201cWe are proposing some simple, temporary changes to regulations to buy more time for companies to keep trading, while ensuring customer rights are protected. Many European countries, including France, Belgium, Denmark and Italy, have already announced similar regulatory changes to preserve their travel industries and protect customers,\u201d he said.\nHe also called on the government to take strong enforcement action against the airlines that have flouted the law by withholding refunds following the cancellation of flights.\nA widespread failure among travel firms would leave affected passengers having to apply to the Atol compensation scheme, which is still recovering from Thomas Cook\u2019s collapse.\nThe National Audit Office warned earlier this month that the government would have to pick up the bill for any future collapses.

        "content": "Despite grim milestone, senior UK medical leaders spoke of \u2018green shoots\u2019 of recovery\nOne of the UK\u2019s most senior medical leaders lauded \u201cgreen shoots\u201d of recovery from the coronavirus crisis, even as the daily death toll hit a record 381 and experts questioned whether the government has a credible route out of the lockdown.\nSpeaking in No 10, Stephen Powis, the medical director of NHS England, said there had been a \u201cbit of a plateau\u201d in the number of people testing positive for coronavirus, which could be a sign that the UK is seeing a slowdown in its spread.\nHe gave his assessment at a press conference alongside Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, who said it was \u201cdeeply shocking, disturbing, moving\u201d that 381 people had died in a day. The latest figures take the total UK death toll from coronavirus to 1,789.\nAmong the deaths was Ismail Mohamed Abdulwahab, a 13-year-old boy from London, the UK\u2019s youngest victim of coronavirus. He reportedly had no underlying health conditions.\n\u201cSadly, a 13-year old boy who tested positive for Covid-19 has passed away, and our thoughts and condolences are with the family at this time,\u201d King\u2019s College hospital said in a statement.\nEarlier in the day, NHS England confirmed that a 19-year-old had died after testing positive for Covid-19. The Italian chef, named as Luca di Nicola by La Repubblica, was at that stage believed to be England\u2019s youngest victim. His aunt told the website that he was \u201cvery healthy\u201d.\nNew figures showed an additional 40 previously unreported coronavirus deaths in England and Wales earlier this month. The new figures, published by the Office for National Statistics for the period to 20 March, suggest that almost one in five coronavirus deaths are occurring outside hospitals, so went uncounted in data published by NHS England.\nDespite the highest day for deaths since the crisis began, Powis said there was some cause for hope that social distancing is working, because of the relatively flat numbers of people testing positive for coronavirus.He cautioned that there were \u201cgreen shoots \u2013 but only green shoots and we must not be complacent and we must not take our foot off the pedal.\u201d\nIt came amid increased pressure over the failure to carry out mass testing, which some public health experts believe is the only sensible way to ease lockdown conditions. Daily testing stood at just over 8,200 on Tuesday, short of the 10,000-a-day target.\nPublic health academics told the Guardian that widespread testing in the community \u2013 not just in hospitals and among NHS workers \u2013 was necessaryto suppress new hotspots.Gove said there were shortages of chemical reagents used for testing live cases of the virus.\nHowever, the Chemical Industries Association told ITV it was not aware\n of any shortages and was contacting Gove\u2019s office to find out what he\n meant.\nThe group said reagents are being produced and delivered to the NHS.\n\u201cWhile there is of course an escalating demand, there are reagents being manufactured and delivered to the NHS,\u201d it said in a statement.\n\u201cEvery business here in the UK and globally is looking at what they can do to help meet the demand as a matter of urgency. To clarify the exact NHS need and meet it, all relevant UK industries are continuing to work closely with government.\u201d\nThe difficulty of obtaining tests was underlined by the Welsh government\u2019s admission that a private company had pulled out of a contract to provide 5,000 tests daily, leaving Wales only able to carry out 800 tests a day.\nOne Whitehall insider concerned about the government\u2019s strategy told the Guardian that there were two barriers to more testing \u2013 firstly that the UK had been too slow to order tests, and secondly that government experts are still privately \u201ccounting on herd immunity\u201d as a way out of the crisis, despite ministers\u2019 denials.\nThe source said the fact that the government keeps talking about the possibility of an antibody test to show whether someone is immune shows ministers are still thinking about herd immunity.\nMatt Hancock, the health secretary, insisted on March 15 that herd immunity was \u201cnot a part\u201d of government strategy. But as recently as March 24, Jo Churchill, a health minister, said in a written answer to parliament that it was still part of the government\u2019s expectations. \u201cHerd immunity is not part of the government action plan but is a natural by-product of an epidemic,\u201d she said.\nDr Jenny Harries, the deputy chief medical officer, appeared to confirm that the UK is still hoping for a large degree of immunity among the public to help lead to an easing lockdown measures. The alternative would be a strategy of suppressing the virus where it arises through rigorous testing and quarantining, as seen in South Korea.\n\u201cThe have-you-had-it test is the secret to the secret to the answer about the lockdown,\u201d she told the government press conference. \u201cIf we know how many people have had it, then we will understand the proportion of the population that could still get it. That gives us the clue to a number of things. For example, if we are to develop a vaccine, we can know how many people we need to immunise. If we are going to take lockdown measures off, we can model to say we know this proportion of the population is still likely to get the disease, so what happens to the second spike if we take them off\u2026\n\u201cThere are other scientists testing cohorts\u2026 so we can start to get an idea how many people in the population have had it. That is more of a clue to managing the end of the outbreak and when we can take the locks off.\u201d\nSeveral public health academics challenged the government\u2019s strategy. Prof Nicola Stonehouse, an expert in molecular virology at the University of Leeds, said: \u201cWe should test for virus and exposure in the public. If we have that information we can have a more sensible approach about moving back to normality.\n\u201cIf we can\u2019t get the perfect reagent or set of reagents do we do nothing, or say let\u2019s use something else? That\u2019s where things have jammed up. Other countries are working around that. We have to be more creative.\u201d\nDevi Sridhar, professor of global public health at University of Edinburgh, also said: \u201cEveryone in quarantine [is] not sustainable. It\u2019s really expensive economically and socially. There has to be a safe way out of lockdown and I can\u2019t see any other way than mass testing. We have to figure out who has the virus, who they are around, and change it so only they are in quarantine. Lockdown is a very blunt tool, it\u2019s not precise. If they can\u2019t do the testing they should just come out and say it.\u201d\nShe said both tests of live cases and an antibody test \u2013 to show who has had the virus - were needed.\nAmid the concerns about testing, there appeared to be better news on ventilators, as Gove revealed that the first newly-commissioned devices will roll off the production line this weekend and be delivered to the NHS next week.\nGove also confirmed that three RAF Puma helicopters are now stationed at Kinloss Barracks in Moray - working with a Chinook and Wildcat helicopter based at RAF Leeming in North Yorkshire - to meet requests for assistance from NHS boards and trusts across Scotland and Northern England.\nThey have been made available to evacuate critically ill patients as well as moving equipment and medical personnel around the country.\n This article was amended on 1 April 2020 to correct a reference to \u201cone in four\u201d coronavirus deaths potentially occurring outside of a hospital setting; this should have been one in five. It was also amended to make clear that the additional 40 recorded deaths were for the period to 20 March.",

By having a DNACPR form in place you protect your family \u2026 [and] emergency responders from this additional risk.\u201d\nThe letter said that in an \u201cideal situation\u201d doctors would have had this conversation in person with vulnerable patients but had written to them instead due to fears they are carrying the virus and were asymptomatic. \u201cWe will not abandon you,\u201d it said. \u201cBut we need to be frank and realistic.\u201d\nThe GP surgery directed the Guardian to the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board, which said the recommendation that vulnerable patients complete DNACPR forms was not a health board requirement.\n\u201cA letter was recently sent out from Llynfi surgery to a small number of patients,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cThis was not a health board communication.\n\u201cThe surgery have been made aware that the letter has caused upset to some of the patients who received it. This was not their intent and they apologise for any distress caused. Staff at the surgery are speaking to those patients who received the letter to apologise directly and answer any concerns they may have.\u201d\nThe letter went viral on social media and one person said a nurse practitioner had recently visited her father, who is receiving palliative care, to also request he sign a DNACPR form.\nThe number of deaths from the virus in the UK rose by 393 on Tuesday \u2013 the highest rise since the pandemic began \u2013 taking the overall toll to 1,789.\nThe NHS currently has 8,175 ventilators and has said it needs 30,000 more to deal with an expected peak of Covid-19 patients, while the health service is reportedly attempting to increase its intensive care capacity sevenfold amid fears the full effect of the pandemic could be overwhelming.\nThere is a lack of personal protective equipment across the NHS despite renewed efforts to provide ambulance crews, GP surgeries and hospitals with the masks, visors, gloves and aprons that help prevent coronavirus transmission. At least three healthcare workers have already died from the virus.\nDoctors in the UK must consult with patients or their families if they decide that resuscitation would not be effective or that complications would result in more pain. Families can seek a second opinion but the decision is ultimately a medical judgment to be made by a doctor.",

        "content": "Michael Gove tries \u2013 and fails \u2013 to hit us with \u2018the Facts\u2019 at the daily No 10 coronavirus press conference\nThat sound you just heard?\nThe barrel being scraped. When the main purpose of the Downing Street press conference is to convey the truly horrific death tolls from the coronavirus and to put the best gloss on the government\u2019s \u2013 at best \u2013 belated response, the least you might hope for is a cabinet minister of some gravitas and sincerity.\nBut with Boris Johnson and Matt Hancock both sidelined with the virus and Rishi Sunak \u2013 just about the only person who inspires confidence despite being only 12 \u2013 unwilling to make it a daily gig, the government is having to scrabble around for whoever they can get. And with some ministers \u2013 such as Priti Patel, Liz Truss, Grant Shapps and Jacob Rees-Mogg \u2013 being obvious non-starters both on the intellect and empathy counts, the gene pool of talent is remarkably thin. And after Dominic Raab\u2019s less than convincing, finger-licking performance the day before, he\u2019s unlikely to get a call back any time soon.\nSo this time we got Michael Gove as front of house. A man who has almost become a dictionary definition of someone who cannot be trusted. A politician who was twice rejected as leader by the Tory MPs who knew him best on the grounds he could not be relied on not to stab himself in the back.\nOn the plus side, he had remembered to replace the pyjama bottoms that he had worn for the Zoom cabinet meeting in the morning with his suit trousers \u2013 though everyone in the entire cabinet now has it in for Liz T after she upstaged them all by posing in front of a Union Jack. On the downside, he began by insisting on mentioning \u201cthe Facts\u201d.\nThe Facts and the Govester are uneasy bedfellows.\nAnd after listing the recent mortality rates, Mikey swiftly went off piste. Rather than getting to grips with any details of the levels of testing, he went headlong into obfuscation and wish fulfilment.\nYes, we were doing a few more tests than the day before \u2013 about 17 \u2013 and we needed to do a lot more. The problem was getting the necessary reagents to make them.\nThe Govester rather skirted over the reason we were short of reagents was that his government was totally asleep on the job back in January and February \u2013 the scandal of the Big Ben bongs and the necessity of the 10-day half-term break for Boris were far more important \u2013 at a time when the chemicals were more widely available.\nNow every country that makes them is predictably keen to hang on to them for themselves. But the Govester did have better news on ventilators as we would now be buying some from EU countries. He said that through gritted teeth.\nStephen Powis, the national medical director of the NHS, looked equally uneasy when called on to make his presentation. Though mainly because he had clearly been designated to find a few graphs that showed the crisis in a more positive light, when he clearly believes the shit has yet to really hit the fan.\nSo he started off with a slide showing that fewer people were using public transport. That was his best lead off shot.\nHe then moved on to another slide which apparently showed the UK mortality rate stabilising. Even though the curve appeared alarmingly steep. Powis also \u2013 clearly under instructions \u2013 chose to ignore why the German and South Korean death figures were so much lower. Eventually, though, his integrity won through.\n\u201cThese are just green shoots,\u201d he repeated several times. And winter could return at any time to snuff them out. The partial lockdown was essential and here to stay for a while.\nAnd the alt-right libertarian half-wits who were demanding the right to do what they wanted would just have to suck it up. It wasn\u2019t that Powis objected to them killing themselves. It was them taking out the rest of us at the same time with which he had problems.\nInevitably most of the questions focused on the UK\u2019s inadequate testing systems \u2013 both for NHS workers and the general public \u2013 and the capacity for hospitals to cope with more patients. Here Gove showed himself to be something of a new man.\nNormally, Mikey reckons that experts have nothing more of value to say than anything that happens to pop into his head. But under a sustained grilling from journalists, he now chose to answer as few questions as possible.\n\u201cI think that\u2019s one for either Stephen or Jenny,\u201d he said. Trying to make it look like courtesy rather than cowardice.\nBoth Powis and the deputy chief medical officer, Jenny Harries, did their best to level with the country. Things were critical but so far the NHS was building capacity and was coping under the strain. Harries did sound a little optimistic about the possibility of home, postal tests \u2013 in my neck of the woods we haven\u2019t had a mail delivery for more than a week \u2013 but that was her only slight mis-step.\nWe were where we were and she and Powis would be back tomorrow or the next day to provide further updates. Just who the government would find to front \u2013 leadership is asking way too much these days \u2013 the roadshow was anyone\u2019s guess.",

Some doctors have been given a ticking-off after managers were irritated by material they had posted on social media.\n\u201cDoctors across the frontlines are extremely concerned about the lack of personal protective equipment [PPE]. Many have told us they have tried to raise concerns through the proper channels but have been warned against taking these concerns further,\u201d said Dr Samantha Batt Rawden, DAUK\u2019s president.\n\u201cAt this time when we desperately need every single doctor on the frontline, some have had their careers threatened, and at least two doctors have been sent home from work. This is unacceptable. Doctors have a moral duty to make their concerns regarding Covid-19 public if these cannot be resolved locally,\u201d she added.\nThe NHS organisations involved appear to want to stop staff from highlighting the lack of facemasks, goggles, visors and gowns that has created huge alarm and fear at the frontline. Many health professionals are worried that they may contract the virus during the course of their work, especially if their PPE is inadequate, and pass it on to patients or their families.\nIn recent weeks staff have posted photographs on social media platforms such as Twitter and Instagram of makeshift PPE they have put together using materials such as bin bags.\nFor example, A&E staff at Southend hospital in Essex have been warned that they could face disciplinary action if they raise the issue of PPE publicly.\nIn a memo on 26 March they were told: \u201cThe posting of inappropriate social media commentary or the posting of photographs of staff in uniform who are not complying with IPC [infection prevention and control] standards and social distancing requirements is unacceptable. Such behaviour will be considered under the disciplinary policy.\n\u201cNow, perhaps more than ever, NHS staff are in the public eye and we have a responsibility to convey a professional image and to role model positive messages about social distancing. It would be very sad for moments of inappropriate or unprofessional behaviour to undermine the respect that we and our colleagues have from the public.\u201d\nMinisters and NHS bosses have organised thousands of deliveries of millions of pieces of PPE to hospitals, GP surgeries and other healthcare settings in England over the last 10 days, often with army drivers bringing it. However, many staff still report ongoing shortages.\nIn other testimonies given to DAUK:\nAn intensive care doctor who voiced unease about facemasks was told by their hospital that \u201cif we hear of these concerns going outside these four walls your career and your position here will be untenable\u201d.\nAnother intensive care specialist was called into a meeting with their bosses and disciplined after raising concerns.\nA GP working at Chase Farm hospital in London was sent home for voicing unease.\nA consultant paediatrician in Yorkshire was told in an email from their hospital that their social media output was being monitored and they should be careful.\nA GP who appealed to her community on social media for more supplies of PPE was then barred by her local NHS clinical commissioning group from speaking out. \u201cI was being warned I wasn\u2019t toeing the party line,\u201d she said.\nHelen O Connor, an organiser with the GMB union, said: \u201cJust as it seemed that the widespread and dangerous culture of gagging clauses and suppressing the voices of NHS workers might be coming to an end it is now intensifying.\n\u201cIt is scandalous that hospital staff speaking out publicly face being sacked by ruthless NHS bosses who do not want failings in their leadership to be exposed. Suppression of information is not just a matter of democracy, it is now a major public health issue.\u201d\nNHS England pointed out that staff were continuing to speak to the media about Covid-19.\nAn NHS spokesperson said: \u201cOnce a major incidents occurs it is vital that the public receive fast, authoritative, open, clear and consistent information from their NHS, which is why, in line with longstanding emergency preparedness, resilience and response protocols, official communications are therefore always coordinated nationally.\n\u201cBut staff continue to speak in a personal, trade union or professional body capacity, and it is self-evident from print and broadcast media coverage throughout this incident that staff are able and do in fact speak freely.\u201d\nThe British Medical Association, the main doctors\u2019 trade union, on Tuesday called on Robert Jenrick, the communities secretary, to clarify what NHS staff who felt they did not have the right PPE for dealing with Covid-19 patients should do, given his comment that \u201cwe cannot and should not ask healthcare workers to be on the frontline without appropriate protective equipment\u201d.",

        "content": "The world No 1 has been undergoing a resurgence since missing the cut at his home Open and feels adversity has helped his game \nRory McIlroy turned responses to personal adversity into an art form long ago. His Masters capitulation of 2011 was followed up by winning the US Open. A courtroom appearance against his former management and the high-profile cancellation of a wedding preceded the hitting of professional heights.\nMcIlroy was at it again last autumn. Five weeks after missing the cut at the Open - and not any Open - he took delivery of the FedEx Cup and its $10m bounty.\nHe has enough perspective to realise the coronavirus crisis means golf is insignificant now and has joined a social media campaign to that end but, in a purely sporting sense, he must rue this hiatus. We will never know how far McIlroy\u2019s rebound from the gloom of Royal Portrush last July would have taken him in the context of April 2020 and the Masters. Evidence suggested this was his finest chance to complete the grand slam of major titles.\nHis consistency was rewarded with a return to the top of the world rankings in February. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever felt this comfortable with all facets of my game,\u201d McIlroy said before sport shuddered to a halt.\nWe speak a number of weeks before the coronavirus takes hold. McIlroy adopts self-deprecation on being reminded of his sentiments 12 months ago; the Open\u2019s visit to Northern Ireland for the first time since 1951 was dominating his thoughts. \u201cHow did that work out?\u201d asks the 30-year-old with a smile.\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been able to turn very difficult things into positives. I\u2019ve been able to respond well and even excel. That comes from reflection, from thinking deep and hard about things. I\u2019ve always had a knack for \u2018what happened, what went wrong?\u2019 then making sure I\u2019m better the next time. You might not be 100% better, it could be five to 10%. Continuous building.\n\u201cAs dejected as I was after Portrush \u2026 It was a gradual build until I got back to the top spot in the world. That might not have happened if Portrush hadn\u2019t turned out as it did. I had to take a long, hard look at myself. I needed to press the reset button and that might not have happened had I finished 12th or 10th. It was a huge catalyst for me to change a few things. I\u2019ve been disciplined and worked hard.\u201d\nThe grisly details from Ireland\u2019s north coast will live long in the memory of anyone who witnessed them. McIlroy watched his first shot fly out of bounds. Backed by vociferous support, he came so close to surviving for the weekend but an opening round of 79 proved fatal.\nHe was close to tears during Friday interviews, with the complex relationship between a global star and his homeland laid bare. Christmas spent back in Holywood was \u201ca little bit different\u201d as a consequence.\n\u201cI have always felt like I\u2019ve been relatable and approachable,\u201d he says. \u201cI think there was a thing back home where people didn\u2019t feel that way about me any more. Because of what I went through at Portrush, maybe to show that vulnerability, people could relate to me a little more again. It\u2019s a weird one.\n\u201cWhen someone becomes who I have \u2026 I play all over the world and am a very recognisable sportsperson. I come from such a small place, I don\u2019t know if people think you get above your station and forget where you are from? I said it at the time, I forgot how much the place and the people mean to me.\u201d\nMcIlroy was encouraged to loosen the shackles that naturally tighten as a career plays out so publicly. \u201cI\u2019ve nothing to lose,\u201d he says. \u201cFalling flat on your face in front of your home people, at a tournament you\u2019ve been thinking about for 10 years, that\u2019s the worst that can happen. So what have I got to lose after already experiencing that? Nothing else can top that in terms of disappointment, so let\u2019s go for it.\u201d\nIn normal circumstances McIlroy would now be in the midst of Masters mayhem but he regularly emphasises the psychological distance he puts between himself and tilts at history. Spend all winter thinking of Augusta? No chance.\n\u201cWhy would you? I\u2019ve never really done that. I don\u2019t really think about tournaments until I get there. What\u2019s the point? I don\u2019t see the point in over-analysing it.\n\u201cThe game still doesn\u2019t owe me anything and I wouldn\u2019t want it to, I want to go out and learn everything. If I don\u2019t win it [the Masters], I don\u2019t win it. It\u2019s not a life-changer for me. It\u2019s a golf tournament. It would be awesome and would put me in a place, in the game that I play, of very rare company. Wonderful. But I\u2019m not going to cry myself to sleep if I don\u2019t. I think people want to believe it consumes me but it doesn\u2019t. That\u2019s the truth. I think people want to believe it\u2019s the first thing I think of when I wake up and the last thing before I go to bed. And it\u2019s not, life\u2019s too short. I\u2019ve been very good over the last 18 months at staying in the present. If I build things up too much they can backfire.\u201d\nMcIlroy is equally candid when discussing his emotions at Augusta last year. He was frustrated at not being competitive, a feeling intensified by the prospect of answering questions about Tiger Woods\u2019s epic win for months to come. The cloud lifted sharply.\n\u201cI wanted to get out of there,\u201d he says. \u201cIt had been a disappointing week, I wanted to get home. I removed myself from it and thought: \u2018Jesus, this is unbelievable.\u2019 The longer Tiger is at the top of the game, the better it is for all of us. I messaged him. Anytime I win a tournament or have a chance, he is the first one to text me. All the time. So I always make sure if he is doing anything, that I\u2019m right there.\u201d\nThe pre-Masters stories around McIlroy had been amusing. The admission that meditation and mindfulness were now part of his routine raised eyebrows. He seemed a tad baffled. \u201cOnce I get into things I really get into things. I enjoy reading, I enjoy self-help, I enjoy psychology. I can be portrayed as anything, I don\u2019t care. I know who I am.\u201d\nIt seems astonishing to think nine years have passed since he threw up his hands in despair during rough weather at Royal St George\u2019s. The Open is scheduled to return to the Kent course this year but is shrouded in doubt. \u201cI was a lot younger and back then I wasn\u2019t good at embracing a challenge or adversity,\u201d McIlroy says.\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be the common answer but that\u2019s never who I\u2019ve been. I was impulsive and speaking off the cuff. I played 13 holes in brutal conditions. I got a great draw at Hoylake when I won [in 2014] so, swings and roundabouts.\u201d\nGolf has missed McIlroy in that major-winning scene. The US PGA marks the last of his four triumphs. There are mitigating circumstances but they matter not, including to the player himself. \u201cI am obviously good enough, I can win World Golf Championships and FedEx Cups. If we played 100-round tournaments I would come out on top every time as shown by my stroke average, strokes gained and stats. But tournaments are over four. It\u2019s putting those four together.\u201d\nMcIlroy may be afforded this year\u2019s Masters shot in the autumn. It is such a shame - relatively of course - that for now he is denied the opportunity when his form is so formidable. The grin returns when he contemplates whether any aspect of Portrush can be directly relevant at Augusta National. \u201cAt least if I hit it left off that tee, I\u2019ll be all right \u2026\u201d The thrill will be in standing there in the first place.",

        "content": "Care workers and homes report insufficient PPE and lack of clear government guidance\nBritain\u2019s care homes are in danger of being overwhelmed by the coronavirus, with staff warning they are at \u201cbreaking point\u201d and the country\u2019s biggest charitable provider revealing confirmed or suspected cases in more than half of its facilities.\nMHA, which runs more than 220 facilities, said 750 of its staff \u2013 more than one in 10 \u2013 are unable to work, and that confirmed deaths from the disease are rising.\nUnison, which represents care workers, on Tuesday called on Boris Johnson to intervene and end severe shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) in the care sector, which houses more than 400,000 of the UK\u2019s most elderly and vulnerable people.\nOn 25 March, the prime minister promised sufficient PPE would arrive with care workers by the end of last week. But MHA said on Tuesday that its staff were regularly using up their week\u2019s supply of face masks from the government in a single day, and nine of its homes have \u201cdangerously low\u201d amounts of kit.\nA survey of 10 care homes in the Barking, east London, constituency of the Labour MP Margaret Hodge on Monday also found that eight were struggling with shortages, particularly of goggles.\nThe leader of Unison, Dave Prentis, told Johnson in a letter that public workers lacking PPE \u201cfeel like they\u2019ve been forgotten \u2013 their safety a mere afterthought, despite the critical work they do\u201d.\nCare workers are also calling on the government to issue clearer guidelines to care home managers about how to stop the virus spreading. Workers have described despair and rising anxiety at seeing staff and residents mix with people confirmed to have Covid-19, and feeling as if they were being treated as \u201ccannon fodder\u201d.\nThese issues emerged as the Office of National Statistics released the first data about suspected or confirmed Covid-19 deaths outside hospitals. This suggested that, up to 20 March, a fifth of all confirmed and suspected deaths happened in care homes, hospices, domestic homes and other locations.\nLittle has been known about the death toll of coronavirus in care settings, because daily figures released by Public Health England only relate to NHS hospital fatalities. The number of deaths from confirmed coronavirus cases in hospitals rose by 381 to 1,789 on Tuesday.\n\u201cThe adult social care sector must not be treated as the poor relation of the NHS,\u201d said Sam Monaghan, the chief executive of MHA, which has recorded nine confirmed deaths from coronavirus in its homes, with many more suspected.\n\u201cOur people are also working day and night with those who are most vulnerable to coronavirus and we are yet to be included in the testing that is being rolled out for the NHS,\u201d he said. \u201cThis and [PPE] needs addressing urgently so we can keep our staff and those we care for safe. We are anxious that we may see an increase in staff expressing concern about coming into work without being supplied with adequate equipment.\u201d\nA care assistant in a 20-person care home \u2013 not operated by MHA \u2013 in south Wales told the Guardian that staff had been frightened after doctors asked each resident if they would prefer to stay in the home if they contract Covid-19, and all said they wanted to stay.\n\u201cWe have thermometers, that\u2019s it,\u201d she said. \u201cHow do we contain it in a home? We have people with dementia and we can\u2019t keep them in their rooms. All we have for PPE is the generic paper mask, gloves and plastic aprons. We are risking our lives. It makes us feel like we are cannon fodder.\u201d\nAnother carer at a home in Edinburgh said he was reduced to tears last Friday, when he realised staff looking after a resident with Covid-19 were also looking after another resident, and people were coming and going from the area where the infected person was staying.\n\u201cThe manager said they didn\u2019t know what the protocol was,\u201d he said. Staff were \u201ca bundle of nerves\u201d and \u201cso stressed\u201d, he said, adding that he had cried in the toilet in a rage about \u201ca lack of clarity about how we should proceed with all of this\u201d.\nWorkers have told Unison that some managers are either refusing to issue face masks or not providing training in how to use them, and not supplying hand sanitiser, causing anxiety that staff may infect their families and spread the virus among the people they care for. Unison said some carers have reported being asked to work even if they have underlying health issues, and to bring their children in to work if they cannot arrange childcare.\nOn Tuesday, Hodge wrote to the health secretary, Matt Hancock, demanding urgent action to supply more PPE, improve food supplies and prioritise testing so self-isolating care workers can get back to work.\n\u201cThe government must act faster to protect both the most vulnerable people in our communities and care home staff,\u201d she said. \u201cThe pronouncements they are making in parliament and the situation on the ground simply doesn\u2019t add up.\u201d\nTwo care homes in her constituency said they had no hand sanitiser, and two said that staff members had been threatened by members of the public when trying to bulk-buy in supermarkets to feed their residents. Several said they lacked PPE, with one saying they were borrowing plastic goggles from a local school.\nThe Department for Health and Social Care said it knew supplying PPE to carers was \u201cfundamental\u201d to the coronavirus response and that no wholesaler had been asked to prioritise the NHS over care homes. It said it was working \u201crapidly\u201d with wholesalers to ensure a longer-term supply of PPE and that care managers struggling for kit should alert the health department\u2019s national supply disruption response team, which can suggest alternative suppliers or arrange emergency deliveries.\n \u201cWe are working around the clock to give the social care sector the equipment and support they need to tackle this outbreak,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cWe have provided PPE equipment to over 26,000 care homes including home care and hospices across the country. The full weight of the government is behind this effort and we are working closely with industry and social care providers to make sure care staff have the protection they need to continue to deliver care safely.\u201d",

Plus, how to adapt our public rituals\nGood morning, this is James Murray bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Wednesday 1 April.\nStrict new \u201cstay at home\u201d measures are now in place across Australia, and they vary in each state and territory. People who leave their home for reasons not on the exception list could face fines of up to $11,000 in NSW and $1,600 in Victoria. The new powers have raised civil liberties concerns among human rights advocates, who say people must be given additional latitude to comply with the fast-changing rules. And Guardian Australia has revealed that 10% of the country\u2019s coronavirus cases are from the Ruby Princess cruise ship. As of Monday, at least 440 passengers across six states and two territories had tested positive for Covid-19 after disembarking from the cruise ship, which docked twice in Sydney in March. There are now more than 4,500 cases of Covid-19 in Australia.\nMore than 285,000 Australian businesses and sole traders have already applied for the government\u2019s new jobkeeper payments, and industries continue to push for more assistance.  The retail industry has asked for more casuals to be included in jobkeeper payments and Australian airlines have demanded as much as $5.6bn to keep them afloat through the pandemic. The government announced yesterday that it would support the ravaged seafood export trade with $110m to create a new freight assistance mechanism. Private hospitals, who were worried they would be subsumed by coronavirus demands without being able to make money from elective surgeries, are also being assisted, with half of the cost of them being integrated into the Covid-19 response being met by the government.\nThe global death toll from coronavirus now exceeds 40,000, with most coming from Italy and then Spain. The US is in third place, overtaking China with 3,415 deaths \u2013 but there are doubts about the accuracy of both countries\u2019 figures. The US was slow to start widespread testing and it\u2019s suspected China has hidden the true extent of its outbreak. Similar data reporting concerns have been registered in the UK, where 1,789 people have now died. A record 381 people, including an otherwise healthy 19-year-old, died yesterday in NHS hospitals. New statistics suggest the UK has underreported the number of coronavirus deaths by almost 24%.\nNew York state governor Andrew Cuomo says the bidding war for ventilators in America is like \u201cbeing on eBay\u201d.  Meanwhile, Detroit is bracing for a surge of coronavirus cases as experts say poverty rates and the prevalence of chronic disease make residents vulnerable. The city appears to be showing a steeper curve for infections than New York. A car park turned homeless shelter in Las Vegas has sparked criticism among locals. Photos of the temporary shelter showing people sleeping close to each other on the ground, some within arm\u2019s reach, sparked backlash on social media. And Chris McGreal looks at the difficulties of trying to combat Covid-19 with a profit-based health system. He reports from the Kansas city of Wellington where the only local hospital just shut its doors because it was losing money.\nMass bleaching seen along the Great Barrier Reef could mark the start of a global-scale event, according to the head of a US government agency program that monitors the globe\u2019s coral reefs. Rising ocean temperatures could have pushed the world\u2019s tropical coral reefs over a tipping point where they are hit by bleaching on a near-annual basis, Dr Mark Eakin, coordinator of Coral Reef Watch at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, told Guardian Australia.\nAustralians in their 20s have more cases of Covid-19 than any other age group. Some 11.3% of Covid-19 cases are among people aged 25 to 29, followed by 9.5% in those aged 60 to 65: the cruise ship cohort.\nA Queensland government health panel has recommended the legalisation of euthanasia. A year-long investigation to gauge public opinion on voluntary euthanasia has determined that most Queenslanders are in favour of it.\nNearly one in five of Australia\u2019s big polluting industrial sites increased emissions above government-set limits last financial year. Combined, they emitted about 790,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide over the limit.\nThe US says it will lift sanctions on Venezuela if president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his opponent Juan Guaid\u00f3 step aside and pass power to an interim government made up of their supporters. Sceptics of the plan said it provided few incentives for the incumbent officials to give up power.\nChina is reporting mixed results in its attempts to lift lockdown measures put in place to stem the tide of Covid-19. Fugong fuchan (\u201cresuming work, resuming production\u201d), the government mantra of the past few weeks, has proceeded in fits and starts.\nA crowd-sourced art project has captured the sounds of the world\u2019s deserted cities. Highlights include an anti-coronavirus song from Senegal, applause for health workers ringing out in Paris and the return of the dawn chorus in Warsaw.\nPeter C Baker asks the question on everyone\u2019s lips: how will coronavirus change the world? For some the pandemic presents an opportunity for a better, more secure, equitable world, while others fear the shock will just make existing injustices worse. \u201cEverything feels new, unbelievable, overwhelming. At the same time, it feels as if we\u2019ve walked into an old recurring dream,\u201d writes Baker, before going on to explore a world transformed by the virus.\nOne thing that has already changed, albeit temporarily, is the way we conduct public rituals such as weddings, birthdays and funerals. With so many governments placing tight restrictions on the number of people who can gather in one place, people are having to find new ways to mark these moments in life. Eleanor Gordon-Smith reports on some of the more innovative examples, including the story of a man who met his grandson for the first time as he was held up to a glass window in a hospital.\nLabor\u2019s treasury spokesperson Jim Chalmers writes about what Australia will be like post-virus.

        "content": "The state is in a race against time to secure enough breathing machines for coronavirus patients \u2013 just as the governor\u2019s brother has tested positive\nAndrew Cuomo, the governor of New York, has condemned the US federal government for fueling an \u201ceBay\u201d-style bidding war for ventilators as the coronavirus outbreak intensifies. Cuomo also spoke of his brother Chris\u2019s infection.\nThe governor said on Tuesday New York, the worst-hit state, had confirmed nearly 76,000 Covid-19 cases and 1,550 deaths.\nThe state government is racing against time to secure enough breathing machines before an infection apex, expected in the next 14 to 21 days.\nCuomo has walked a fine line between thanking Donald Trump for the federal government\u2019s support and offering subtle criticisms of his approach.\nAt his daily press briefing in Albany on Tuesday, Cuomo described a \u201cbizarre situation\u201d in which every state buys its own ventilators, pitting them against each other in bidding war.\n\u201cYou have 50 states competing to buy the same item,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe all wind up bidding up each other and competing against each other, where you now literally will have a company call you up and say, \u2018Well, California just outbid you.\u2019 It\u2019s like being on eBay with 50 other states, bidding on a ventilator.\u201d\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) was making matters worse, Cuomo added.\n\u201cHow inefficient! And then Fema gets involved and Fema starts bidding. And now Fema is bidding on top of the 50. So Fema is driving up the price. What sense does this make?\n\u201cThe federal government, Fema, should have been the purchasing agent: buy everything and then allocate by need to the states. Why would you create a situation where the 50 states are competing with each other and then the federal government and Fema comes in and competes with the rest of it?\u201d\nWithout attacking Trump directly, the governor added: \u201cAnyone could\u2019ve told you a lot of these things \u2026 did you really have to learn that 50 states shouldn\u2019t compete against 50 states, and then Fema shouldn\u2019t come in late and compete with 50 states? It\u2019s not like you had to go to the Harvard Kennedy school to learn this.\u201d\nA shortage of ventilators is one of the biggest crises facing the US as the number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 passes that of China and the death toll exceeds 3,000 \u2013 more than that of the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania. Carmakers such as Ford and General Motors are mass-producing the machines but Trump has been criticised for a slow and piecemeal response.\nTrump told a press briefing on Tuesday the federal government had held 10,000 back, in a stockpile.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to give them because we don\u2019t know where the emergency \u2013 this hits \u2013 it hits, like, so fast,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt comes so quickly. And we have 10,000. We\u2019re probably going to send some of them now.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cWe\u2019ve been sending a lot to Michigan and various other states. We\u2019ll probably send some additional ones to Michigan. New York has been doing very well, but we can add some more to New York. We\u2019re adding them to the areas that are having a problem.\n\u201cEven Alabama, all of a sudden, flared up a little bit, as you saw the last couple of days, and we\u2019ll send them down to Alabama. So, we have 10,000. We kept them for this very specific purpose.\u201d\nThe pandemic has now hit close to home for Cuomo, who has earned widespread praise for his leadership during the pandemic. The governor said his younger brother and \u201cbest friend\u201d, the CNN host Chris Cuomo, had tested positive.\n\u201cWe found out this morning,\u201d Andrew Cuomo said. \u201cHe is going to be fine, he\u2019s young, strong, not as strong as he thinks \u2026 but he will be fine. I spoke to him this morning and he is going to be quarantined in his basement.\u201d\nThe revelation came after Cuomo said New Yorkers who had tested positive for the coronavirus increased by more than 9,000 from a day earlier to 75,795, with deaths rising to 1,550 from 1,218.\n\u201cThe virus is more powerful, more dangerous than we expected,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re still going up the mountain; the main battle is on top of the mountain.\u201d\nSome New York City hospitals have been overwhelmed, with medical staff speaking of hellish conditions and a chronic lack of resources. A temporary hospital built inside the Javits conference center has begun accepting patients. A US navy hospital ship was expected to take in patients as early as Tuesday.\nThe US government is building makeshift hospitals as the US marked 700 deaths in a single day from Covid-19 for the first time on Tuesday.\nNew York City\u2019s mayor, Bill de Blasio, pleaded for reinforcements from the Trump administration, saying the worst could still be weeks away.\n\u201cThis is the point at which we must be prepared for next week, when we expect a huge increase in the number of cases. What I asked very clearly, last week, was for military medical personnel to be deployed here,\u201d De Blasio said at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Queens, where a field hospital was being built.\nDe Blasio said he had asked the White House for an additional 1,000 nurses, 300 respiratory therapists and 150 doctors by 5 April but had yet to receive an answer.\nReuters contributed to this report",

Barclays said the decision to scrap the 2019 payout was \u201cin response to a request from the UK Prudential Regulation Authority and to preserve additional capital for use in serving Barclays\u2019 customers and clients\u201d.\nBarclays\u2019s chairman, Nigel Higgins said: \u201cThese are difficult decisions, not least in terms of the immediate impact they will have on shareholders. The bank has a strong capital base, but we think it is right and prudent, for the many businesses and people that we support, to take these steps now, and ensure that Barclays is well placed to continue doing what we can to help through this crisis.\u201d\nBusiness email sign-upThe scrapping of a \u00a3968m payout by by Royal Bank of Scotland due on 4 May will also hit government coffers. The lender, which is still 62% owned by the taxpayer, was sent to hand around \u00a3600m worth of dividends to the Treasury.\nThreadneedle Street\u2019s announcement come after it faced mounting pressure to follow in the footsteps of the European Central Bank, which last week urged lenders to stop dividend payments and share buybacks until at least 1 October.\nThe head of the Bank of International Settlements \u2013 referred to as the central banks\u2019 central bank \u2013 also came out against bank dividends this week, saying it would be irresponsible for banks to hand money to shareholders given the poor economic outlook.",

In addition, they say 177,857 people who were infected have since recovered.\nRelatives of Ismail Mohamed Abdulwahab, from Brixton in south London, said they were \u201cbeyond devastated\u201d by his death in the early hours of Monday (BST), adding that he had died without any family members close by because of his infection.\nHe is believed to be the UK\u2019s youngest victim and, while his relatives are awaiting the results of a postmortem, he is not thought to have had any underlying health problems.\nThe country\u2019s health authorities announced an increase of 499 deaths of patients in its hospitals on Tuesday; the biggest rise since the start of the pandemic.\nSlovakia registered its first death since the outbreak began, according to its National Health Information Centre. As of midnight on Monday, Slovakia had 363 confirmed cases of coronavirus infection.\nOman\u2019s health ministry announced the country\u2019s first death \u2013 that of a 72-year-old Omani man \u2013 state TV reported.

One, aged 56 years, had recently returned from neighbouring Rwanda and the other, aged 42, had recently returned from Dubai, the government said.\nThe UK\u2019s biggest banks agreed to scrap payouts to shareholders and are expected not to pay out any bonuses to senior staff. It comes after a request from the Bank of England. As the UK prepares for a potential recession, the step is described as a \u201csensible precautionary step given the unique role that banks need to play in supporting the wider economy through a period of economic disruption\u201d.\nThe world faces its most challenging crisis since the second world war, the UN\u2019s secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, warns.

        "content": "The economic contraction is expected to hit the professions hard in coming weeks\nA second wave of job losses from the professions could add to Australia\u2019s staggering economic toll from the coronavirus pandemic, as law firms, accountancy practices and consultants prepare plans to survive the downturn.\nWhile accountants, business advisers and lawyers have initially been busy helping clients with layoffs, shutdowns and emergency capital raising, the economic contraction is expected to hit these sectors hard in coming weeks.\nAnd the finance sector is next in line as plunging markets trash investment portfolios and slash the demand for financial advice.\nThe severity of the layoffs could be softened by the government\u2019s newly announced scheme to pay employers $1,500 a fortnight for each employee that stays employed.\nMost of the larger firms will need to show they have a 30% or 50% fall off in turnover, depending on size of turnover before the crisis.\nThere are an estimated 193,000 accountants in Australia, with the big four accounting and consulting firms accounting for more than 33,000 of those jobs.\nA 2014 census by the NSW Law Society put the number of solicitors at 66,211, with 41% of those in NSW, and 24.5% in Victoria.\nThe big professional organisations such as Deloitte, PwC, KPMG and EY are already moving to scale back their operations and cut partner draws as clients retreat.\nThe big four and many law firms were already well set up for remote working as consultants often work off-site or at their clients\u2019 offices so moved quickly to adapt their work practices. But now they are focusing on saving their own businesses.\nPartners\u2019 remuneration is being reduced, reportedly by between 15% to 50%, graduate programs have been suspended, discretionary spending slashed and most are reviewing staff numbers.\nStaff are also expect to be asked to take leave or work a four-day week as clients cut spending, especially on areas now seen to be optional.\nDeloitte, which has 11,000 staff in Australia, will shut down for a week in April, forcing the entire firm to take one week of annual leave, and has issued an urgent request for audit and assurance partners to quickly bill their clients.\nEY Australia, which employs more than 5,000 staff, told Guardian Australia it had had a crisis management team focused on Covid-19 since January.\n\u201cWe have enlisted the help of resilience experts to advise the leadership team, alongside medical and health experts, to support our people in the best possible way through these turbulent times,\u201d a spokesman said.\n\u201cWe have explained to our people that we don\u2019t have a crystal ball and there is significant uncertainty, and that explains our cuts to discretionary spending, the freeze on recruitment and reduced partner draws.\u201d\n\u201cWe have also been clear that to protect jobs we will redeploy our people to higher demand areas and provide options for people to modify their work arrangements or scale back hours,\u201d the firm said.\n\u201cAll of these measures are designed to avoid arriving at a place where we need to effect redundancies. However, where there is significant and prolonged downturn in demand, and redeployment is not possible, redundancy will be reluctantly applied as a last resort.\u201d\nAt mid-tier firm Grant Thornton, partners will take pay cuts of between 20% and 50%, while 95% of staff have agreed to cut their hours and pay from 1 April. The aim is to avoid or reduce the number of staff cuts required, CEO Greg Keith told the Australian Financial Review.\nIn the short term some niche areas in professional services have seen a surge in activity, notably helping firms prepare for insolvency and emergency capital raising.\nBut dealmaking, new capital raisings and spending on consultancies will stall as companies go into survival mode.\nCompanies are expected to slash work on areas such as climate change modelling and gender diversity, while governments are halting consulting work on policy areas.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of that fluffy consulting \u2013 people will say, uh, I don\u2019t need it,\u201d one big-four partner said.\nFallout from the economic shutdown imposed by the government to curb the spread of Covid-19 spread to the finance sector on Monday.\nBank of Queensland became the first bank to withdraw its profit guidance because of the coronavirus while insurance and advice companies said they had taken a heavy hit because the sharemarket has lost about a third of its value over the past month.\nChallenger, which offers life insurance and annuity products, said it had dumped shares, reducing them from 13% of the assets backing its life products to just 5%. Investors who have pumped $345m into high-interest notes issued by Challenger also got a nasty shock \u2013 the company won\u2019t be repurchasing them, as it usually does, and they will instead be converted into ordinary shares.\nInsurer QBE withdrew its profit forecasts. IAG said it was maintaining its profit forecasts but flagged a $100m loss in its investment portfolio since the end of the year, most of which took place in March.\nIn the legal profession, the social distancing rules are adding to the stresses of economic downturn, forcing courts to restrict hearings to the most urgent.\nMeanwhile, the courts are trying to keep operating, prioritising hearings for those in custody.\nThe New South Wales supreme court is continuing to operate but with no personal appearances in any matters, save in exceptional circumstances with the leave of the chief justice or head of jurisdiction.\nSupreme court bail callovers are now remote via telephone dial-in or video (over the internet). The accused appears via a videolink, as has been the case for some time.\nFrom 1 April 2020, the district court of NSW will temporarily suspend all new judge-alone trials, sentence hearings, local court appeals, arraignments and readiness hearings, where the defendant is not in custody.\n\u201cThis temporary suspension will be reviewed on 1 May 2020. The court will continue to hear to the extent and for as long as possible consistent with health advice, all criminal matters where the defendant is in custody, with the exception of new jury trials which remain temporarily suspended,\u201d chief judge Price said.\nIn the local court, measures are in place to limit attendance in the courts, with represented people no longer required to attend, limiting attendance to lawyers. Non-represented people are being encouraged to deal with the court via email, including entering pleas.\nDefended hearings are being pushed back for mention to the week of 4 May.\nOther states are taking similar steps to limit face to face appearances where possible, while still ensuring that people who are in custody are dealt with as swiftly as possible.",

It has since pulled into port in Guam, a US island territory in the western Pacific.\nA four-page letter, written by the ship\u2019s captain, describes a bleak situation onboard the nuclear-powered carrier as more sailors test positive for the virus.\nCaptain Brett Crozier, the ship\u2019s commanding officer, wrote that the carrier lacked enough quarantine and isolation facilities and warned the current strategy would slow but fail to eradicate the highly contagious respiratory virus.\nIn the letter dated Monday, he called for \u201cdecisive action\u201d and removing over 4,000 sailors from the ship and isolating them. Along with the ship\u2019s crew, naval aviators and others serve aboard the Roosevelt.\n\u201cWe are not at war. Sailors do not need to die. If we do not act now, we are failing to properly take care of our most trusted asset - our sailors,\u201d Crozier wrote.\nUS officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters that nearly 80 people aboard the ship had tested positive for the coronavirus, a number likely to increase as all personnel on the ship are tested.\nStill, the navy declined to confirm exactly how many people aboard the Roosevelt had been infected. The navy puts the ship\u2019s complement at 5,000, the equivalent of a small American town.\nThe letter was first reported by the San Francisco Chronicle and its contents have been confirmed by US officials to Reuters.\nThe letter does not say where the sailors would be evacuated to and did say that there would be \u201cchallenges\u201d in securing individual accommodation for his crew to safely quarantine themselves for 14 days. The island of Guam, where the carrier is docked, is the hotspot of Covid-19 in the Pacific region and is struggling to deal with the caseload it has.\nGuam has 58 confirmed cases of the coronavirus and has had two Covid-19-related deaths. The Pacific Daily News reports that local authorities have been promised more testing kits by the US government and are sourcing others from Asia, but there are fears the island is fast approaching capacity in its hospitals and deaths could increase.\nActing US navy secretary Thomas Modly said the navy had been working for several days to get the sailors off the ship in Guam. Modly said Guam did not have enough beds and the Navy was in talks with the local government to use hotels and set up tents.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t disagree with the [commanding officer] on that ship, and we\u2019re doing it in a very methodical way because it\u2019s not the same as a cruise ship ... that ship has armaments on it, it has aircraft on it,\u201d he said on CNN.\nUS defense secretary Mark Esper said on Tuesday it was not time to evacuate the carrier, adding he had not read the letter in detail.\nAdmiral John Aquilino, head of the US Navy\u2019s Pacific Fleet, told reporters that the plan was to take some sailors off the ship, test and quarantine them, clean the ship and then rotate them with those on the carrier.\nHe said that there would be some sailors who would be in quarantine and isolation on the vessel. Asked if he was following what the ship\u2019s captain wanted to do, but was not able to do it at the pace the commanding officer wanted, Aquilino said: \u201cThat is absolutely the case.\u201d\nReuters contributed to this report.",

A yellow code indicates that the holder should be in home isolation, and a red code says the user is a confirmed Covid-19 patient and should be in quarantine.\nThe apps have become an integral part of Chinese authorities\u2019 management of people and their movements in and out of affected areas. When lockdown restrictions in Hubei province were lifted last week, the government allowed residents with a green code to travel within and out of the province.\nSome restaurants, shops, hotels and other establishments ask for patrons to show their codes before entering. In Wuhan, only those with a green health code are allowed to take public transport.\nHowever, the technology has raised concerns about their reach into people\u2019s private lives and data.\nThere have been complaints by Chinese social media users about a lack of transparency over how the app works and what data it is storing. Some have reported being unable to change erroneous \u201cred\u201d designations, and questioned the reliance on internet connection and surveillance.\n\u201cWhy should you let companies such as Alipay and WeChat monitor and trace you with the health code?\u201d said one user.\n\u201cCan\u2019t it be integrated into the chip of our ID card? And some people\u2019s mobile phones are not connected to the internet. I don\u2019t know what leaders are thinking?\u201d\nThe apps rely on a combination of self-reporting by the user and government information, including a person\u2019s medical records, their travel history and if they have been in contact with someone diagnosed with Covid-19.\nAccording to screenshots of an English-language version of the Alipay app, applicants are asked for contact and passport details and recent travel, and for relevant medical certification. Ant Financial, an affiliate of Alibaba that operates Alipay, said that it does not provide or operate the service and has no access to the data entered into it. The company said it provided technical support to the Hangzhou city government when it was developing its version of the software.\nOfficial guidelines for the WeChat app say it takes basic identity and address details as well as \u201cthe history of close contact with suspected patients, history of travel and residence outside the resident\u201d.\nIt draws on medical information including \u201csymptoms (such as fever, cough), medical treatment, isolated observation, contact information, travel history of the epidemic area\u201d, and the user\u2019s travel history including the mode of travel and what seat they sat in, and details on the vehicle and its driver.\nThe health code app, launched in Hangzhou in early February, and described by state media as \u201cAlipay Health code\u201d spread to more than 100 cities within a week before it was rolled out nationally.\nAdditional reporting by Pei Lin Wu.",

And to deal with the climate emergency we need to leave the vast majority of the world\u2019s coal in the ground,\u201d he added.\nThe plan was rejected two years ago by Sajid Javid, the former minister for communities and local government, after an 18-month review concluded that the environmental impact of the mine would outweigh its economic benefits.\nThe decision was overturned by the High Court eight months later after a judge ruled that Javid\u2019s reasoning for disregarding the support of the planning inspectorate, which backed the project, was \u201csignificantly inadequate\u201d.\nThe Banks Group argues that mining coal domestically would have a smaller carbon footprint than importing coal by sea and rail. The same argument was put forward in favour of UK shale gas development, but failed to win over energy ministers who announced an indefinite moratorium on all fracking in England last year.",

The group had recently been labelled a terrorist organisation.\nNay Myo Lin, editor in chief of the Voice of Myanmar, could face life in prison. His website has also been blocked, along with other outlets that cover the ongoing fighting in Rakhine state, where about 730,000 Rohingya Muslims fled a military crackdown in 2017.\nPhil Robertson, deputy Asia director for Human Rights Watch described the charges as absurd. \u201cQuite clearly they are trying to get rid of any lines of reporting that they cannot control,\u201d he said.\nThe country\u2019s army has repeatedly filed cases against publications that cover the conflict, and only weeks ago dropped a recent criminal complaint it had filed against Reuters news agency.\nOn top of such legal action, Myanmar has also instructed mobile operators to block 221 websites, claiming they publish fake news and contribute towards instability in the country.\nThe crackdown on access to information adds to growing fears that communication blocks are making it hard to assess if Myanmar is complying a recent ruling by the international court of justice, which said that the country must implement \u201cprovisional measures\u201d to protect the Rohingya community in Rakhine state from genocidal acts.\n\u201cDespite the UN secretary general\u2019s call for a global ceasefire all around the world so that everybody can battle the Covid virus, you have the military in Myanmar doubling down on repressive actions to prevent any sort of independent information coming out of Rakhine state,\u201d added Robertson. \u201cIt indicates the Burmese military is certainly not listening to anything the UN secretary general has said.\u201d\nMyanmar, which reported its first death related to the virus on Tuesday, has registered 14 cases of the coronavirus. Just weeks ago the country had maintained that it was virus free, with one official stating that people\u2019s \u201clifestyle and diet\u201d protected them from infection.\nThe internet-freedom group Access Now, which tracks internet shutdowns worldwide, said that the blackouts first imposed on some townships in Myanmar\u2019s Rakhine and Chin state in June were now among the most prolonged on record.\nWhile violence in the two states has limited people\u2019s ability to move and access services, the internet blackout also \u201cprevents people from getting informed, protecting themselves and their loved ones, and stopping the spread of the virus throughout their communities,\u201d Access Now said in a statement earlier this month.\nReuters contributed to this report",

In that analysis, Long-Bailey and Nandy both came out with the maximum score of 100%. Starmer had only been present for two votes, meaning there was insufficient information for him to be given a score.\nIn a clear sign of how deeply embedded a radical environmental agenda has become in Labour policy, all three candidates, answering before the Covid 19 outbreak said the climate crisis was the biggest challenge facing the UK. Both Long-Bailey and Nandy highlighted their previous experience \u2013 Long-Bailey as the architect of Labour\u2019s Green New Deal at the last election and Nandy from her time as the party\u2019s shadow energy secretary and her role leading Labour\u2019s team at the Paris climate talks in 2015.\nAll the candidates pledged broad support for Labour\u2019s comprehensive Green New Deal agenda. Both Long-Bailey and Starmer supported the specifics of the plan set out in the 2019 manifesto, spelling out how the UK could rapidly decarbonise the economy and create hundreds of thousands of secure, unionised green jobs.\nStarmer said the project should be \u201chardwired\u201d into everything a future Labour government did \u201cfrom foreign policy to local government, from transport to housing\u201d, and he flagged up the role of the \u201cgreen transformation fund and a national investment bank\u201d to pay for it.\nLong-Bailey said that under her leadership Labour would organise and pay for such an ambitious scheme through public ownership and investment in the energy system to ensure \u201cextra costs are not loaded onto homes that can\u2019t afford it\u201d.\nNandy did not commit to the details of the plan but agreed there needed to be \u201ca wholesale transformation\u201d in the way homes and businesses were powered and heated, adding that \u201cthis is possible and necessary and offers huge economic opportunities\u201d.\nAsked whether they would commit to greater funding for public transport, cycling and walking than for road building, Long-Bailey said she would, saying it was necessary not just to tackle the climate crisis, but to improve \u201cour economy, the connections between cities and towns, and rural areas, making our public transport more accessible and to encourage healthier lives and cleaner air.\u201d\nNeither Nandy nor Starmer specifically committed to spending more on public transport, walking and cycling than roads although both said they would increase investment in those areas.\nNandy said she would nationalise the railways and hand over control of buses to local councils so they were run \u201cfor people not profit\u201d.\nStarmer said the government had made a \u201cpolitical choice to spend transport budgets on roads rather than greener and cheaper forms of transport\u201d.\nHe added: \u201cI would lead a Labour government with different priorities: building a more sustainable, affordable, accessible and integrated transport system \u2013 with investment in bus services, renationalisation of our railways, and support for cycling and pedestrians.\u201d\nAll the candidates expressed interest in a frequent flyer tax to ensure that the 15% of wealthy UK residents who are estimated to take 70% of domestic and international flights pay more for the environmental damage they cause.\nNandy said she would look to \u201cmake the system fairer and greener\u201d. Long-Bailey said it was right to \u201cask wealthy frequent flyers to shoulder more responsibility, or reduce the frequency of their flights\u201d.\nStarmer said the tax system should encourage people to use alternatives to flying.\nAll three said they were opposed to expansion at Heathrow and were sceptical about aviation expansion elsewhere in light of the UK\u2019s legal commitments to reduce carbon emissions.\nNone of the candidates came out against nuclear power. Long-Bailey said she supported it where necessary for the UK\u2019s \u201cenergy security\u201d. Nandy said that the middle of a climate emergency was the wrong time to rule it out definitively. Starmer said nuclear power should be \u201cpart of the mix\u201d in the transition away from fossil fuels, but the \u201coverwhelming focus\u201d should be on renewables.\nAsked whether they would support policies to reduce red meat consumption, Nandy said the focus should be on the fossil fuel industry. \u201cThe priority for governments must be to focus on the biggest driver of emissions, which is the global fossil fuel industry; but the Committee on Climate Change has made it clear that we also need to think about how we manage our land and produce our food.\u201d\nLong-Bailey highlighted the growing number of people who are cutting down on red meat \u201cas people think about the environment and their health\u201d, but stopped short of any specific policy commitments.\nStarmer acknowledged that the meat and dairy sector was \u201cone of the most significant contributors to climate change and, in many countries, deforestation\u201d, adding that everyone should think about how to reduce their consumption.\nBut he added: \u201cChanges in behaviour, important as they are, should not distract us from the systemic nature of the problem of climate change.\u201d\nNandy said tackling the climate emergency went \u201chand-in-hand with restoring our natural environment\u201d. She backed Labour\u2019s existing policy of creating 10 new national nature parks, adding: \u201cI would also enable more people to take control of the management of their local parks, and ensure that local government had the powers and funding to maintain them.\u201d\nStarmer agreed rewilding was an essential part of the \u201cfightback against the climate and environmental emergency\u201d.\n\u201cI support ambitious tree-planting schemes and new nature parks to halt the devastating loss of biodiversity and to help in the fight against air pollution which plagues our streets.\u201d\nLong-Bailey also backed Labour\u2019s existing plans to create new parks and rewild existing ones, as well as \u201cnatural corridors\u201d across the country.\n\u201cThese are examples of actions we need to take to tackle the climate crisis, but will also make our cities, towns and local communities nicer and healthier places to live, bringing public luxury to the spaces and services we care about.\u201d",

        "content": "My 93-year old mum is in a care home, but Dad relies on care workers and a home help visiting him three times a day. What happens if they get sick?\nSupporting two very old parents, especially when you live some distance away, brings challenges at the best of times.\nFor the last couple of years, I\u2019ve been ordering Mum and Dad\u2019s weekly online shopping from Sainsbury\u2019s, making sure the pharmacy has delivered their medicines, arranging menus from Wiltshire Farm Foods, checking their care workers have turned up, trying to pop over for a social visit every other weekend, and phoning nearly every day. We\u2019ve often joked I have a second job, as their personal assistant.\nBut in the current crisis, the safety net I\u2019ve tried to build around them over the years is full of potential holes. Reports from Spain of staff abandoning a retirement home do little to qualm fears, though I can\u2019t imagine that would happen here. But reports that some care homes in the UK can\u2019t get hold of enough food are a little alarming.\nSo far, my parents have been getting excellent support \u2013 Mum in a nursing home, Dad in the family home. But what happens if their care staff get sick?\nLast November, my 93-year-old mum spent two months in hospital. She eventually moved to a nursing home in Thurrock, Essex, owned by the Runwood Homes Group, in late January.\nThe home closed its doors to unnecessary visits on 9 March, ahead of government advice. I managed to see Mum just before the ban came into effect. \u201cThere\u2019s not much you can do about it, is there?\u201d she said, with a stoicism that reminded me she survived the blitz.\nMum\u2019s nursing home is doing all it can to ensure highest infection control measures are in place, which is reassuring. Staff have to change into clean uniforms at work and must not wear them outside the homes, says Alyssa Kelleher, spokeswoman for the Runwood Group, which runs 70 nursing, residential and specialist care homes across the UK.\nEach home has been issued protective masks by the government and the group is also trying to source more fluid-repellent face-masks and gloves itself. \u201cWe would like to have more stock as soon as possible for protection,\u201d says Kelleher. \u201cCurrently, masks are only being used in a suspected or confirmed case, which we\u2019ve had none of so far.\n\u201c[We] check the temperatures of every resident and staff member daily,\u201d she adds.\nRunwood buys food on a group-wide basis, so it can boost supplies to homes where there may be a shortfall. It has also devised a \u201cno-cook\u201d menu of pre-cooked food that any member of staff can prepare if catering staff become ill.\nKeeping residents\u2019 morale high is also important. \u201cHomes have seen some external entertainers performing outside their windows,\u201d Kelleher adds, \u201cwhile local communities have been invited to contact residents with letters, pictures and postcards.\u201d\nBoth Dad and I feel happy that Mum is as safe as possible, and that she is comfortable. My bigger concern is Dad, 92, who is supported by a team of care workers from Manorcourt Homecare, an agency that has 12 branches providing domiciliary care across the east of England, including Thurrock.\nDad\u2019s care arrangements work well. The morning care workers wash, dress and toilet him, and prepare his breakfast. The frozen meals delivered every week are heated up daily by the lunchtime care worker, who also prepares his teatime snack. He gets an evening visit to prepare him for bed. Dad also has some additional support from Age UK home helps, who clean the house, wash clothes and bedding, and generally offer social support.\nBut what happens if this fragile network of care workers breaks down as staff start to get sick or need to self-isolate? Will a time come when he doesn\u2019t get the crucial help in the mornings?\nAnd, given the number of people coming through his home, is he \u2013 and are his care workers \u2013 putting themselves at added risk of catching coronavirus?\nSo far, so good. Although one of Dad\u2019s usual Age UK home helps had to self-isolate last week, someone else came instead. I\u2019ve made sure Dad has hand gel strategically placed for his care workers to use if they wish. \u201cBut most are washing their hands,\u201d he tells me. \u201cThey have told me they\u2019ve been given gel to use. And some have started wearing masks.\u201d\n\u201cWe are closely monitoring all clients and any changes to their health,\u201d says Janice King, operations director at Manorcourt Homecare. \u201cWe are also conscious of every client\u2019s mental wellbeing \u2013 it\u2019s a hugely unsettling time and our care workers may be the only person they are now seeing day to day. We are doing all that we can to keep our clients and care workers safe during these unprecedented times.\u201d\nThe agency has always prioritised its clients under a RAG (red, amber, green) system, adjusting services as necessary if staffing levels drop. It continues to do that now.\n\u201cIf someone is living in isolation and has no family or friends support network around them, or perhaps a client has an urgent medication that needs administering at specific times of the day, they would be rated red and therefore a priority for our care workers,\u201d King explains. \u201cSocial visits and those clients with supportive families close by would be rated green.\u201d\nClients with family living nearby or even living in the same household would be approached to see what help they might be able to offer if necessary.\nIf staffing levels should drop significantly, they would reduce the amount of time spent with a client, or the office-based staff (all of them trained in practical care) will go out on a visit. In Dad\u2019s case, the Thurrock branch has 10 office staff who could provide cover as needed. If care workers need to remind a client to take their medication, they might phone rather than visit in person. Ultimately, says King, they\u2019d call on social services for support if they had to reduce services to a client who was extremely high risk.\nWhile Manorcourt Homecare routinely trains its staff to work with personal protection equipment (PPE), including gloves, aprons, arm sleeves, foot covers and masks, ensuring there is enough of it is a worry, says King. \u201cWe are fortunate that we continue to have a supply of PPE equipment in every branch office and all frontline staff have the appropriate PPE for every client they visit,\u201d she says. \u201cOur concern is to ensure that stocks are maintained and so our office team is working hard to ensure these supplies continue to reach us and can be distributed across all of our different locations.\u201d\nKeeping staff safe, well and working is a high priority for both agencies. They are keen to promote their increased recruitment drives, as they need to find new staff who can cover should existing staff get sick. Both Manorcourt and Runwood are recruiting new care assistants, and Runwood also has vacancies for nurses, domestic staff and wellbeing/activity leads.\nBut getting sick is not something these care workers will want to do. No one does this job for the money: the rate of pay is around \u00a39-\u00a310 an hour. Neither company offers occupational sick pay \u2013 the care workers are only entitled to the statutory minimum, which is \u00a394.25 a week for both sickness and self-isolation.\nNo doubt other people like me, who have frail, elderly parents, are wondering what they\u2019ll do if a parent\u2019s care package should break down.\nI can\u2019t do much about my mum given she is in a home, but I\u2019ve already told my dad and the team at Manorcourt I\u2019d help out if needed. But restrictions on travel may make it difficult for me to drive the 25 miles to his home each day from London, potentially spreading the virus.\nMaybe I\u2019ll just have to move back into my childhood home. I\u2019m rather hoping it won\u2019t have to come to that. But in these extraordinary times, anything is possible.",

        "content": "Viktor Orb\u00e1n is using the pandemic to seize more power. This backsliding could permanently change the face of the EU\nTo say that Europe is united by its divisions is an exaggeration \u2013 but only a small one. Closing national borders during the pandemic may have been a rational health response, but the longer term political consequences become more troubling when we look at the order in which European governments began to reimpose frontiers.\nItaly made the decision on 10 March, when the number of confirmed cases had already exceeded 10,000. Over the next five days, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Poland, and Hungary closed their borders one after the other, even though by that time in any of them the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases had not reach a hundred.\nAs a first impulse, suspending the Schengen border-free zone after years of free movement is understandable. Leaders naturally wanted to act quickly to avoid a dramatic Italian scenario in their territories. Bear in mind, though, that these decisions to limit the free movement of people were made by politicians not by doctors. Just as when Donald Trump imposed his European travel ban selectively at first, the closing of frontiers in central and eastern Europe has a political significance that goes beyond mere sanitary demands. Politics in the time of plague is still politics. (This is why, by the way, the the much-discussed \u201creturn of the expert\u201d is a fantasy, at best wishful thinking.)\nThis is Europe is a new stream of Guardian journalism that investigates the big challenges that transcend national boundaries, and seeks out the solutions that could benefit us all. These are testing times, and crises are not limited by national borders. But then neither are we. \nThe sequence in which the Schengen provisions were suspended in central and eastern Europe tells us something important about societies in this region and perhaps even about the EU in general.\nFirst, there is the collective psychological dimension. The question of borders here is not just about geography or history, it is an existential one. For decades, post-communist countries have sought to escape Soviet influence in order to \u201creturn to Europe\u201d. The reasons were only partially economic. In all those memorable pictures of the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989, one can see crowds of east Germans who believed they were literally escaping the trap of history. Poles, Hungarians, Czechs and many other nations felt the same. In the 20th century, their central experience was that of cyclical collapse of their states, downfall of sovereignty and existential threat coming from two totalitarian systems. Their desire to join organisations such as Nato or the EU after the collapse of communism derived from their view that the west was a guarantor of institutional stability and personal safety. Joining the Schengen zone in particular, was seen as a way of finally leaving the geopolitical danger zone.\nThose countries should theoretically then have been the last, not the first, to close their borders in 2020. One of the reasons for this is that \u201creturning to Europe\u201d brought on the one hand modernisation and prosperity, but on the other a profound cost. One outcome of Schengen has been the mass emigration of well-educated workers.\nThe brain drain of doctors has contributed to the dramatic situation facing many healthcare systems in the region. Long before the pandemic, Hungary had considered special contracts for young doctors to stop them emigrating en masse. In Poland, according to official OECD and Eurostat data, the number of practicing physicians per 1,000 inhabitants is only 2.4. Whenthe UK announced new recruitment for the NHS of doctors from the EU, the understanding in Poland was that Britain\u2019s target was not France or Germany but farther east. Closing the borders has in fact been in the central and eastern European air for quite some time and the arrival of Covid-19 is just a catalyst.\nIn spite of their extraordinary transformation since 1989 the post-communist states are also still perceived (including by their own citizens) as weak. True or false, this provokes neurotic reactions to almost any political threat. Radical political language and radical measures are taken because fear of another collapse of the state is still deep rooted. These real anxieties may gradually be eroding faith in joint EU solutions, such as the Schengen zone, which were previously seen as benign.\nThe same reasons may explain why, for example, the response of Poles to their lockdown has turned out to be so disciplined and relatively well organised. If the state is weak \u2013 including the healthcare system \u2013 we want to stay at home and where possible organise for others. Voluntary networks in Poland cooking free meals for doctors or preparing additional Covid-19 tests are examples of such behaviour.\nThere is therefore something of a perverse relief to the closing of borders in central and eastern European countries because of the pandemic. It might be only a fleeting feeling that will soon give way to a longing for European normality. However, it could also be the other way around.\nThe second point relates to the way in which exceptional powers are a source of immense temptation for politicians, especially the illiberal populists in our part of Europe. Could they resist the lure of this extraordinary centralisation of power?\nIn our city, Warsaw, like others around the globe, almost total silence reigns; drones take photographs of empty streets from above. But silence in the public sphere matters. In classical political philosophy it was associated with the danger of despotism. In The Spirit of the Laws Montesquieu writes about the deadly silence in the cities when the enemy is scaling the walls. Our adversary today has no legions. It is invisible \u2013 but that does not mean it is less threatening. Contrary to democracy, characterised by a robust and lively public sphere, in despotism people\u2019s interests and activities shift to the private sphere, where they focus on material goods and forget about the community. This threatens democracy, because while people are preoccupied, irreversible changes can be made to the political system.\nSilence in the public sphere will not be compensated for by the din online. In a more romantic era we thought the web and social media would give citizens better tools and make them more active. Today the passivity of citizen-followers is a well-established phenomenon, and our worries are about privacy and the lack of regulation of tech platforms. It is hard to assume that the internet will automatically become a remedy for the deserted public sphere.\nThe spectre of a sanitary cataclysm effectively pushes democracy to the sidelines. In those countries where respect for democracy has been established over many years, it does not have to be dangerous. But things look different in places where illiberal populists have already started to translate the 2020 health emergency as the victory of the nation-state over a helpless EU, and the liberal rules-based multilateral order. In Hungary Viktor Orb\u00e1n has been allowed to rule by decree during this state of emergency without any clear time limit and special measures include jail terms for spreading misinformation. Since 1989 no politician has been so powerful in the region.\nIn Poland, the government changed the electoral law overnight to make sure the 10 May presidential elections go ahead, hoping that the only candidate able to organise a campaign is the current president, Andrzej Duda. Attempts are also being made to stop doctors from criticising the performance of the healthcare system in the face of the pandemic. And in Slovakia, citizens are expressing worries that the special measures introduced by the government will give it uncontrolled access to personal information.\nOur collective quarantine could last for weeks or months. In parts of central and eastern Europe there is a threat that it will end in consolidating the illiberal order to an extent difficult to predict. Even from behind their closed borders, illiberal leaders can inspire each other. For, yes, coronavirus can also affect political regimes. And it could permanently change the face of the EU.\n Jaros\u0142aw Kuisz is a historian, editor-in-chief of the Polish weekly Kultura Liberalna and a fellow at the Institute of Advanced Studies in Berlin\n Karolina Wigura is a historian, political editor of the Polish weekly Kultural Liberalna and a fellow at the Institute of Advanced Studies in Berlin",

        "content": "Calls grow to amend exam requirements and ease stress on year 11 and 12 students\nAustralian universities are changing traditional admission policies amid growing calls for state education authorities to amend requirements for students caught up in the coronavirus pandemic during their final year of schooling.\nYear 12 students across the country head into the Easter holidays with little certainty about how assessments will progress if school closures continue into the next term.\nWhile some state governments have announced changes to final-year assessments, ministers were unable to agree on the makeup of end-of-year exams at an education council meeting last week.\n\u201cMinisters agreed that it is important that no senior secondary student is disadvantaged,\u201d the education council said after the meeting. \u201cFuture decisions will ensure equitable outcomes for all senior secondary students as they complete their schooling.\u201d\nFor now, state education ministers say end-of-year exams will proceed. On Wednesday the Victorian education minister, James Merlino, said final-year students \u201cwill complete their studies\u201d.\n\u201cOur students and their families, teachers and principals are obviously concerned about what the impact of the coronavirus pandemic will be on students who are currently doing their VCE or VCAL,\u201d he said.\n\u201cOur year 11 and 12 students will receive the care and support they need during this important time in their schooling.\n\u201cWe are working on a range of options to ensure they supported to do that. This includes a greater focus on online learning, the delaying of deadlines for particular pieces of assessable work [and] the timing of exams, and looking at what other supports we can provide.\u201d\nOther state education authorities have already begun making changes to requirements for year 12 students.\nIn Queensland the education department announced on Wednesday that it had decided to drop one of the four assessments usually required for final-year students in each subject \u201cto provide some relief for students during this time, and support teachers manage reduced classroom time\u201d.\nNew South Wales announced last week that higher school certificate exams would go ahead but principals would be given more power over the number and weighting of assessments.\nSome universities have already begun taking steps to change the way they process admissions.\nOn Tuesday night the University of Western Australia \u2013 one of the Group of Eight which makes up Australia\u2019s most prestigious tertiary education providers \u2013 told potential students it was offering two new entrance pathways into its main undergraduate degrees.\nBeyond the normal Australian tertiary admission rank, UWA said it would also admit students on the basis of a predicted Atar calculated using a student\u2019s year 11 results as well as a special tertiary admissions test.\nWhile there are some limits on the degrees offered under the new admissions pathways, UWA said it had made the announcement early to \u201cput your minds at ease during this time of unprecedented uncertainty\u201d.\nUniversities Australia, the peak body for the tertiary sector, said all universities were developing \u201ccontingency plans\u201d in case there was widespread disruption to admissions.\n\u201cUniversities use a range of criteria as part of their admittance processes,\u201d said UA\u2019s chief executive, Catriona Jackson. \u201cThis unprecedented situation is changing so rapidly that the impacts on both universities and schools six, nine and 12 months from now just aren\u2019t possible to predict.\n\u201cHowever, universities are nonetheless aware of the potential impact of COVID-19 on school examinations and are developing contingency plans. These will be updated as circumstances change.\u201d\nSome education experts think decisions like the one made by UWA should be taken across the board.\nPeter Hutton, one of the conveners of the Future Schools Alliance, has written to state education ministers and started a petition calling for the Atar to be scrapped in 2020.\nHutton has long believed that the Atar system is inequitable and fails to properly measure student potential. As a former principal of the Templestowe College in Melbourne, he scrapped year groupings and formed an agreement with Swinburne University which allowed soon-to-graduate students to gain pre-acceptance without having an Atar and study a university subject in their final year of schooling.\nHe says the disruption caused by Covid-19 could be an opportunity to take the pressure off students to gain university admission.\n\u201cWhat I would like is for the ministers to come out and say to the kids, don\u2019t panic, we\u2019ll sort you out, you aren\u2019t going to miss out on university,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThere are huge mental health impacts to the current situation and its unfair to put kids through preparing for an exam period that\u2019s going to be called off. They should be saying every young person in 2020 who has the prerequisites \u2013 and they obviously do need some form of pass-fail prerequisites \u2013 can go to university.\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfair to grade kids given the level and of the disruption and the difference between the haves and have-nots in terms of technological capabilities at home.\u201d",

Later, when the CNN reporter also quoted Trump\u2019s past remarks, the president resorted to an old epithet: \u201cFake news.\u201d\nAmerica and the world have been transformed unimaginably by the coronavirus pandemic but Trump\u2019s war on the media has remained a constant and possibly even intensified. The intemperate outbursts might be interpreted as signs of a leader cracking under the pressure of his greatest crisis, for which his previous career offered no preparation.\nBut they are also striking in their echo of authoritarianism. While Trump has visibly delighted in fawning questions from the rightwing One America News Network, he has also implied that dissenting questions from other reporters signal disloyalty when the nation should be pulling together.\n\u201cBut just so you know, we\u2019re all \u2013 you, me, everybody \u2013 we\u2019re all on the same team,\u201d he told Alcindor on Sunday. A day later, when Alcindor asked why the US still lagged behind countries such as South Korea on testing per capita, he admonished: \u201cYou should be saying congratulations instead of asking a really snarky question.\u201d\nPresident Trump today at the White House said to me: \u201cBe nice. Don't be threatening.\u201dI\u2019m not the first human being, woman, black person or journalist to be told that while doing a job. My take: Be steady. Stay focused.  Remember your purpose. And, always press forward.\nThat alerted Maggie Haberman, White House correspondent of the New York Times, who commented on Twitter: \u201cHave never in 24 years in newspapers had anyone tell me reporters should be \u201ccelebrating\u201d or \u201capplauding\u201d someone until the last two years. It is how the president frames his view of coverage, and his supporters and allies have adopted that posture.\u201d\nRailing against the media has been a defining feature of Trump\u2019s political identity, a punchline at campaign rallies, deploying barbs such as \u201cthe enemy of the people\u201d. But when, after weeks of denial, he was finally forced to accept the scale of the coronavirus pandemic, he initially tried a more sombre and conciliatory tone.\nEven now he continues to offer an olive branch. \u201cI mean, even the media is much more fair,\u201d he said on Sunday, before quickly qualifying: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say all of it, but that\u2019s OK. They should be fair because they should want this to end. This is \u2013 this is about death.\u201d\nYet once tough questions start landing like arrows, the president reverts to type: belligerent, indignant, pugnacious, affronted by anyone with the temerity to dig up past statements or query his administration\u2019s failure to prepare.\nOn 20 March, Peter Alexander of NBC News asked a seemingly innocuous question: \u201cWhat do you say to Americans who are watching you right now who are scared?\u201d\nBut Trump lashed out: \u201cI say that you\u2019re a terrible reporter. That\u2019s what I say.\u201d\nThen Jon Karl, ABC News chief White House correspondent , pressed: \u201cAnd everybody who needs one will be able to get a ventilator?\u201d\nTrump retorted: \u201cLook, don\u2019t be a cutie pie. OK? \u2026 We had a bad testing system. We had a bad stockpile system. We had nothing in the stockpile system. So I wouldn\u2019t tell me what you\u2019re telling \u2013 you know, like being a wise guy.\u201d\nThen came Sunday\u2019s exchange with Alcindor, querying Trump\u2019s remarks on Fox News when he suggested that New York state was exaggerating how many ventilators it will need.\nTrump: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you act in a little more positive? It\u2019s always trying to \u2018get you, get you, get you\u2019. And you know what? That\u2019s why nobody trusts the media any more. That\u2019s why people \u2013\u201d\nAlcindor persisted: \u201cMy question to you is: How is that going to impact \u2013\u201d\nTrump barked: \u201cExcuse me. You didn\u2019t hear me. That\u2019s why you used to work for the Times and now you work for somebody else. Look, let me tell you something: be nice. Don\u2019t be threatening.\u201d\nIt was loaded language. Later, Alcindor tweeted: \u201cI\u2019m not the first human being, woman, black person or journalist to be told that while doing a job. My take: Be steady. Stay focused. Remember your purpose. And, always press forward.\u201d\nAnd it was not the first such incident. On 13 March, when Alcindor asked why Trump had scrapped the White House\u2019s national security council pandemic team two years earlier, he snapped: \u201cWell, I just think it\u2019s a nasty question.\u201d\nOn Monday, it was the turn of another thorn in Trump\u2019s side, Jim Acosta of CNN, to read back to him his past statements downplaying the threat of the virus and ask: \u201cWhat do you say to Americans who believe that you got this wrong?\u201d\nThe president predictably erupted. \u201cIt\u2019s why people just don\u2019t want to listen to CNN any more,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2026 Instead of asking a nasty, snarky question like that, you should ask a real question.\u201d\nThe briefings have been compared to rallies and make frustrating viewing. Some observers want the media to take a more combative approach. Chris Whipple, a writer, documentary maker and author of The Gatekeepers: How the White House Chiefs of Staff Define Every Presidency, said: \u201cGod bless Yamiche Alcindor but I think the rest of the press corps need to be more aggressive, not less aggressive.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re confronted with a bully, you have to punch back. The press corps need to be more aggressive in holding the president\u2019s feet to the fire or just stop showing up.\u201d\nWhipple added: \u201cThe president\u2019s coronavirus briefings have been a disgrace. He is a fountain of misinformation, partisanship and point scoring that is the last thing you need in a time of crisis, especially in a pandemic when there is a premium on truth.\u201d\nJoe Lockhart, a former White House press secretary, argues the briefings are aimed at two audiences, with the first part, when Trump reads general remarks, aimed at all Americans, and the second, in which he spars with reporters, aimed at his hardline supporters.\n\u201cIt appeals to his base because they are suspicious of the media and it undermines the people who are telling the story straight,\u201d he said. \u201cHis base love it when he\u2019s obnoxious and when he talks down to reporters. But the one place he\u2019s had trouble is when reporters read his own words back to him.\u201d\nLockhart, who hosts the Words Matter podcast and tweets a \u201cDaily White House Shadow briefing\u201d, added: \u201cTrump\u2019s entire strategy from day one has been to divide people. It\u2019s not a surprise that when everyone says he should help us to unify as a nation, he looks at it and says \u2018let\u2019s divide\u2019.\u201d",

        "content": "The humble eight-holed work boot has won over everyone from postal workers to punks, teens to today\u2019s celebrities and influencers. How did it stride to world dominance?\n\n  Tony Benn wore them. So did Agyness Deyn. Suggs loved them, also Kathleen Hanna and Joe Strummer. And Jordan Catalano. Hailey Baldwin, Rihanna and Bella Hadid still do. Once you start looking, Dr Martens are everywhere. Sixty years after launching the eight-hole 1460 boot \u2013 on, as the name suggests, the 1 April 1960 \u2013 it is an undisputed classic, one of those rare-as-hen\u2019s-teeth designs that is as likely to be spotted in a museum as it is (until recently, of course) on the streets outside. It is up there with Levi\u2019s 501s, the Fred Perry polo shirt, the Converse All Star and the Harrington jacket.\nAnd, like these other items, the 1460 is enjoying a fashion moment beyond its classic status. Perhaps because the past decade has been so turbulent \u2013 even before we had a global pandemic to contend with \u2013 fashion has returned to the dependable. The Hadids, Baldwin and Kaia Gerber are all endorsing Dr Martens. In other words, as Vogue declared in October, they have become \u201cmodel off-duty staple\u201d. While the vegan range and patterned designs have been credited with a 70% rise in profit for the brand in 2019, the 1460 remains the bestseller and it is this history that is likely to have attracted rumours in March of a potential \u00a3300m sale to a US private equity firm.\nDr Martens, and the 1460, began with a collaboration. If most modern alliances are between two brands (JW Anderson x Uniqlo, Adidas and Raf Simons), this one was a bit less hypebeast-friendly. A small shoe factory in Northamptonshire partnered with two doctors in Munich. Dr Klaus M\u00e4rtens had developed an air-cushioned chunky sole in 1947, after a foot operation following a skiing accident in 1945, and had begun making it with his friend Dr Herbert Funk to sell these comfortable shoes to older women. In Britain, the shoemaking Griggs family saw an ad for Martens\u2019 soles in 1959. After acquiring the licence, Bill Griggs designed the 1460, the eight-hole boot with the now familiar yellow stitching and chunky M\u00e4rtens sole, although when marketing the design for postwar Britain, the umlaut in Martens\u2019 name was removed at launch.\nInitially, the 1460s took the lead from M\u00e4rtens\u2019 designs, which were worn by those who prioritised comfort and durability. Marketed as a work boot and sold for about \u00a32 (roughly \u00a338 in today\u2019s money), postmen, factory workers and policemen wore them, and they became part of the uniform for London Underground workers. However, as with army jackets, jeans, even trench coats, the Dr Martens boot secured its place as a staple in our wardrobes after becoming a uniform for a series of subcultures. \u201cIt\u2019s almost easier to list which subcultures haven\u2019t adopted Dr Martens over the past six decades,\u201d says Andrew Groves, a professor of fashion design at the University of Westminster and the curator of Invisible Men, last year\u2019s exhibition about men\u2019s working wardrobes. \u201cThe list of those style tribes that took the DM to their hearts includes punks, skinheads, northern soulers, scooterists, as well as (later on) teenagers into grunge, two-tone, and Britpop.\u201d\nAs a symbol of working-class culture, it was the original skinheads \u2013 before the term equated to the far right \u2013 who first picked up on the 1460s. When the Who\u2019s Pete Townshend wore them on stage in 1967, he put them on the radar of the band\u2019s growing fanbase in the proto-skinhead scene. In his classic book Subculture: The Meaning of Style, Dick Hebdige sees the take-up of Dr Martens as the rejection of the explicitly aesthetics-based mod culture of the early 60s. Instead, this look was \u201caggressively proletarian, puritanical and chauvinist\u201d.\nGroves also points out the inherent rebellion of wearing something practical for its aesthetic value \u2013 even if that value is about fetishising working-class culture rather than just wanting to look sharp. \u201cAt their heart, all youth subcultures love nothing better than annoying their parents,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat better way to do that than adopting the boots your dad wears for his respectable job and subverting them into the latest youth craze?\u201d\nDuring the 70s and early 80s, the 1460s became part of a uniform worn with skinny bleached jeans, braces and, quite often, a bit of a snarl. Images of skinheads \u2013 either in Gavin Watson\u2019s classic photography book Skins, or Shane Meadows\u2019 This Is England trilogy \u2013 often feature DMs, and they continued to be associated with the subculture, even as, as Meadows documented, it became darker, as the far right infiltrated it.\nAlthough this association is still there, it\u2019s now a whisper \u2013 thanks to Groves\u2019 litany of other, less controversial, subcultures that also took up the DM. By the time i-D magazine\u2019s A Decade of i-Deas was published at the end of the 80s, the style magazine had declared them \u201cthe fashion accessory of the past five years\u201d. I remember blisters covering the back of my heels for weeks when I got my first pair in the 90s. Groves says he wore them \u201cwhen I was a mod, a skinhead and a casual \u2026 I\u2019ve worn them polished up with Sta-Prest trousers and scuffed-up with jeans. I\u2019ve probably got at least three or four pairs at the moment.\u201d\nThe breaking-in that the 1460 requires has now been a rite of passage for young people for more than 50 years. The current generation \u2013 who would have seen them worn by King\u2019s Road punks, kids in archive rave footage, Damon Albarn in the 90s, as part of queer culture from the 80s onwards, and emo in the 00s \u2013 have a whole archive of #inspo to explore. There\u2019s a democracy and an \u201ceveryboot\u201d quality to them that appeals \u2013 the Hadids might have a very different life from a 90s schoolgirl, but they, too, would have had to go through the blisters stage. Sophie Rhind, the senior footwear buyer at Asos, argues the democracy of the style is its strength. \u201cThe diversity of celebrities and influencers who are wearing DMs further hammers home the point that the brand can be worn by everyone and can be styled any which way possible,\u201d she says. On the site, it\u2019s the Jadon \u2013 a version of the 1460 with an uber-chunky sole \u2013 that is the most popular, with 20,000 pairs sold last year. Dr Martens is also producing a \u201cremastered\u201d series of 1460 collaborations this year \u2013 the Japanese brand A Bathing Ape and Raf Simons have featured so far.\nWhile tweaks to the boot are OK (camo print from Bape, ring decoration from Simons, the Jadon chunky sole), the recognisable design has to remain. In times of crisis such as we are experiencing now, perhaps putting on a boot that is tough, familiar, classic and (eventually) comfortable is what we need. While we won\u2019t be venturing far, they are the choice for your daily walk: Bella Hadid was photographed in Los Angeles this week on the way back from Target, wearing her DMs. \u201cThe Dr Marten is such an archetypal object that they can be worn in both an understated manner or used to underplay a full-on fashion look,\u201d says Groves. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine anything else being worn by your postie and Gigi Hadid, and both looking equally good in it.\u201d",

        "content": "Rate of infection in working class areas in and around Barcelona is nearly seven times higher than upmarket areas\nThe coronavirus pandemic in Spain is taking a disproportionate toll on the poor, the elderly, the marginalised and those working in low-paid but vital jobs, experts have warned.\nAn interactive map produced by the Catalan regional government showing the distribution of the virus reveals that residents of poor Barcelona neighbourhoods are six or seven times more likely to contract the virus than those in wealthy areas.\nWhile much of Spain has bounced back from the 2008 economic crisis, many parts of the country suffered deep, lingering cuts. The unemployment rate, which stands at 13.7%, is more than double the EU average, while youth unemployment is at 30.6%. About half the population has some difficulty making ends meet, and poverty is persistently higher for children, migrants, and Roma populations.\nAccording to the Catalan government figures, the rate of infection in working-class Roquetes is 533 per 100,000 inhabitants, while in upmarket Sant Gervasi it\u2019s only 77. Similarly high rates are found in the satellite towns of El Prat de Llobregat (604) and Badalona (597).\nDr Nani Vall-llosera, a GP in Bon Pastor, a low-income Barcelona neighbourhood, and former president of the Catalan primary care forum, points out that many of those deemed essential workers by the government work in low-status, poorly paid jobs where they have high exposure to the virus.\n\u201cPeople who work in shopping centres, supermarkets and old people\u2019s homes, as well as cleaners, are working without protection, often without masks,\u201d she said. \u201cThese people get infected, they go home and infect those around them because there\u2019s little possibility of self-isolating if you live in a small apartment.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cFurthermore, poverty and poor health are a vicious circle \u2013 the poorer you are the more likely you are to have health problems. And so the chances of becoming seriously ill with the virus are concentrated in poor neighbourhoods.\u201d\nLike many colleagues, Vall-llosera, is in no doubt that the ability of the health system to react has been \u201cdebilitated\u201d by years of spending cuts in public health, especially in Madrid and Catalonia, adding that \u201cthose parts of Spain where there have been least cuts are dealing with the virus better\u201d.\nThe doctor also warns of the distortion to the health system caused by the epidemic. \u201cWhile we focus all our resources on the coronavirus, which is probably what we have to do, it\u2019s also reducing our capacity to deal with other issues,\u201d she said.\nManuel Franco, a professor of epidemiology and public health at the University of Alcal\u00e1 in Madrid and the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health (USA), agrees that austerity measures \u2013 particularly around Madrid \u2013 have weakened the healthcare system.\nHe also says that inequalities in income, gender, education and country of origin are becoming increasingly apparent as the pandemic continues.\n\u201cIn many societies, care work \u2013 cleaning, looking after children and the elderly - is mostly carried out by foreign women,\u201d said Franco. \u201cA lot of them are not on the payroll so they have no rights when it comes to unemployment pay. They also probably live in the worst housing conditions in a city like Madrid.\u201d\nHe said that homeless people were also at risk and the NGOs and charities that helped them were forced to close.\n\u201cHow do these people get the minimum they need to survive? We don\u2019t have really good maps or ways to track these people and know what their living conditions are like,\u201d said Franco.\nAs Spain experiences its third week of lockdown, with all but essential workers ordered to remain at home, income disparities are becoming more apparent.\nPeople need to heat their homes as they stay away from work. But they also have to home-school their children, which usually means a computer, tablet or smartphone is needed for distance classes \u2013 as is a good internet connection.\nFranco said that while Spain\u2019s socialist-led coalition government was working to minimise the economic impact of the health crisis and protect the most vulnerable, basic structural inequalities were persisting and worsening.\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a will to protect those who will be hardest hit and to cover the gaps that are becoming wider and wider,\u201d he said.\n\u201cBut there are many small details of daily life and the social determinants of health are becoming more relevant: housing, income, education.\u201d\nFranco said the global epidemic, which has so far claimed 8,189 lives in Spain, called for action that went well beyond improving health systems.\n\u201cOf course healthcare workers are in a very tough situation, dealing with overstretched intensive care units but there are also people working in food stores, police officers, paramedics, firefighters \u2013 they\u2019re also suffering the same lack of equipment,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe never thought about that; we never thought that we could have such a big public health crisis \u2013 and mortality crisis in cities like Madrid, where the usual morgues can\u2019t cope with this situation. But I think that almost every decision that we have to take right now should be taken from the point of view of these social inequalities.\u201d\nA report published by Oxfam Intermon last year showed that, as well as a wide disparity of income, there is a difference of life expectancy of nearly 11 years between Barcelona\u2019s richest and poorest neighbourhoods, and seven years in Madrid.",

        "content": "Call comes as civil liberties advocate warns extended adjournment is \u2018unacceptable and dangerous for democracy\u2019\nThe shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, has called for parliament to continue to sit and scrutinise government emergency powers to deal with coronavirus, as concerns about unchecked executive power in Australia grow.\nThe call on Wednesday comes as the bipartisan delegated legislation committee resolved to establish an inquiry into non-disallowable instruments including new Covid-19 public health orders, citing research by the legal expert Andrew Edgar that they are putting federal government actions beyond the reach of parliament.\nThe New South Wales Council for Civil Liberties president, Nicholas Cowdery, has urged the commonwealth and NSW parliaments to resume before August and September, warning the current extended adjournments are \u201cunacceptable and dangerous for democracy\u201d.\nOn Wednesday Scott Morrison and Anthony Albanese agreed to a sitting day on 8 April to pass the third government Covid-19 support package.\nEarlier, Dreyfus called for an unabbreviated \u2013 but possibly remote \u2013 session of parliament to consider other business. Labor has also written to the Australian National Audit Office asking it to scrutinise the more than $200bn of government spending and more than $100bn in lending in the first two tranches of economic support.\nOn 18 March the governor general declared Covid-19 to be a \u201chuman biosecurity emergency\u201d, which enlivens very broad powers in the Biosecurity Act for the health minister to \u201cdetermine any requirement that he or she is satisfied is necessary\u201d to prevent entry or spread of a disease.\nThey are subject to safeguards that the requirement must be \u201clikely to be effective\u201d, is \u201cappropriate and adapted\u201d to its purpose and is \u201cno more restrictive or intrusive than is required in the circumstances\u201d.\nThe Labor senator Kim Carr, the deputy chair of the delegated legislation committee, has received advice that the powers could be used to order telcos to turn over metadata, including location data, to track whether citizens are abiding by physical distancing rules and conduct contact tracing.\nOn 23 March the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee endorsed the use of mobile phone data to enforce quarantine.\nEdgar noted on the Australian Public Law blog that as at 27 March the minister had made four non-disallowable determinations including to ban overseas travel by Australians and to use the Swissotel in Sydney for quarantine by declaring it to be a \u201chuman health response zone\u201d.\nEdgar noted their non-disallowable nature \u201cconflicts with regulation-making norms\u201d \u2013 that parliament can reverse executive actions that go beyond legislative authority \u2013 and the orders come with criminal penalties including imprisonment.\n\u201cThe check on the power that is relevant is that the determinations cease to apply at the end of the human biosecurity emergency period, which is three months.\u201d\nCarr told Guardian Australia he is \u201cconcerned that executive-made laws do give the appearance of decision-making by decree\u201d.\nCarr accepted they were \u201centirely justified for the defence of the community today\u201d but said they need to be explained by the government, including their duration, which he said cannot be \u201cindefinite\u201d.\n\u201cThis is not a question of disagreeing with the policy aim, it\u2019s about implementation, the arbitrary use of power by decree \u2013 there should be proper scrutiny of that.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want Australia to become like Hungary,\u201d he said, in reference to new laws using the coronavirus to create indefinite emergency powers. Carr also questioned the use of the military to conduct quarantine checks, which are then enforced by state law enforcement.\nThe delegated legislation committee, which is chaired by the Liberal senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells, resolved to write to ministers warning them that regulations must \u201cbe time limited where it trespasses on personal rights or liberties, or amends, or modifies the operation of, primary legislation\u201d and calling on the government to explain what safeguards are in place.\n\u201cParliamentary scrutiny of executive-made laws is essential in critical times like these,\u201d Fierravanti-Wells said.\n\u201cBy continuing to scrutinise legislative instruments which would ordinarily be subject to parliamentary oversight, the committee will play its part in ensuring that the government remains accountable to the parliament during this time.\u201d\nOn Wednesday, Dreyfus welcomed the government\u2019s decision to recall parliament to pass its $130bn third support package, which includes a new jobkeeper wage subsidy payment.\nOn Twitter, the shadow attorney general said Scott Morrison \u201cmust not shut [parliament] down again as soon as he gets what he needs\u201d.\nWhen the Parliament re-convenes, Mr Morrison must not shut it down again as soon as he gets what he needs \u2013 Parliament should continue to sit in some way, shape or form during the current crisis (e.g. with the assistance of technology or with fewer MPs attending in person) 2/5\n\u201cOver the coming months, the Morrison government will make decisions that will have extraordinary consequences for millions of Australians and for the social and economic fabric of our country for at least a generation,\u201d Dreyfus said.\n\u201cParliament has given the government emergency powers to respond to this crisis.\n\u201cEvery member of the parliament has a role in ensuring that those powers will be exercised in the best interests of their constituents and of our nation.\u201d\nParliament has given the Government emergency powers to respond to this crisis.

        "content": "Golden eagles are one of the most protected species in the US \u2013 so what happens when one turns up dead in a field?\nOne morning toward the end of January 2019, Steve Lewis, a US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) biologist in Juneau, Alaska, logged on to the website Movebank.org to check the whereabouts of some golden eagles that he had tagged with GPS trackers.\nLewis, a lanky, outdoorsy 49-year-old, usually tried to look at the location data once a week, but he had spent most of the month at home on furlough, unable to work as a result of the government shutdown. Eager to catch up with his birds, Lewis beelined it to his office when he got back to work. \u201cThe first thing I did,\u201d he says, \u201cwas go and check on my eagle tags.\u201d\nOne bird in particular, Golden Eagle 1703, gave him pause. Lewis knew the animal well. He had tagged it on 26 July 2017, when it was still a nestling on a rocky outcrop in Denali national park and preserve. Even before it knew how to fly, 1703 displayed its might by leaping from its nest and gliding a quarter mile down a valley to evade Lewis\u2019s initial attempt at tagging it. After a short hike, Lewis and his team retrieved the squawking bundle of black and white feathers, outfitted it with the tracking device, and returned it safely to its nest.\nIn the 18 months that followed, 1703 flourished. The bird traversed about 8,000 miles, from Denali to Wyoming, all the way back up to Alaska\u2019s North Slope, where it probably feasted on waterfowl and perhaps a straggling caribou calve of two. From there, it carved a long, treacherous path south through the wilderness of western Canada and worked its way back to the lower 48 to hunker down for its second winter on Earth.\nLittle is known about what golden eagles do in the liminal years between leaving their parents\u2019 nest and settling down to build a nest of their own. Each ping from 1703\u2019s solar-powered GPS revealed a tiny part of the picture, offering a rare glimpse of an apex predator as it learned the ropes of the natural world. \u201cIt takes four or five years for them to reach maturity,\u201d Lewis says, \u201cand it\u2019s unknown how long it actually takes them to then compete and get into the breeding population. So you have to follow a bird for years.\u201d\nBut now, staring at his computer screen on that January morning, Lewis could see that 1703\u2019s location device was stationary in Sully county, South Dakota, and had been so for two days. \u201cIt was seeing the sun and talking to the satellites,\u201d Lewis says, \u201cbut it wasn\u2019t moving.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for Lewis to lose a bird. Since 2014, he, along with colleagues from the National Park Service and the US Geological Survey, have tagged 49 golden eagles in Alaska as part of a broader effort to understand their biology, behavior and population trends. Of those birds, only 17 are still being monitored. Sometimes the GPS device malfunctions or the eagle shakes free from it. Other times the bird dies.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tough world out there,\u201d Lewis tells me, \u201cespecially for eagles.\u201d They can starve to death or get electrocuted by high wires or be decapitated by wind turbines. None of those fates, however, seemed likely in the rolling farmland of Sully county.\nHoping to get a sense of what went wrong, Lewis opened a souped-up version of Google Earth, plugged in the last GPS coordinates he had for 1703, and began looking around the virtual landscape. There was a nearby road, a line of trees, acres of empty land, and what looked to be a farmhouse. \u201cIt definitely felt suspicious,\u201d Lewis says.\nHe called up a Fish and Wildlife office in Pierre, South Dakota, and asked if anyone could go check on a downed eagle tag.\nRichard Bare wasn\u2019t sure whether to be pissed off or deeply disappointed by the prospect of having to retrieve yet another dead eagle. \u201cI first and foremost suspected a shooting because we were having a rash of eagle shootings,\u201d says Bare, a special agent with FWS\u2019s office of law enforcement, who was stationed in South Dakota at the time. In the five weeks leading up to 1703\u2019s death, he had responded to a bald eagle shooting and two separate golden eagle shootings. None of the birds survived, and he found no evidence to suggest the incidents were related. The case of 1703 seemed like more of the same.\nWhile the average American might be shocked to learn of an eagle being intentionally blasted from the sky, those who work in wildlife law enforcement know it\u2019s an alarmingly common problem. According to one FWS report, somewhere in the range of 1,000 golden eagles are shot each year. Sometimes it\u2019s poachers who want to sell the bird\u2019s feathers on the black market, other times it\u2019s ranchers who want to keep the dive-bombing predators from snatching their livestock.\nBare, who has been a special agent since 2016 and before that spent close to a decade in the field as an FWS game warden (the outdoor world\u2019s equivalent of a beat cop) ballparks that over the course of his career he\u2019s dealt with upwards of 200 cases involving eagles \u2013 shootings, poisonings, collisions with cars, starvations. \u201cIf you asked me about any other eagle, I probably wouldn\u2019t remember it,\u201d he says. But 1703 \u201cwas a flashbulb event\u201d because the weather was memorably miserable, even by South Dakota standards. A punishing cold snap had plunged temperatures well below zero while sustained winds of 50mph ripped across the plains.\nAfter a quick chat with Lewis, Bare loaded his cold-weather gear into his truck and hit the road. 1703\u2019s GPS tracker was pinging about five miles north-west of where the Oahe Dam cuts across the Missouri River to form Lake Oahe, one of the nation\u2019s largest man-made reservoirs and fertile hunting ground for birds of prey.\nWhen Bare arrived at the location, he saw all the same features that had popped up on Lewis\u2019s computer screen \u2013 the quiet country road, the shelter belt of trees and the farmhouse, which in real life was dilapidated and long ago abandoned. A firm layer of snow crunched under his boots as he walked across the field, scanning the ground for any signs of an eagle or an errant GPS tag. Then, among the knee-high wheat reeds that poked through the frozen landscape, Bare spotted what looked to be a clump of tail feathers. He took out his camera and began documenting everything. \u201cEven though something might not be a criminal investigation, I have to treat it as such and maintain the integrity of the evidence,\u201d he says, \u201cthe evidence being the eagle in this case.\u201d\nOnly two species of eagles are native to the US \u2013 the bald eagle and the golden eagle \u2013 and few animals in the world enjoy as many legal protections as they do. In addition to the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the Lacy Act, which regulates the trade of wildlife, they are privy to the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, a federal statute that threatens steep fines and jail time for anyone caught killing eagles, disrupting their nests, or generally interfering with the birds.\nPassed in 1940, the law was originally designed to protect only bald eagles. At the time, the species was teetering on the edge of extinction in the contiguous US as a result of hunting, habitat loss and the toxic effects of DDT. In 1962, Congress amended the act to include golden eagles. Nearly 50 years later, the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act has proven to be a godsend, at least for bald eagles. The national bird is widely considered one of the 20th century\u2019s greatest environmental comeback stories: in 1963, a mere 417 nesting pairs lived in the lower 48. Today well over 10,000 pairs can be found from the suburbs of Boston to garbage dumps near Seattle.\nGolden eagles haven\u2019t been as lucky. While they are not classified as an endangered or threatened species, they certainly aren\u2019t thriving. FWS estimates that in 1967, there were 31,813 golden eagles in the US. In 2014, the most recent year for which data is available, the agency estimated there were 31,477 golden eagles in our skies. It\u2019s a remarkable stretch of stability, but it\u2019s unclear if the numbers can hold as wind farms rise across the western US and myriad pressures from habitat loss, environmental degradation and the climate crisis push down on raptors and the animals they prey upon.\nWith so many threats looming, Bare knows as well as anyone that the last thing golden eagles need are people shooting them out of the sky. After a few minutes of photographing the area, he dug 1703\u2019s frozen carcass out from under the snow and gave it a once over in the wind-whipped field. Much to his surprise, there were no overt signs of trauma \u2013 no bloody bullet hole or broken wing or spilled guts. The bird weighed more than 7lb and, aside from being dead, looked to be in good shape. Still, there was no telling what type of damage might be lurking under its plumage. Bare zipped 1703 into a small body bag and chewed over the possibilities on his drive back to the office.\nA day or two later, a preliminary X-ray seemed to support his original hunch when it revealed two metal fragments near one of 1703\u2019s wings. \u201cIt resembled the approximate diameter of buckshot,\u201d Bare says. Following protocol, he packed 1703 on ice and FedExed it to the National Fish & Wildlife Forensics Laboratory in Ashland, Oregon.\nLike that, 1703 had gone from a high-flying predator to commercial cargo.\nOn any given day, a menagerie of dead animals passes through the FWS\u2019s forensics lab. From the outside, the building looks like most any other government facility \u2013 squat, gray, plenty of parking. Inside, it\u2019s filled with sophisticated laboratory equipment and staffed by a small, exquisitely specialized team of scientists whose disciplines range from herpetology to ornithology to ballistics to genetics. When it comes to analyzing evidence of animal-related crimes and building scientifically sound prosecutions against wildlife traffickers, poachers and others who inflict harm on nature\u2019s inhabitants, there is no better place on earth.\nLike any potential murder victim, 1703 underwent a full postmortem in hopes of pinpointing the cause of death. That task fell to Rebecca Kagan, one of two staff pathologists at the lab. If there\u2019s a federally protected animal that dies under mysterious circumstances, there\u2019s a decent chance it will end up on Kagan\u2019s exam table. One day it\u2019s an endangered Mexican gray wolf; the next day an eagle.\n\u201cWe get a lot of bald and golden eagles,\u201d Kagan laments. In 2019, she and the other pathologist at the lab necropsied about 100 eagles total, including 1703. Managing an endless stream of suspiciously dead animals can be bleak. But Kagan keeps a sharp sense of humor \u2013 she jokes that she always carves the bird at Thanksgiving \u2013 and finds comfort in knowing that her work is ultimately in service of conservation. Sometimes a necropsy yields evidence that helps finger the bad guy. Other times her efforts reveal that there wasn\u2019t any foul play, just the lethal hand of Mother Nature at work.\nKagan unpacked 1703 on 13 February 2019, roughly three weeks after Lewis first noticed its GPS at a standstill. Dribs of a red-brown fluid leaked from the bird\u2019s mouth when she tilted its carcass. She checked the esophagus and it was empty. She checked the crop, a pouch-like structure near the upper part of the digestive tract, and found a 3.5oz blob of partially masticated muscle and fat mixed with a few white hairs that looked like they came from a deer. \u201cThe nutritional condition was good,\u201d Kagan recalls. \u201cThis bird didn\u2019t starve to death.\u201d\nSlowly and methodically, she worked 1703 over, inspecting and documenting every inch of its insides and outsides. A large amount of \u201cwatery, red-tinged\u201d excrement pooled in its cloaca and its gall bladder contained \u201cscant, yellow-green, watery bile\u201d, according to the necropsy report.\nKagan eventually arrived at the two metal pellets that showed up on the preliminary X-ray only to discover that they were nothing more than tiny remnants from the GPS harness. Hours spent deconstructing 1703, and the cause of death wasn\u2019t any clearer. \u201cIt\u2019s a little frustrating,\u201d she tells me. \u201cWe really checked everything with this bird.\u201d\nAs a final step, she shipped 1703\u2019s liver to Michigan State University for a detailed toxicology analysis. A few weeks later the results came back positive for bromadiolone, better known as rat poison.\nEven if you\u2019ve never heard of bromadiolone or its chemical counterparts \u2013brodifacoum difenacoum and difethialone \u2013 chances are you\u2019ve been in close proximity to them. They are known as \u201csecond-generation anticoagulant rodenticides\u201d, a popular class of poisons that essentially kills a rodent by making it bleed to death from the inside out. Exterminators stuff these poisons in those black plastic bait boxes that you see everywhere in cities \u2013 down alleys, on the sides of restaurants, in condo buildings\u2019 parking lots \u2013 and they are deployed throughout the agricultural sector to keep germ-carrying rodents away from food supplies.\nThese poisons came to prominence in the late 1970s and early 1980s and were \u201cextremely widely embraced\u201d from the get-go, says Bobby Corrigan, an esteemed rodentologist who has spent his career studying and consulting on pest control practices. \u201cIt was kind of a magic bullet of advanced chemistry.\u201d\nCorrigan frequently preaches the importance of addressing the root causes of rodent infestations \u2013 improving trash storage and collection, addressing degrading infrastructure \u2013 and is unsettled by the widespread reliance on second-generation anticoagulants and lax enforcement efforts by the Environmental Protection Agency to restrict their use. But \u2013 and this is an important, he says \u2013 the sad truth is that we are dependent on these poisons. Forgoing them entirely would lead to an explosion in rodent populations that could usher in \u201ca public health catastrophe\u201d.\nOne reason these poisons are so effective is because, in most cases, the rat or ground squirrel or vole or whatever the target vermin happens to be only needs to eat a single dose. The poison works quickly, and the critter typically doesn\u2019t have time to excrete any of the poison before it keels over. In other words, a rat that dies from a second-generation anticoagulant often dies with a belly fully of poison. And if a scavenger comes along and plucks up the rodent corpse, it, too, will be exposed to the poison. It\u2019s a process that scientists call bioaccumulation, and it occurs all the way up the food chain.\nJust like mercury in the ocean, these rat poisons have seeped into ecosystems far and wide. A 2018 study from the California department of pesticide regulation found detectable levels of second-generation anticoagulants in roughly 85% of mountain lions, bobcats and Pacific fishers that were examined. Birds of prey, including eagles, are especially at risk for these types of \u201cnon-target animal\u201d exposures. Maureen Murray of the Cummings school of veterinary medicine at Tufts University analyzed 94 birds of prey from New England and found traces of these poisons in a stunning 96% of them. \u201cWe can say confidently that there\u2019s widespread exposure,\u201d Murray says. \u201cBut how that translates into mortality or deaths is still very much an unanswered question.\u201d\nThe toxicology report for 1703 showed that it had 0.05 parts per million of bromadiolone in its liver. Murray says it\u2019s unlikely that\u2019s enough to directly kill an eagle, but there\u2019s not really any good data on what the lethal threshold is for a bird of that size. If the poison didn\u2019t deal the fatal blow, I ask, could it have impaired 1703 in a way that made the bird less capable of hunting or migrating or withstanding the winter and thus contributing to its death? Again, Murray says, it\u2019s an important question to which there\u2019s no answer. And even worse, it\u2019s becoming an increasingly difficult question to study because, Murray explains, so many raptors in the wild now have rodenticide in them that it\u2019s almost impossible to find enough birds that are free of rat poison to serve as a control group.\nBecause of all the uncertainty around how the poisons affect birds, Kagan listed the final cause of death on 1703\u2019s necropsy report as \u201cundetermined (suspect poison)\u201d. It\u2019s a fate that many golden eagles suffer. While data is scarce, FWS scientists estimate that poisonings are now the leading cause of anthropogenic-induced death among golden eagles, possibly killing as many as 2,000 a year.\nKagan\u2019s exam table was the end of the line for 1703. Sometimes an eagle can be sent to the National Eagle Repository, which distributes deceased eagles to Native American tribes so they can use the animals for ceremonial purposes. 1703 would not find any such greater meaning in death, however, because the eagle repository, according to an FWS spokesperson, cannot distribute eagles exposed to rodenticides.\nOn 7 March 2019, Kagan filed the official necropsy report and moved on to the next animal carcass in her queue.\nWithout any evidence of a clearcut crime and an ever-expanding caseload, Bare closed the file on 1703 and retrained his focus on the spate of eagle shootings.\nAnd out in Juneau, Lewis logged 1703\u2019s data and carried on monitoring the 17 other golden eagles that are still tagged and up in the air, hoping they avoid the wind turbines and high-voltage wires and blasts of buckshot and poisoned prey that have made the natural world so unnaturally dangerous for the species.\n\u201cI know that death is a reality,\u201d Lewis says, \u201cbut it\u2019s really frustrating when it seems like it\u2019s a senseless death.\u201d\nThis article was amended on 10 April 2020 to correct the name of the National Eagle Repository.",

        "content": "Players in the big leagues make millions of dollars but it can be a financial struggle for players further down the ladder. And that was before Covid-19\nBy the end of January, John O\u2019Reilly was champing at the bit to get to spring training. Like most minor leaguers, the 24-year-old pitcher, newly assigned to the Pittsburgh Pirates organization, viewed baseball\u2019s preseason as a mecca of opportunity. Sure, O\u2019Reilly who played last season in Double-A, minor league baseball\u2019s second-highest level, wasn\u2019t expecting to make it to the majors and become the Pirates\u2019 opening day starter. But with a decent showing perhaps he could inch his way up minor league baseball\u2019s arduous, low-salaried ladder.\nAnd, when it started, O\u2019Reilly was having what he considered to be a highly successful spring training. He had been called upon to finish innings for major league pitchers. In one game, he pitched against the New York Yankees, a big deal for a kid from New Jersey.\nThen on the evening of 13 March O\u2019Reilly got a message from the organization. Beginning tomorrow morning everyone must go home. By that point the Covid-19 outbreak had been officially declared a pandemic. It was no longer safe for any large groups to gather together. Baseball games were no exception.\n\u201cIt is definitely scary,\u201d O\u2019Reilly says. \u201cLess of a chance to go out and play the game you love with your teammates. You look forward to it for the five months you\u2019re away [during the offseason].\u201d\nO\u2019Reilly went home to his family in New Jersey where he is anxiously following the news. With no gyms open, nowhere suitable to throw, and unlike Major Leaguers, no guarantees of being paid this season.\nMitch Horacek, a 28-year-old pitcher in the Minnesota Twins organization opted to stay in Florida with his girlfriend\u2019s family instead of going home to the cold of Colorado. One day Twins doctors were cautioning players to wash their hands and avoid signing autographs. Three days later, Horacek\u2019s big league hopes were paused. Horacek had been following Covid-19\u2019s growth since the first outbreak in Wuhan, China, and sensed baseball could be shelved a while.\n\u201cOne of our last games had almost 10,000 people,\u201d Horacek says. \u201cIt was a culmination of my nerves. I kept thinking someone here might have this virus, we should do something. Of course things got way more crazy.\u201d\nThe exodus from camps was chaotic and unprecedented. As teams were figuring out how to operate in the new climate, Horacek, O\u2019Reilly and hundreds of other minor leaguers started to worry about when \u2013 or if \u2013 they would be paid.\nThen again, money is always a concern in the minor leagues. Players are provided housing and a $10 per diem during spring training. They get no salary. During the regular season, players make anywhere from a measly $1,160 a month to a slightly less measly $2,100 a month, depending on which level they play at.\nDespite being professional athletes, these players\u2019 salaries often fall below the United States\u2019 minimum wage, forcing many to get creative to make ends meet. Horacek says it\u2019s commonplace for players to double the occupants allowed on a lease so they can all afford to pay rent. Many offer pitching or hitting lessons, but a huge chunk of players take second jobs that they can fit around their baseball career, such as delivery driving. Horacek used to engage in another common cost-cutter for minor leaguers: skipping breakfast.\nMinor leaguers understand it\u2019s all part of the sacrifice, namely because they have no other choice if they eventually want to make it to the big leagues. \u201cI watch guys I\u2019ve pitched well against. There are guys on TV I\u2019ve struck out before so I know I\u2019m good enough,\u201d Horacek says.\nLast season was Horacek\u2019s best training camp and, had a few more stars aligned, he says he could have been called up to the big leagues. Instead he toggled between Double-A and Triple-A, his dream dangling so close. Horacek\u2019s taxable income from baseball for 2019 was less than $8,000.\nMinor leaguers\u2019 low salaries have been discussed frequently over the past few years, most notably in 2018 when Major League Baseball lobbied Congress to exempt minor leaguers from making minimum wage. More recently, MLB floated the idea of contracting 42 minor league clubs at the end of the 2020 season. Bernie Sanders, currently competing to become the Democratic presidential candidate, has been a vocal opponent, calling the possible contraction another example of \u201ccorporate greed.\u201d Sanders, along with over 100 members of Congress, created the Save Minor League Baseball task force in November which has pushed back on MLB\u2019s plans for contraction and continued low salaries.\nAfter the start of the baseball season was postponed due to the coronavirus outbreak, MLB agreed to pay minor leaguers a spring training stipend of $400 a week. The league has since announced that minor leaguers will continue to receive the weekly stipend, plus health benefits, until the end of May. Ironically that\u2019s more than many minor leaguers receive when not in the midst of a global pandemic.\nHoracek was met with plenty of pushback on Twitter when he initially expressed his concern about pay. \u201cIt\u2019s a perception problem,\u201d he says. \u201cSomeone might perceive baseball as less of a job than working at a stadium concession job. Just because my job is fun doesn\u2019t make it easy and it doesn\u2019t make my bills go away.\n\u201cOne guy said there are plenty of people who would like to have my job in a second but while somebody might want to take my job, they can\u2019t. They physically can\u2019t.\u201d\nBack in February, MLB, largely at the behest of Sanders and the congressional task force, announced that it would boost pay for minor leaguers, starting with the 2021 season. Salaries are then expected to range from $1,600 a month for rookies up to $2,800 a month at the highest level, Triple-A.\nBut for many, that\u2019s not nearly enough. Enter Advocates for Minor Leaguers, a new group founded by a group of former players that is seeking annual minimum salaries of $15,000 for minor leaguers. Ty Kelly, a utility player who spent most of his 11-season career in the minors, says the organization was prepping to launch before the coronavirus halted spring training but it is prioritizing taking care of players left in limbo.\n\u201cI used to find an apartment for five months in the offseason. Then find a new lease for the next offseason,\u201d Kelly says. \u201cThere are tons of guys in that situation that don\u2019t have a home to go back to. It was necessary for us to launch now and try to help them.\u201d\nAdvocates for Minor Leaguers has already had a rush of donations, which Kelly attributes to the public\u2019s connection to minor league baseball and a growing understanding of the players\u2019 plights.\nKelly is one of the lucky minor leaguers who had his dream realized. After seven-plus years in the minors, making a salary below the poverty line, the New York Mets called him up and his life instantly changed. \u201cIt was crazy. I was called up from Colorado Springs, my least favorite AAA field by far, went straight to Washington DC to play with the Mets in this pristine park,\u201d he says.\nKelly was signed to a 25-man major league contract, where he was paid a prorated salary based on the MLB\u2019s minimum (currently $550,000 a year). He suddenly had protections. He had a union. The Mets team hotel was a Ritz Carlton where Kelly ordered a $20 omelette and coffee with no guilt.\nEven when Kelly, or any player, is sent back to the minors, they still earn a prorated salary base of $91,000 for the rest of the season. Even though Kelly was better off financially, it was somewhat jarring at first to return to the conditions and second-class citizenry of minor league baseball. These cultural differences are felt everywhere, from salary to resources to facilities.\nFor example, the Mets recently spent $57m to upgrade their spring training facility in Port St Lucie, including a pristine new clubhouse. But according to MLB.com\u2019s Anthony DiComo the minor league St Lucie Mets would have to remain in their basic clubhouse when spring training ended as a reminder of what they\u2019re trying to achieve.\nDespite the conditions, despite the unlivable wages, despite the slim odds of making it to the majors, the dangling carrot is too hard to walk away from for guys like Horacek.\n\u201cEvery year you play is like rolling craps,\u201d he says. \u201cSay you need to roll a seven. If you stop rolling the dice, you have no chance.\u201d",

        "content": "The National Theatre\u2019s smash-hit comedy starring James Corden is available free online until 9 April. Its director reflects on a runaway success\nOne Man, Two Guvnors is based on Carlo Goldoni\u2019s The Servant of Two Masters. You played the title role yourself at school \u2026 I wasn\u2019t very good! Compared with James Corden, I really wasn\u2019t very good.\nThe play was specifically created for James Corden, wasn\u2019t it? We had a serious, high-minded season planned for summer 2011 at the National Theatre. We needed something that was purely entertaining. In one of our regular meetings we were knocking around ideas and I think I said James should come back. Sebastian Born [from the literary department] said what about Servant of Two Masters? It immediately resonated but I wasn\u2019t interested in a commedia dell\u2019arte production with James in harlequin gear.\nI\u2019d just worked with Richard Bean on Dion Boucicault\u2019s London Assurance, which he had secretly punched up in a big way \u2013 a lot of the best jokes in it were his. So I called him and asked him to do this. I said to think of Ealing comedy, Carry On films, Brighton in the 1950s, end of the pier, variety \u2026 The relationship of Venice to Turin [in Goldoni\u2019s play] is essentially the same as Brighton to London. Venice is for the dirty weekend, the carnival \u2013 it\u2019s where the wicked stuff goes on. All of that fell into place really quickly and Richard identified the early 60s for the era. James was in immediately. He was one of a large number of people who, if you\u2019re running a big theatre like the National, you\u2019re always anxious to bring back. I knew how funny and skilled he is on stage.\nWould it have surprised you if you\u2019d been told at the time that he would one day host an enormous chatshow in the US? Not at all. And it came about because Les Moonves [former CBS executive] came to see One Man, Two Guvnors on Broadway.\nHow do you engineer this kind of stage farce? A lot of the physical and verbal humour go together. There\u2019s a sequence where James beats himself up as he\u2019s having an argument with himself. That started on the page \u2013 Richard had written that speech \u2013 and then James and [physical comedy director] Cal McCrystal worked out the physicality of that speech together. Cal, with his company Spymonkey, has been making this kind of comedy for a long time. It wouldn\u2019t be unfair to say he\u2019s like an accountant. The comedy has the precision of double-entry accounting. In rehearsals, Cal won\u2019t ever laugh. He is so deadpan. I remember him saying to Richard: \u201cThere\u2019s too many words here, it\u2019s like Ibsen.\u201d\nThe NT Live version that is being streamed by the National this week is longer than the play was when it got to the West End and Broadway. When it was on at the National, it was quite long. We had a two-and-a-half-hour show in rehearsal but the laughter added half an hour. We gradually had to cut it back.\nWhich moments of audience participation in the production stood out for you? Unfortunately, I wasn\u2019t there for the Trump episode. James had a good eye for who to bring up on stage to help him in the scene with the trunk. I think he recognised Donald Trump from The Apprentice. Trump, from the way James tells it, couldn\u2019t have been happier to be dragged up on to the stage. James bantered with him, and the audience enjoyed it and rolled their eyes. That was Donald Trump when he was a relatively harmless blowhard.\nThe first five minutes of One Man, Two Guvnors seem quite deliberately as if you\u2019re in Carry On-land. What I remember most vividly is those first minutes in the first preview, feeling the audience\u2019s jaws on the floor, as if they were asking: how can they be doing this? The moment they got it is in when James comes in, throws a peanut in the air and does a kind of dazzling thing that he and Cal worked out \u2013 falling backwards over a chair, catching the peanut in his mouth and springing straight back up again. There was a kind of collective decision in the audience: Oh, it\u2019s this kind of show!\nI\u2019ve never been involved in a show that harvested as many big laughs as regularly. There\u2019s no single individual that you can credit for that \u2013 it was a collective alchemy. I couldn\u2019t have done it without Cal or without Richard\u2019s extraordinary gift for individual jokes and building a whole comic sequence. A lot of people came to the National not knowing who James was. A lot of people were sceptical about James. But he is incredibly sympathetic and lovable. Above all, he is unbelievably skilled. I hope he\u2019ll come back one day \u2013 and I think he does, too.\nOne Man, Two Guvnors is streaming on YouTube from 7pm BST on Thursday 2 April. Available until 9 April.",

        "content": "A summary of the major developments in the coronavirus outbreak across Australia\nGood evening, and welcome to our daily roundup of the latest developments on the coronavirus pandemic in Australia. This is Melissa Davey bringing you the main stories on Wednesday 1 April.\nWestern New South Wales local health district said a person admitted to Orange base hospital with Covid-19 died on Wednesday after suffering complications due to the virus.\nAt the request of the family, a district spokeswoman said no further details would be provided. It takes the NSW death toll to 10 and the national toll to 21. Earlier on Wednesday, NSW Health announced that a 95-year-old woman who was a resident at the Dorothy Henderson lodge died overnight. The woman is the fifth person to die from coronavirus in the home. There are 4,860 cases in Australia.\nMore than 40,000 doctors, nurses, midwives and pharmacists who are no longer practising or registered will be encouraged to re-enter the workforce to boost capacity to treat patients throughout the pandemic.\nThe Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency on Friday said a short-term pandemic response sub-register would be in effect for the next year. This will be a separate and temporary register to the existing register of medical practitioners.\nOnly those who are properly qualified and competent will be invited to register, so practitioners who lost their registration due to malpractice will not be included. While it will be an opt-out register, no practitioner will be forced to practise and can remove themselves for any reason.\nOn Wednesday morning Victoria\u2019s police minister, Lisa Neville, and the premier, Daniel Andrews, both said partners who lived separately would not be allowed to visit each other under the state\u2019s interpretation of the new restrictions on movement. But by the afternoon the chief health officer, Brett Sutton, reversed the ruling, saying Victoria had \u201cno desire to penalise individuals who are staying with or meeting their partners if they don\u2019t usually reside together\u201d. Neville subsequently said the initial ban was Sutton\u2019s idea but the change in tack made a mockery of the premier\u2019s insistence that to comply with the new rules Victorians just needed to use \u201ccommon sense\u201d.\nQueensland will toughen its border shutdown laws from Friday, barring all non-residents from entering the state unless they have been granted an exception. Under the previous rules, people could cross the border provided they self-isolated for 14 days afterwards. But the police minister, Mark Ryan, said on Wednesday that the rules were set to change further.\n\u201cAnyone who is not a Queensland resident or considered exempt from the restrictions will not be able to enter Queensland from 12.01am Friday, April 3, 2020,\u201d Ryan said in a statement reported by the Courier-Mail.\nThe home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, said the government has amended the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations Act 1958 to stop exploitative exports of essential goods. This took effect on Tuesday.\n\u201cThe minister for health has now made a determination under the Biosecurity Act 2015 to enable the Australian Border Force to require that goods already in their custody be surrendered for provision to the National Medical Stockpile, or destruction if the goods are defective,\u201d Dutton said.\nThe minister said the changes meant people who have purchased essential goods at retail can not on-sell them at extortionate price, which is set at 120% of the price for which they were purchased.\nPeople who flout these laws would also be forced to \u201csurrender the essential goods to the Australian Federal Police for provision to the National Medical Stockpile, or destruction if the goods are defective\u201d, Dutton said.\nOn Monday the deputy chief medical officer, Prof Paul Kelly, said he would push the national cabinet to unlock modelling on how many Covid-19 cases may be expected in Australia, acknowledging that transparency is essential. New Zealand released a clearer picture of its modelling on Tuesday and there has been pressure on the government by some researchers and health workers to do the same.\nBut Kelly clarified his position on Wednesday, saying while \u201ctransparency can be a very important thing\u201d, modelling could be easily misinterpreted.\n\u201cWe need to make sure that it\u2019s presented in a way that is useful,\u201d he said. \u201cThe other thing I would say about modelling, and modellers themselves would also say this, modelling is not necessarily the truth. It is a way of seeing the world and potentially pointing out how one can influence certain scenarios. But if we knew the truth and could see exactly what was going to happen in the next few months exactly, then we don\u2019t need to model.\u201d\nGuardian Australia has previously written about why calling for the modelling on Covid-19 is not necessarily a straightforward ask.\nSix of Australia\u2019s leading international aid agencies urged the federal government to include specific measures to help charities continue their lifesaving work in Covid-19 support packages.\nThe organisations \u2013 Care Australia, ChildFund Australia, Oxfam Australia, Plan International Australia, Save the Children Australia and World Vision Australia \u2013 said the not-for-profit sector was facing a perfect storm of falling revenue and unprecedented demand for their services fuelled by the pandemic.\nEleven baggage handlers at Adelaide airport have tested positive, with two further cases among family members, taking the cluster of cases associated with the Qantas staff to 13. More than 100 other people related to the cluster, either fellow workers or close contacts, are also in self-isolation.\nSouth Australia\u2019s deputy chief public health officer, Michael Cusack, said the outbreak had prompted a change in testing criteria. Anyone who had visited the airport in the past 14 days and who had since developed symptoms was now advised to get tested and self-isolate. But Cusack said health officials had not recommended closing the airport completely \u2013 AAP\nScott Morrison has offered a prayer for the national cabinet to stay \u201cstrong and united\u201d as it responds to Covid-19. On 23 March Morrison called for Australians of faith to pray as parliament reconvened to pass the second tranche of fiscal support.\nAustralia\u2019s coronavirus lockdown rules explained: can I still visit my partner and other questions\nFull Story podcast: when is it legal to leave your home?\nIs Australia flattening the coronavirus curve?

I don\u2019t remember too much of the appointment after that. I switched off and went numb. Luckily, I had the physio from the club with me and he took all of the information in because I sat back in my chair staring out of the window thinking: \u2018How long have I got?\u2019\u201d\nSuddenly football was immaterial but, after being given the all-clear in December, MacDonald slowly navigated a route back to the pitch and last month, two operations and 556 days from his previous appearance in a Hull City shirt, he played an hour for the under-23s after weeks of building up fitness at home and at training.\n\u201cTo actually be in a little stadium playing against a team I didn\u2019t know, that was the real \u2018Shit, I\u2019m back, I\u2019ve made it\u2019 kind of thing. I think the last time I felt that good was when I was 15, getting a call-up to play for the reserves at Reading. To come back in and be involved with the music on \u2026 I was like: \u2018Where\u2019s my shin pads, where\u2019s my boots, where\u2019s everything at?\u2019 It was such a feel-good moment.\u201d\nBut, in terms of raw emotion, it is difficult to top the outpouring of relief that followed his positive news before Christmas. His diagnosis last summer compounded a trying couple of years, with MacDonald, who also suffered from colitis, missing almost all of last season with deep vein thrombosis after a blood clot in his right calf. Then came the biopsies and colonoscopies, one of which led to the doctor calling MacDonald back to the hospital as a matter of urgency.\nIt has been a mental slog but the 27-year-old is hugely grateful for the support of his parents, Jane and Rob, his three sisters, Sophie, Emma and Rebecca, and his partner, the pop star Alexandra Burke.\nBefore an operation to remove his large bowel, which left him with a colostomy bag for nine weeks, Hull afforded MacDonald some headspace, allowing him to have a break in Dubai and then Japan, where Burke was starring in the musical The Bodyguard.\n\u201cI ended up learning all the words, all the dance moves,\u201d he says, laughing. \u201cI supported her on tour and she supported me and what I was going through. To be able to have some time off during that period was great, to get away from it and switch off from the fact I had bowel cancer and I was going to go through two major operations.\u201d\nHe did not want to tell his family, let alone the world \u2013 \u201cI didn\u2019t want to upset anyone or have anyone worrying about me\u201d \u2013 but once news of his diagnosis filtered through to the footballing fraternity, the former Barnsley and Torquay defender found himself overwhelmed by a deluge of messages. \u201cI had to turn my phone off because it kept freezing,\u201d he says, laughing.\nBefore Hull played Wigan in September, their players warmed up in shirts bearing MacDonald\u2019s name and number \u2013 \u201cI was in bed high on morphine but I checked my phone and it brought a tear to my eye\u201d \u2013 while the support of Joe Thompson, the former Rochdale midfielder who twice overcame Hodgkin lymphoma, was particularly pertinent and helped to provide crumbs of comfort at a dark time. \u201cHe reached out straight away and we kept in touch. He was great and I cannot thank him enough. I\u2019ve probably made a friend for life in Joe.\u201d\nMacDonald had been counting down the days to a first-team return before English football shut down owing to the coronavirus pandemic but he acknowledges such targets pale into insignificance at times such as these. \u201cFootball needs to take a backseat because people are losing their lives over this virus \u2013 that is more important than trying to finish the season. Every day is a blessing. You cannot take things for granted. If things get you down or you have a bad day, I don\u2019t sit and dwell on it like I used to. If I\u2019m not involved in the team or things like that, I just get on with it and know that there\u2019s going to be better days ahead.\n\u201cEverything has made me a lot stronger mentally. I had an inkling I was going to be involved against Charlton [on 14 March, when a postponed league game was originally scheduled] and then \u2018boom\u2019 everything has stopped again. It has been one thing after the other but you have to stay positive. This isn\u2019t going to last for ever and I\u2019m making sure I\u2019m ready to perform and fitter than ever.\u201d\nHe is speaking after a morning run in London \u2013 Hull\u2019s players continue to train in isolation \u2013 but when that moment eventually arrives MacDonald knows emotion is likely to get the better of him. \u201cI think I\u2019ll probably cry. I didn\u2019t know if I\u2019d ever make a comeback and to finally step back on the pitch in a Championship game would really make everything come together.\n\u201cDoctors said there were lots of possibilities but no guarantees the operations were going to be as successful as they were so everything was up in the air. I\u2019ve been through so much but hopefully stepping back on that pitch would put it all to bed and show people what I\u2019m made of. I\u2019m just hoping it won\u2019t be in front of no fans\u2026\u201d",

New social distancing guidelines have led many Americans to question whether it\u2019s safe to touch the same basket at the supermarket as other shoppers, let alone whom it is safe to sleep with. For those who are polyamorous, meaning having intimate relationships with more than one partner, it has meant renegotiating fundamental aspects of their dating lives.\nOn 27 March, the New York City department of health and mental hygiene issued guidelines surrounding safe sex, advising New Yorkers not to have sex with anyone outside of their immediate households and to take a break from in-person dates. Coronavirus is highly contagious and spread by droplets of saliva or mucus, making contact with others risky.\nFor people who consider themselves part of the poly community, that has meant making difficult decisions surrounding sexual monogamy and cohabitation, said Daniel Saynt, founder and head of New York City sex club New Society for Wellness (NSFW).\n\u201cIt\u2019s a terrifying time for non-monogamy,\u201d Saynt said. \u201cThere has been a stronger consideration recently for coupling off. It\u2019s kind of like cuffing season, but for corona season.\u201d\nAlthough just 5% of people in the US identify as polyamorous, up to 20% have attempted some form of consensual non-monogamy in their lifetimes, a 2017 study published in the Journal of Sex & Marital Therapy found.\nCat, a polyamorous woman living in New York City who asked her last name be withheld to protect her privacy, has spent the last 14 days in self-imposed quarantine with her roommate, who had been exposed to the virus. After she leaves the quarantine, she\u2019ll have to decide which of her two partners to see \u2013 and if it is ethical to do so. Ultimately, she said, she is leaning towards quarantining alone to avoid hurting either partner.\n\u201cCoronavirus is making everyone polyamorous, in a sense,\u201d she said. \u201cWe all have to navigate disclosure, safety, and health in similar ways.\u201d\nBeing holed up at home with one partner does not necessarily mean strict monogamy, said Saynt the NSFW founder. A lot of non-monogamous couples are still seeking to interact in a virtual way, and a rise in online events is making it more accessible.\n\u201cIn a way, this is also creating a new safety net for people who were curious about non-monogamy but were afraid of that initial intimacy point,\u201d Saynt said.\nNSFW has started to coordinate online parties for couples to engage in non-monogamy from a safe distance. Its first online \u201cplaydate\u201d attracted nearly 100 people who met one another through group video chats and could pair off for private sessions. Like NSFW\u2019s in-person parties, the event had a dress code and a set of rules stressing consent and privacy. The group used the video streaming app GetVokl for the event.\nNew York City artist Olivia Jane has been dating their partner for seven years, and during the last two they have introduced other people into their coupling. After learning about social distancing orders, Jane and their partner cut ties with a woman they were both dating when she fled the New York City area to quarantine in a remote cabin.\nMeanwhile, Jane said they have all but stopped using dating apps like Tinder and Feeld for the foreseeable future. \u201cWe are maintaining chats and sending nudes to people we were previously intimate with, but our schedule has really cleared up,\u201d Jane said.\nTheir relationship with another couple who lives in Philadelphia has gone purely digital for now, but Jane said they are considering moving in together to create a quad relationship as they potentially face eviction during the pandemic.\n\u201cWe are comfortable being monogamous, but we prefer not to be,\u201d Jane said. \u201cWe are being forced back into it. But out of all the people I have to be stuck with, my primary partner is the one I would want to quarantine with forever.\u201d",

They [airlines] are worried about survival and will need lots of support, lots of liquidity \u2013 that gives them a big responsibility.\u201d\nA group of 26 civil society groups in the UK have written to the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, demanding \u201cstringent conditions\u201d on any rescue, including strict targets on greenhouse gases in line with the Paris agreement and measures to help workers. \u201cPublic money must be used to address social and environmental priorities, as well as economic needs,\u201d they wrote.\nAviation has all but ceased in some countries and flights are vastly down in most others, owing to the lockdowns and other suppression measures. Airlines have been appealing to governments for bailouts as fleets have been grounded.\nBut campaigners and experts fear that after the Covid-19 outbreak has waned, the sector could bounce back with the aid of public money and send emissions soaring.\nIn their letter to the chancellor, the campaigners \u2013 including Greenpeace, Flight Free, the IPPR and New Economics Foundation thinktanks, and Tax Justice \u2013 call for the government to take equity stakes in airlines rather than handing out cash or loans. They want to see social benefits with workers\u2019 rights enforced, including a living wage and no mass redundancies a condition of any rescue. In the longer term, they want to see support for a \u201cjust transition\u201d for workers to move to jobs in lower carbon industries.\nThey also want a new fiscal regime that includes a frequent flyer levy or air miles levy, replacing air passenger duty, which would reduce demand without removing access to flights from those with limited alternatives or limited resources, by shifting the tax burden to frequent leisure flyers. About half of people in the UK do not fly in any given year, but 1% of people take a fifth of all flights.\nRebecca Newsom, head of political affairs at Greenpeace UK, said: \u201cEmergency funding must be used to tackle emergencies, not to support business as usual. Conditions are needed to protect workers\u2019 rights, prevent public money from being diverted into the pockets of shareholders, and reduce demand gradually over time through a frequent flier levy, so that the sector operates within safe limits for the climate.\u201d\nAttaching conditions to any bailout could take several forms. Ca\u00f1ete wants to see a carbon tax or emissions trading system such as the one operating under the EU. \u201cMarket mechanisms are needed,\u201d he said.\nAirlines UK, a trade body, said the industry was already taking steps to reduce their environmental impact before the coronavirus crisis hit. \u201cThe UK aviation sector has already committed to achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050 \u2013 the only national aviation industry to do so,\u201d said a spokesperson. \u201cThis will be achieved via a range of measures, including airspace modernisation, the development and commercialisation of sustainable aviation fuels, new cleaner planes, and the UN carbon offsetting scheme Corsia.\u201d\nAirlines face difficult choices ahead. More efficient aircraft will help to reduce emissions, but the impact will be limited. Biofuels offer a possible answer, but they are still expensive and there are difficulties in ensuring that the sources are environmentally sustainable. Electric planes are still some way in the future, and solar-powered flight a distant dream.\n\u201cWe need to stimulate research and development into things like hydrogen fuel,\u201d said Barbara Buchner, managing director of the Climate Policy Initiative. \u201cWe need more proactive thinking from airlines \u2013 they can\u2019t imagine we will go back to the way they were before.\u201d\nThe coronavirus disruption may also bring about permanent changes in people\u2019s habits, some experts hope. Business flying has stopped meetings from happening, but people have found ways to work with video conferencing and other cheap technology, forcing businesses to question whether their staff need to fly as much in future.\nThese eight companies\nThese eight companies are among those who will help you offset your carbon emissions. Here is an indication of the cost, and where the money will be spent:\nClimate CareCost: \u00a317.61 for 2.35 tonnesProjects: Safe drinking water in Malawi, fuel efficiency in Ghana, landfill energy in Thailand, rainforests in Brazil\nAtmosfairCost: \u00a3106 for 5 tonnesProjects: Energy efficiency in South Africa, biogas in Nepal, wind and hydro power\nCarbonfund.orgCost: $47 for 2.24 tonnesProjects: Water treatment in Kenya, hydroelectric in India\nClevelCost: \u00a338.74 for 2.6 tonnesProjects: Restoring grasslands in Mongolia, reducing deforestation in Tanzania\nFlygreenCost: \u00a320.79 for 2.4 tonnesProjects: Solar panels in India\nMyclimateCost: \u00a372 for 3.1 tonnesProjects: Energy efficiency in Africa, reforestation in Nicaragua\nCarbonfootprint.comCost: Between \u00a37 and \u00a330 a tonneProjects: Borehole rehabilitation in Uganda, hydroelectric in Chile\nGold StandardCost: Asks you to calculate your own emissions and choose a projectProjects: Water purifiers in Cambodia, fuel-efficient stoves in Sudan\n\u201cWe are not flying as much \u2013 why not keep not flying?\u201d asked Kevin Anderson, professor of energy and climate change at Manchester University. \u201cWhy not reinforce the good things that are coming out of Covid-19?\u201d\nOne effect of the coronavirus crisis has yet to be felt. Under the Corsia (Carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation) system adopted by the International Civil Aviation Organisation, airlines would have to curb their future emissions using efficiencies, alternative fuels and offsetting, such as investing in forests, renewable energy or other carbon-cutting projects.\nBefore the coronavirus crisis emerged, airlines pushed for the average emissions in the years 2019 and 2020 to be used as the baseline by which future emissions would be judged. In any years from 2021 onwards, when emissions from the sector exceed the average of 2019 and 2020, the difference between actual emissions and the baseline will have to be offset, meaning airlines will have to buy carbon credits from carbon-cutting projects.\nChoosing 2019 and 2020 should have made those targets easy to meet for airlines if air travel had continued to rise this year as it has in recent years. With the Covid-19 pandemic, however, the disruption to travel means emissions are likely to be drastically lower than envisaged for 2020 \u2013 meaning Corsia\u2019s future carbon targets will be much tougher for them to reach, if the scheme goes ahead without changes.",

A study showed almost 60% of Brazilians are staying at home.\nJo\u00e3o Doria, the governor of Brazil\u2019s most populous and economically important state, S\u00e3o Paulo, has maintained a strict quarantine and this week openly defied Bolsonaro, telling its 44 million citizens: \u201cDo not follow the guidance of the president.\u201d\nWilson Witzel, Rio de Janeiro state\u2019s rightwing governor, has also refused to back away from strict social isolation measures.\n\u201cSo far I\u2019ve been asking, now I am giving an order: don\u2019t leave your home,\u201d Witzel told his state\u2019s 17 million residents on Monday as he extended Rio\u2019s shut down for another fortnight.\nWitzel, a one-time Bolsonaro ally, went on to suggest the president\u2019s behaviour could land him a trial at the International Criminal Court in the Hague.\nOnly the rightwing governors of the Amazon states of Rond\u00f4nia and Roraima, both Bolsonaro allies, have followed the president\u2019s lead by relaxing restrictions on shops and businesses. In Roraima\u2019s capital Boa Vista and Rond\u00f4nia\u2019s capital Porto Velho many \u2013 but not all - shops are open and there are people on the streets. In Mato Grosso shops have also partially re-opened.\nCiro Gomes, a prominent leftwing politician from north-eastern Brazil, told the Guardian that in order to save thousands of lives, the country now needed \u2013 and was starting to witness \u2013 \u201can extensive campaign of civil disobedience initiated by governors, mayors, the overwhelming majority of religious leaders and the media\u201d.\nGomes admitted the loss of many lives was now inevitable \u2013 but such a mutiny against Bolsonaro could help lessen the scale of the tragedy and represented \u201can act of protection for the Brazilian people\u201d.\nBolsonaro has described coronavirus as a \u201clittle flu\u201d and claimed his athletic background would protect him from it. \u201cYou have to face it like a soldier on the battlefield,\u201d he told Rede TV on Monday. The previous day he told reporters: \u201cWe\u2019ll all die one day.\u201d\nThe president has argued the damage caused by shutting down Brazil\u2019s economy will be worse than that caused by the virus, and has also suggested state governors were inflating the numbers of coronavirus victims to justify restrictive lockdown measures.\nBut as well as facing a rebellion from regional chiefs, Bolsonaro now also appears increasingly isolated from his own cabinet.\nAt a press conference with other ministers on Monday, Bolsonaro\u2019s health minister Luiz Mandetta called on people to follow state governments and maintain the \u201cthe maximum degree of social isolation\u201d \u2013 a day after the president mingled with people on the streets of Bras\u00edlia and said he was considering a decree to let them go back to work.\nOn Tuesday the Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo newspaper reported that justice minister S\u00e9rgio Moro, finance minister Paulo Guedes, Mandetta and military officers in the government had formed a block opposing the president\u2019s stance.\n\u201cBolsonaro has put himself into self-isolation,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 \u00c1lvaro Mois\u00e9s, a professor of political science at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo.\nAdditional reporting by Tom Phillips in Rio de Janeiro",

BAT said its work was \u201cpotentially safer [than conventional vaccine technology], given that tobacco plants cannot host pathogens which cause human disease\u201d.\nBAT said it had engaged with the Food and Drug Administration in the US and the Department for Health and Social Care in the UK to \u201coffer our support and access to our research with the aim of trying to expedite the development of a vaccine for Covid-19\u201d.\nDr David O\u2019Reilly, the director of scientific research at BAT, said: \u201cVaccine development is challenging and complex work but we believe we have made a significant breakthrough with our tobacco plant technology platform, and we stand ready to work with governments and all stakeholders to help win the war against Covid-19.\n\u201cKBP has been exploring alternative uses of the tobacco plant for some time. One such alternative use is the development of plant-based vaccines.\u201d\nBAT said it had cloned a portion of the genetic sequence of the coronavirus and developed a potential antigen. The antigen was then inserted into tobacco plants for reproduction and, once the plants were harvested, the antigen was purified. It is now undergoing pre-clinical testing.\nThe tobacco firm is more typically on the receiving end of criticism from campaigning groups, including the use young and attractive models to entice younger demographics to try e-cigarettes and vaping technology.",

        "content": "The world\u2019s biggest arts festival is loved for its camaraderie and inspiration. This feels like cancelling Christmas \u2013 but performers will respond creatively\nThe story used to be about how enormous the Edinburgh fringe had become. As long ago as 1961, theatre director Gerard Slevin argued it would be \u201cmuch better if only 10 halls were licensed\u201d. Ever since, pundits have predicted the bubble would burst. But it has continued to grow. In recent years, the Fringe Society has taken to underplaying the enormity, believing size isn\u2019t everything. The figures, though, are hard to escape. In 2019, there were 3,841 shows in 323 venues.\nSo the idea that the world\u2019s biggest festival will not happen this year is hard to compute. It\u2019s like cancelling Christmas.\nToday\u2019s news that the fringe, along with the Edinburgh international festival, the Edinburgh international book festival, the Edinburgh art festival and the Royal Edinburgh military tattoo will not take place is not a surprise after the cancellation of the Glastonbury festival and postponement of the Tokyo Olympics. But it is still an enormous cultural blow.\nI say this not only as an Edinburgh resident who routinely clocks up 70 shows every August. The loss will be felt keenly in a city whose economy benefits year-round from the festivals. The combined audience of 4.4 million for the August festivals, with their 5,000 events involving over 25,000 artists from 70 countries, generates anything from \u00a3300m to \u00a31bn, depending on which report you read.\nThat is money that goes way beyond the cultural sector to every taxi driver, restaurant, landlord and shop in the city. For all the complaints about the intrusiveness of the festivals, that is money that will be missed.\nBut money is not the half of it. What price can you put on the rush of ideas, the thrill of artistic discovery, the creative friendships formed, the sheer stimulus of it all?\nNor is it just about this one city. Cast an eye across the recommendations for online entertainment to keep us going through the Covid-19 outbreak and the influence of the Edinburgh festivals is ever present. Most of the shows recorded in VR by Livr began at the fringe, the weekly online bills from the Stand comedy club would be nothing without the city and if you missed the Wooster Group\u2019s Hamlet in the international festival of 2013, you can see it for free until 7 April.\nIn normal circumstances, a hefty chunk of arts-centre programming across the UK would be generated by producers shopping for shows in Edinburgh. It\u2019s the same internationally: look at festival lineups from Ireland to Australia and you can work out exactly where in the Scottish capital the directors have been. The reason so many artists return to the festivals year after year is it sustains their careers.\nIn the standup comedy world in particular, it has become a kind of trade fair where promoters and TV execs can spot tomorrow\u2019s quiz-show contestants and Live at the Apollo stars. But it\u2019s not all venality.\nAsk Josie Long or Phill Jupitus or Bridget Christie why they do it and they\u2019ll talk less about money than collaboration, camaraderie and inspiration. Playing alongside their peers keeps them alive as artists, just as it does in all the artforms. I remember sitting behind comedian Stewart Lee watching the National Theatre of Scotland\u2019s Black Watch, just as I\u2019ve spotted playwrights at the book festival and actors in the art galleries. A student theatre-maker told me how thrilled he was to get feedback from a professional puppeteer who had come to see his show. Such nourishment and cross-pollination is as valuable as the publicity from good reviews, which, of course, opens doors long after the festival has finished.\nThere will be those who see this as an opportunity for the festivals to take stock. It could be a chance to return to the values of 1947 when the international festival was founded as a post-war \u201cplatform for the flowering of the human spirit\u201d \u2013 something of a contrast to the excesses and hedonistic pleasures of today. Well, maybe so. Artists have a way of responding creatively to adverse circumstances and let\u2019s hope it encourages some lateral thinking. In the meantime, the cancellation means we will all stay healthier, if a little less connected to the world.",

Do you want me to tell you what Tiger King is about?\nI don\u2019t think I have a choice. That\u2019s right. It is about the rivalry between different big cat owners, all of whom look like a cross between a retired WWE wrestler and Wagner from X Factor. Remember Wagner?\nNo. It doesn\u2019t matter.

What if I told you he didn\u2019t write or perform any of the songs on any of his albums?\nOh. Or that one of his songs was called Here Kitty Kitty, which directly claimed that his rival \u2013 Big Cat Rescue CEO Carole Baskin \u2013 fed her missing husband to his tigers?

It was also, upon launch, the most-watched thing on Netflix.\nBut isn\u2019t it a bit icky and exploitative? Oh, absolutely. Tiger King is a show about genuinely terrible people. It is exploitative, both to its subjects and the animals. It revels in humanity\u2019s basest instincts. It does that grubby Netflix thing of making the viewers complicit in all the terrible acts by giving notoriety to those who don\u2019t deserve it.\nIt sounds awful. It is awful.\nSo should I give it a miss? No! It is the perfect show for these weird, uncertain times and you should definitely watch it.\nDo say: \u201cTiger King is cruel and exploitative.\u201d\nDon\u2019t say: \u201cBut it\u2019s this or reconnecting with our loved ones, so we may as well watch it.\u201d",

Both chains, as well as Odeon and Empire Cinemas, have now said they will furlough employees along the lines of the government\u2019s coronavirus job retention scheme, which offers to cover 80% of employees\u2019 wages.\nHowever, Cineworld Action Group, formed of employees in the UK, has said that while they have been told that redundancies were reversed, some employees have not received confirmation that their jobs are protected. \u201cAnxieties are still running high due to the lack of communication and clarity. We hope that Cineworld will apologise to all staff for the way we were treated and that they will top up the remaining 20% of our wages.\u201d\nIn a statement, Cineworld said: \u201cThe government package was a real game changer and we wait for clarification regarding the details. The well-being of our employees has always been a top priority for Cineworld and the company will continue to support them as much as possible.\u201d\nOdeon Workers Union, which is not affiliated with entertainment workers\u2019 union Bectu, said that it had also been offered furlough terms (of three weeks, with an extension to 12 weeks) at 80% of current pay by Odeon, the UK\u2019s second-largest operator by market share. The union said: \u201cEmployees are kept in this precarious financial situation because it benefits management to not give us regular or consistent schedules. I was already barely making rent, and now 20% of my income is gone. Why should they be able to create conditions that make it hard for their employees to survive, and not be held responsible at a time of crisis?\u201d\nIn a statement, Odeon said: \u201cNone of our colleagues have been dismissed but in these unprecedented times, we believe that the best course of action is to place some of our cinema-based colleagues into furlough. This will ensure that they can benefit from the government-backed scheme at a time when all of our cinemas across the UK are temporarily closed, with no incoming revenue.\u201d\nAn employee of the Empire Cinemas, which operates 14 venues, told the Guardian that they had also been furloughed with 80% pay, with the company considering whether to top up the remaining 20% \u2013 but they had no confirmation of whether they would receive any money.\nIn a statement, Empire Cinemas said: \u201cFollowing the chancellor\u2019s welcome introduction of the coronavirus job retention scheme, Empire Cinemas have now moved to place the majority of its cinema employees within the remit of the scheme.\u201d\nThe UK\u2019s production sector has received an equally shattering blow, with all shoots cancelled at almost no notice. However, as the vast majority of film crew are freelance or self-employed, the UK government\u2019s initial set of measures did not offer any help. A follow-up scheme, which offered to pay 80% of income to those earning \u00a350,000 and under, is designed to plug the gap.\nMany in the sector, however, fear they are still falling through the cracks. Art director and production designer Blair Barnette says that tax regulations encouraged large numbers of industry personnel to set up as limited companies and operate as contractors, taking minimal PAYE salary and using the dividend as income \u2013 which, under the rules of the new scheme, means that Barnette will only receive a tiny grant. \u201cWe operate and earn inside the guidelines and the law. And the same government encouraged small businesses to set up and operate. Now when we need something back, we are told we don\u2019t qualify. There are a lot of us drowning right now.\u201d\nThe accounting systems employed by major Hollywood studios has reportedly only muddied the waters. A location manager, who also operates as a limited company and asked to remain anonymous, told the Guardian: \u201cI\u2019ve worked for one massive company for the last five years, but as each production sets up a new company to trade under, it looks like I\u2019ve kept changing employment even though the umbrella company is the same. I can\u2019t get access to any help at all, not even the mortgage holidays. There\u2019s no reward for loyalty in film and TV!\u201d\nBectu also points out that the stop-start nature of freelance work mean many workers were not under contract on 1 March, the government\u2019s cut-off point to receive help. A recent survey by the union suggests that almost 50% of film industry freelancers won\u2019t qualify. Bectu head Philippa Childs said in a statement: \u201cThe Treasury should make it clear that these workers can and should be rehired and furloughed by their last engager \u2026 It also needs to make the funds available for companies that are furloughing before the end of April as well as insisting employers furlough people rather than allowing them the choice.\u201d\nHowever, Bectu have praised Disney for its decision to furlough employees until May, which it announced on Tuesday after telling crew on 20 March their contracts would be terminated. Childs said: \u201cDisney is taking its responsibilities as an employer seriously and this is model behaviour that the rest of the industry should be looking to follow.\u201d\nAmong other initiatives, the BFI and the Film and TV Charity have backed a fund designed to provide short-term relief for production workers, which includes a \u00a31m donation from Netflix, and actors\u2019 union Equity has committed a similar sum to its own fund.",

The government needs an exit strategy, which may be gradual and initially involve those who have had the virus and are able to travel and go back to work. If we have a lockdown for too long there will be a rebellion against it.\u201d\nKing said it was pointless to speculate on the extent of the health and economic damage caused by the crisis, but emphasised that there would be significant costs in terms of failed businesses, lost jobs and increased unhappiness.\n\u201cIt is understandable that health officials focus on the broad-brush aspect of this \u2013 the need for a lockdown to diminish the spread of the virus,\u201d he said.\nBut the former Bank governor said it was also important to think about the mental health of people being made unemployed, or whose businesses were going bust.\n\u201cThere are people struggling to get out to buy food and who are stuck on their own. Young people are having their university education and school exams cancelled, and that it is going to have a significant impact of their wellbeing and future careers.\u201d\nKing added the government had made a deliberate decision to lock down the economy and so had a responsibility to ensure cash flow to businesses big and small, and to act as the customer of last resort.\nThe Treasury needed to speed up its plan to offer financial help to the self-employed because the target date of early June would be too late for many, he said.\nAlistair Darling, the chancellor responsible for bailing out stricken banks at the beginning of the 2008 crisis, said the government was failing to provide a consistent message on testing for Covid-19.\n\u201cIt is critical in any crisis that the message has clarity\u201d, Darling said. \u201cAt the moment we don\u2019t know whether the government is going beyond NHS staff to the public as a whole. Unless we know who has got it or who has had it, we are always going to be on the back foot.\u201d\nDarling also said the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, needed to make sure measures were having an impact where they were needed.\n\u201cIt is very easy to announce a policy, but much more difficult to get it delivered. The economic measures are absolutely vital, but for the self-employed delivery is going to take longer than people have got in many cases.\u201d",

        "content": "Andrew K\u00f6tting\u2019s dream-documentary traces a ritual journey in which a mysterious object is returned to a Scottish island \nThat unique artist, director and psycho-geographic savant Andrew K\u00f6tting sculpts another strange film-shamanic happening \u2013 intriguing, sometimes baffling, a bit preposterous, but pregnant with ideas. Tonally, his work is complex; humour is a part of it, and the film can\u2019t really function without humour on the audience\u2019s part, but it also requires a setting aside of mockery and irony, demanding instead to be accepted as a kind of higher playfulness, an inspired and transcendental jeu d\u2019\u00e9sprit. In his 2012 film Swandown, K\u00f6tting included among his cast of characters a cameo from the comedian Stewart Lee, who was permitted to take the mickey a bit. But I sense that this isn\u2019t a response that the film-maker wants to encourage.\nLike much of his previous work, this is a dream-documentary road movie, a journey across a physical and mental landscape \u2013 using both video and Super 8, in the enigmatic company, as so often before, of the author Iain Sinclair whose world view is a cousin to K\u00f6tting\u2019s. Sinclair\u2019s own film-prose-poem London Orbital from 2002, co-directed with Christopher Petit, and featuring an appearance from JG Ballard, is a point of comparison.\nWhat we are seeing here is the creation of a ritualised dramatic fiction, a film about a mysterious object that is itself a mysterious object, and the participants must enter into the spirit of it all with a straight face. The audience need not make exactly that commitment, although you do have to indulge it.\nThe premise is that artist Steve Dilworth has fabricated a box made out of whalebone, the size of a loaf of bread, taken from the remains of a whale that was beached on the Isle of Harris in Scotland. Now K\u00f6tting and Sinclair are going to bring this box back to where this event supposedly happened, bury it there, and so achieve a sort of mystical closure and a sense of oneness with the natural world. K\u00f6tting also uses some recorded statements on the soundtrack from Philip Hoare, author of the book Leviathan, or The Whale \u2013 and these statements themselves sound as if they are being transmitted via radio signals from another planet.\nOn the way, they make various important pit-stops, paying homage at landmarks. The Scottish artist and singer stage-named MacGillivray (otherwise Kirsten Norrie) performs some beautiful mermaid-style keening/singing over the box, and the conceit is that this will imbue it with greater power, like a charged spiritual battery.\nBut the most important parts of the film come when K\u00f6tting reflects on his daughter, Eden (also featured in his 2011 film Louyre: This Our Still Life), who has a genetic disorder. There are many enigmatic scenes in which Eden is shown in a wood, sitting on a chair, startlingly cradling a rifle \u2013 evidently not loaded \u2013 and sometimes peering through binoculars. K\u00f6tting ponders what Eden sees, what she feels, and he does so with an absolute refusal of sentimentality or condescension.\nThis whole thing, the whole elaborate business of transporting a whalebone box, could be an unacknowledged metaphor for his feelings about Eden, or displacement activity.\nAt its best, The Whalebone Box is folk horror without the horror, and there are some disturbing sequences imagining the box floating through stark woodland, as if in a nightmare. This film is a butterfly that won\u2019t be broken on any wheel; in fact, it\u2019s strong enough to break the wheel. I\u2019ve never quite known what to make of K\u00f6tting\u2019s work, but it always has an engaging and very human quality, and it is never dull.\n The Whalebone Box is available on Mubi from 3 April.",

Biles, who is arguably the greatest gymnast of all time, was expected to win multiple golds in Tokyo this year.\nHow did @Simone_Biles receive news that the 2020 Olympics were postponed?\"I was in the gym training...I didn't really know what to feel. I just kind of sat there and I cried. But ultimately it was the right decision,\" she says. pic.twitter.com/UtOPD2SNjK\n\u201cPhysically I have no doubts that my coaches will get me back in shape, but mentally going another year, I think that is what\u2019s going to take the toll on me and all of us and most of the athletes,\u201d the American told NBC\u2019s Today show. \u201cWe have to stay in shape mentally just as much as physically. That will play a big factor moving forward, listening to your body and your mind.\u201d\nBiles will be 24 when the Games start next year, an age when most Olympic gymnasts have long since retired. She says the decision to delay the Olympics was correct.\n\u201cI was actually in the gym training at the time because we were allowed under 10 people ... and I went to the locker and between rotations and I got a text,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t really know what to feel.

        "content": "Uefa has called off June\u2019s round of international fixtures, including the Euro 2020 play-offs, and has postponed the current Champions League and Europa League campaigns until further notice amid the coronavirus crisis. It is understood that one option under consideration is that the two club competitions could now be completed in July and August.\nThe governing body of European football met on Wednesday with general secretaries or chief executives of all its affiliated 55 national football associations, including the four British FAs, to receive updates from two working groups formed on 17 March to plot a way the game can resume following the total shutdown of professional sport this past month. The outcome was an almost complete suspension of activity until further notice, from youth competitions to the continent\u2019s most prestigious tournaments in both the men\u2019s and women\u2019s games.\nWith this summer\u2019s men\u2019s European Championship having already been postponed until 2021, pressure to complete the play-offs \u2013 which include Scotland v Israel, Bosnia-Herzegovina v Northern Ireland and Slovakia v Republic of Ireland \u2013 is not imminent. England\u2019s two scheduled friendly matches in June, in Austria and at home to Romania at Villa Park, are also off.\nThe question of what to do with the Champions League and Europa League, however, is more pressing. Both competitions were suspended in March with four ties remaining to be completed in the Champions League last 16, including Manchester City\u2019s with Real Madrid and Chelsea\u2019s with Bayern Munich. In the Europa League, none of the eight last-16 ties have been completed, with two first legs yet to take place.\nThe women\u2019s Champions League had reached the quarter-final stage but none of the four first-leg ties had been played.\nWhile a proposal to play the remaining matches in both men\u2019s competitions in the summer months was one plan put under consideration, it is also accepted that the later they are delayed the more preference must be given to the completion of domestic seasons.\nA Uefa representative said the working group set up to examine rescheduling possibilities discussed different scenarios only on the basis that all matches will be completed, by the end of August at the latest. The meeting, held by video conference as all of Europe\u2019s football and club administrators are in effect working from their homes, did not discuss the different decisions that the game could face if the current season cannot be concluded by August.\nWith an acceptance that finishing by the end of June is now in effect impossible and even starting by then is optimistic, the working group is understood to have modelled different possibilities for restarting competitions, if an end of June date is possible, or July, and finishing them by August. The group has not modelled stripping back the remaining Champions and Europa League ties, for example by reducing two-legged rounds to one match. Different ways of trying to conclude competitions have been considered such as trying to finish domestic league seasons first then completing the Uefa competitions rapidly, all in one go, after that.\nUefa stressed, as it did when the Euros were postponed, that many of Europe\u2019s FAs will suffer a severe financial hit from missing out on international football, including friendlies, whose TV rights are now mostly sold centrally by Uefa, which distributes the money to the member associations. All FAs will now lose or have delayed this TV and matchday income, and for many of the smaller football countries\u2019 FAs such revenues are very important to funding their administration costs and development programmes.\nAn effort will be made to reschedule all the postponed friendlies next season, possibly by squeezing international breaks to take in three matches rather than the two that have been standard for years. Doing so will require a slight lengthening of international breaks to enable three matches to be played with the required 72 hours between them, and for clubs to agree that players can be released to play three matches.\nThe English Premier League is set to discuss its own contingency plans at an extraordinary shareholders\u2019 meeting on Friday. One plan involves completing the domestic season during June and July, should conditions allow. While it is also just one of a number of potential solutions set to be discussed, it would have consequences for any plans made by Uefa.\nAt this stage, ho wever, potential rescheduling remains only so many marks on a piece of paper. With coronavirus cases and deaths continuing to rise in Europe and across the world, no one can say with any confidence when professional sport will resume or even in what form.",

Not for nothing was the company known by its Spanish name \u2013 La Nueve or La Espa\u00f1ola.\nOne hundred and forty-six of the company\u2019s 160 men were Spanish and, despite serving in the French army and under a French commanding officer, they were permitted to stitch the red, yellow and purple flag of Spain\u2019s second republic on to their uniforms.\nThey were also allowed to paint the flag on their vehicles, which rolled into Paris emblazoned with names such as Guernica and Don Quichotte (Don Quixote). Spanish was the common language within the company and all had fought during the liberation of French north Africa.\nThe company, led by the Spanish Lt Amado Granell, was the first to enter Paris on 24 August 1944 through the Porte d\u2019Italie, in the south of the city. As they awaited the official surrender of the German governor of occupied Paris, Dietrich von Choltitz, La Nueve troops were sent to occupy public buildings and those taken over by the German military command, as well as Place de la Concorde.\nGranell entered City Hall at about 8.40pm local time and met with the head of the national council of the French resistance. Captain, later colonel, Raymond Dronne, the commander of La Nueve, wrote in his memoirs that he fell asleep in the early hours of the morning to the sound of Spanish songs.\nAllied troops led by Gen Charles de Gaulle entered Paris the following day. More than 50 members of La Nueve received the Croix de Guerre for bravery.\nIn his victory speech a day later on 26 August 1944 , De Gaulle did not mention the Spanish soldiers.\n\u201cParis is outraged. Paris is destroyed. Paris is martyred. But Paris is liberated! Liberated by itself, liberated by its people with the help of the armies of France,\u201d he said.\nLa Nueve\u2019s contribution to the city\u2019s liberation has only recently been recognised. The company was forgotten or left out of the French history books for political reasons \u2013 with the liberation presented as an exclusively French triumph. It was only in August 2004 \u2013 60 years later \u2013 that Paris officially paid homage to the division with a plaque.\nGranell died in 1972 in a road accident on his way to the French consulate in Valencia, Spain, where was going to claim his veteran\u2019s salary.\n\u201cThey liberated Paris, but not just Paris,\u201d the city\u2019s mayor, Anne Hidalgo, has said. \u201cThe liberation of this city was celebrated all over the world as a victory for freedom. Although much lay ahead in the struggle to defeat Nazism, people say the bells rang out as far away as Buenos Aires when they entered Paris.\u201d\nLater, G\u00f3mez Nieto was awarded the Grande M\u00e9daille de Vermeil and the L\u00e9gion d\u2019Honneur.\nJos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda \u201cChato\u201d Galante, a veteran campaigner for truth, justice and historical memory in Spain who was imprisoned and tortured under the Franco dictatorship, also died recently from coronavirus.\nOn learning of Galante\u2019s death, Spain\u2019s deputy prime minister, Pablo Iglesias, tweeted: \u201cCovid-19 has taken Chato Galante, freedom fighter, political prisoner during the dictatorship, campaigner for universal justice and against torturers \u2013 one of Brecht\u2019s indispensables.

        "content": "Eddie Howe has become the first Premier League manager to take a voluntary pay cut, offering to work on substantially reduced wages at Bournemouth as top-flight clubs begin to get to grips with the coronavirus pandemic.\nHowe, who earns \u00a33m a year, and his assistant, Jason Tindall, are among four of the club\u2019s highest earners to volunteer a decrease in wages with immediate effect, with the technical director, Richard Hughes, and chief executive, Neill Blake, also taking significant cuts in pay for the foreseeable future. Bournemouth have placed more than 50 staff on furlough but have agreed to top up government payments to ensure employees continue to be paid in full.\nOfficials from the Premier League, Professional Footballers\u2019 Association and the English Football League are expected to reconvene on Friday to determine solutions regarding player wages after discussions on Wednesday.\nA variety of approaches have been taken so far, including Leeds players agreeing a wage deferral, Birmingham players being asked to accept a 50% cut in pay and Forest Green putting their squad on furlough. The first-team squads of several top European clubs including Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Juventus have agreed wage cuts.\nHowe\u2019s wage cut comes a day after the Tottenham chairman, Daniel Levy, urged Premier League managers and players to sacrifice some of their income during football\u2019s enforced shutdown. \u201cWe hope the discussions between the Premier League, PFA and LMA will result in players and coaches doing their bit for the football ecosystem,\u201d Levy said.\nBournemouth have joined Norwich, Newcastle and Tottenham in furloughing employees, some of whom are club shop, catering and hospitality staff. Bournemouth said the move would \u201csafeguard the financial stability of the club during what is such an uncertain period, not only in football but for businesses in all industries across the world\u201d.\nA statement from the board added: \u201cThere is no script for moments like this. No tactics and no set plays to find a winning formula. But as a board we are continually looking at ways to ensure the future of the club and our employees is protected when the season returns.\u201d\nOn Tuesday Howe said he was concerned for the \u201cmental wellbeing\u201d of some his players amid the absence of football. He told the Daily Echo: \u201cThe guys with families will probably have their days filled up, like mine are being, with their children, having people around the house and not feeling isolated.\n\u201cBut it\u2019s the single guys, maybe the people that don\u2019t have a wife or a girlfriend and definitely don\u2019t have kids. They are the ones I am most worried about. I have tried to keep in contact with the players as best I can, without ringing up with nothing to say.\u201d\nSwansea City of the Championship announced voluntary wage deferrals on Wednesday, with manager Steve Cooper and Trevor Birch taking temporary pay cuts after the club confirmed the majority of non-playing staff will be placed on furlough. Last month Swansea offered the use of their Liberty Stadium to the emergency services to aid the battle against the coronavirus crisis.\nBrentford are understood to be close to reaching an agreement with their players over taking a temporary wage cut and Birch suggested Swansea\u2019s players could follow suit following talks between football\u2019s stakeholders across the next 48 hours.",

It also produced some of the first uncommitted logic arrays (ULAs), used in early home computers such as the Sinclair ZX81, Sinclair ZX Spectrum and BBC Micro.\nAs Ferranti\u2019s sales and marketing director he travelled the world and was a frequent visitor to Silicon Valley in the early days of its computer-related activity. His customers included Alan Sugar and Clive Sinclair.\nBorn in Westerhope, Newcastle upon Tyne, to Ernie, a deputy manager at the nearby Walbottle colliery, and Alice (nee Thackwray), Bryan had one older brother, Alan, who died of cancer at the age of 45.\nAfter Gosforth grammar school (now Gosforth academy), he did his national service in the RAF. Learning the ropes as a radio operator led him to study electronic engineering at the EMI College of Electronics in London, where he graduated with a City & Guilds qualification.\nIt was in London that Bryan met Mo Green, then a trainee physiotherapist, whom he married in 1963. That year he started work with Ferranti and they moved to Stockport, Greater Manchester, remaining there for the rest of their lives.\nLater Bryan had a brief period with Texas Instruments, but he returned to Ferranti and stayed there until his retirement in the early 1990s, after which he pursued a short career in management consultancy. In 1985 he was awarded the Prince Philip medal, which honours those who have made the most of their talents and have seen significant success since completing their City & Guilds qualification.\nAlongside his early working life, Bryan sang with the Four Folk \u2013 a group known for hosting great nights at the Two Brewers pub in Salford. Their guests included Labi Siffre and Ewan MacColl. In their seven-year history the Four Folk recorded one LP \u2013 Hard Cases (1966) \u2013 and appeared on regional and national TV. They were also performers on BBC radio programmes such as Folk on 2 and The Good Old Days.\nGentle and funny, Bryan was a popular man who enjoyed an active retirement. He was a member of Romiley Operatic Society and was also a keen metal detectorist, drummer, tennis player and skier. He was a great supporter of Stockport County FC and in his 80s joined the Woodlarks choir, which sang at his funeral.\nHe is survived by Mo, his children, Rick, Rach and me, and his grandsons, Dan, Luke, Max and Charlie.\n This article was amended on 2 July 2021 to correct the family name of Bryan Down\u2019s mother, Alice, to Thackwray. It was earlier given as Thackeray.",

        "content": "Experts say new evidence from Cretaceous period \u2018shows us what carbon dioxide can do\u2019\nThink of Antarctica and it is probably sweeping expanses of ice, and the odd penguin, that come to mind. But at the time of the dinosaurs the continent was covered in swampy rainforest.\nNow experts say they have found the most southerly evidence yet of this environment in plant material extracted from beneath the seafloor in west Antarctica.\nThe Cretaceous, 145m to 66m years ago, was a warm period during which Earth had a greenhouse climate and vegetation grew in Antarctica.\nScientists say the new discovery not only reveals that swampy rainforests were thriving near the south pole about 90m years ago but that temperatures were higher than expected. Such conditions, they add, could only have been produced if carbon dioxide levels were far higher than previously thought and there were no glaciers in the region.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t know that this Cretaceous greenhouse climate was that extreme,\u201d said Dr Johann Klages of the Alfred Wegener Institute in Germany and a co-author of the research. \u201cIt shows us what carbon dioxide is able to do.\u201d\nWriting in the journal Nature, the team explained how, in 2017, they drilled a narrow hole down into the seafloor near the Pine Island glacier in west Antarctica. This location is about 2,000km (1,200 miles) from today\u2019s south pole, but about 90m years ago it was about 900km from the pole.\nThe hole was drilled and material extracted using a remotely operated rig. \u201cIt is like a spaceship sitting on the seafloor,\u201d said Klages.\nThe first few metres of material were glacial sediment, dating to about 25,000 years ago, while the next 25m were sandstone, dating to about 45m years ago \u2013 something Klages said was of little interest to the team.\nAs they worked, a huge field of sea ice was approaching. \u201cIt was getting a little dangerous,\u201d said Klages. \u201cWe said: \u2018OK, three more metres and then we can evacuate the coring site here.\u2019 And in this three metres we had this exciting new material.\u201d\nThis three-metre section was composed of mudstone, topped by a coal-like material, and packed with soil from the ancient forest, complete with roots, spores and pollen \u2013 with the latter identified as coming from plants including conifer trees and ferns.\n\u201cIt is like if you would go to a forest near your house somewhere and drill a hole into the forest soil,\u201d said Klages. \u201cIt is really pristine \u2026 it was amazing.\u201d\nThe team found evidence of more than 65 different kinds of plants within the material, revealing that the landscape near the south pole would have been covered in a swampy conifer rainforest similar to that found today in the north-western part of the South Island of New Zealand. The material was dated to between 92m and 83m years ago.\nIt would have had average annual temperatures of 12-13C (53-55F), \u201cwhich is warmer than in Germany today\u201d, Klages said, adding that analysis of chemicals left by photosynthetic organisms called cyanobacteria revealed that surface waters, for example of lakes, would have been a pleasant 20C.\nCrucially, said Kages, computer modelling shows that such an environment so close to the south pole \u2013 where in the winter there is darkness for four months \u2013 would only have been possible if greenhouse gas concentrations were far higher than previously thought and the land surface were covered in vegetation.\nIn other words there were no ice sheets present \u2013 something Klages noted had been a matter of debate.\nDr James Bendle, an expert in organic geochemistry from the University of Birmingham, said that studying the Antarctic ecosystem was hugely important in understanding past and future climate change, adding that unabated use of fossil fuels use could push concentrations of carbon dioxide to levels similar to those 90m years ago by the start of the next century.\n\u201cUltimately, if we have an atmosphere of more than 1,000 parts per million of carbon dioxide, we are committing ourselves to a future planet that has little to no ice, and ultimately an Antarctic continent that would be vegetated and wouldn\u2019t have an ice cover,\u201d he said.",

As far as we know, Finland is the only country in the world to have defined social media as \u2018critical operators\u2019,\u201d \u2013 along with doctors, bus drivers and supermarket workers.\nThe project is a joint initiative by the office of Finland\u2019s 34-year-old prime minister, Sanna Marin, a Helsinki social media consultancy, and Mediapool, a network of media companies tasked with helping ensure citizens\u2019 access to reliable information at all times.\nA consultancy, PING Helsinki, edits government announcements so they fit easily into a social media format and sends them to a network of 1,500 influencers on its books, who are free to use words and images as they like, according to Politico.\n\u201cIt\u2019s about supporting social media influencers in sharing reliable information related to the coronavirus, and helping ensure that the right information is available on all channels at the right time,\u201d the company said. \u201cBy working together, we can prevent the spread of false information.\u201d\nPING said the goals of the project were set in 2018, when they sounded \u201cfar-reaching, even distant\u201d: developing tools to enhance the credibility of social media influencers and securing reliable information in crisis situations. \u201cWe wondered if it was bit of an overreaction,\u201d it said. \u201cWhat crisis situation might we face?\u201d\nThe company has also published a list of social media does and don\u2019ts during the coronavirus crisis, including recommendations such as stop and think before sharing; review content critically; distinguish fact from opinion; check facts and never share false information.\nEmmi Nuorgam, a writer, journalist, blogger and columnist with a large social media following, told the Finnish public broadcaster YLE that the pandemic \u201chighlights how panic can spread on social media, and how difficult it is to curb if the authorities\u2019 message does not get to where people actually are\u201d.\nNuorgam said many social influencers \u201cnow reach the same number of people as, say, newspapers or commercial radio channels. Some audiences are insanely big. Many may have tens or hundreds of thousands of followers.\u201d\nA factual video about the coronavirus produced by a Finnish YouTuber, Roni Back, interviewing a government minister and a number of health experts, had over 100,000 views within two days of launch, she said. \u201cPeople get their information differently nowadays,\u201d she added.",

But, if anyone in your home gets symptoms, they should stay at home for 7 days from the day their symptoms start.\u00a0Even if it means they're at home for longer than 14 days.\nIf you live with someone who is 70 or over, has a long-term condition, is pregnant or has a weakened immune system, try to find somewhere else for them to stay for 14 days.\nIf you have to stay at home together, try to keep away from each other as much as possible.\nAfter 7 days, if you no longer have a high temperature you can return to your normal routine.\nIf you still have a high temperature, stay at home until your temperature returns to normal.\nIf you still have a cough after 7 days, but your temperature is normal, you do not need to continue staying at home. A cough can last for several weeks after the infection has gone.\nStaying at home means you should:\nYou can use your garden, if you have one. You can also leave the house to exercise \u2013 but stay at least 2 metres away from other people.\nIf you have symptoms of coronavirus, use the\u00a0NHS 111 coronavirus service\u00a0to find out what to do.\nSource:\u00a0NHS England\u00a0on 23 March 2020\nMarie Curie, the end-of-life charity, urged clinicians to show compassion and make efforts to allow close family to be with loved ones, saying it was an \u201cimportant part of their duty of care\u201d.\nIt follows the death of 13-year old Ismail Mohamed Abdulwahab in London\u2019s King\u2019s College hospital on Monday without his family by his side. They said on Wednesday that their devastation had been made more difficult by not being with him.\nMany hospitals are operating a no-visit policy to restrict the spread of infection, with exceptions only made by special arrangement at the end of life and only for one person. Some provide tablet computers and smart phones as an alternative, but relatives have spoken of their distress at not being allowed to be there as loved ones die. King\u2019s College hospital is operating a guideline that allows end-of-life visits by one person, but it is not clear if this includes Covid-19 sufferers.\nA statement on a fundraiser web page for Ismail\u2019s funeral, which had raised nearly \u00a360,000 by Wednesday afternoon, said: \u201cSadly he died without any family members close by due to the highly infectious nature of Covid-19.\u201d\nFamily friend and spokesperson Mark Stephenson told Good Morning Britain: \u201cOne of the saddest things in this whole situation is that he died alone.\n\u201cAs you know, when someone has got this infection they\u2019re in isolation. So how difficult it is for a mum not to be able to be with her son at this time when he\u2019s sick?\u201d\nIsmail\u2019s family called on the public to follow the government\u2019s social distancing rules as it was clear the virus was attacking people of all ages. They urged people to \u201cstay at home as much as they possibly can, to protect the NHS and save lives\u201d.\n\u201cIsmail was a loving son, brother, nephew to our family and a friend to many people who knew him,\u201d they said. \u201cHis smile was heart-warming and he was always gentle and kind. He leaves behind six siblings who are completely devastated and this has been made more difficult not being able to be with Ismail while he was in the hospital.\u201d\nYoung people remain many times less likely to die of Covid-19 than the elderly. In China, the average age at which people died from Covid-19 was very similar to the average age at which people died normally, according to a Brookings Institute study.\nEarlier this week, Tricia Conroy, the daughter of Frank Hammond, 83, who died in Stepping Hill hospital in Stockport, described the \u201chorrendous, heartbreaking\u201d experience of being in contact with him on the phone before he died when they had wanted to be by his side.\nMarie Curie urged clinicians to consider the wishes of the dying when considering whether visits are possible.\n\u201cWe need to get through to the people making these decisions that we understand the complexity of the situation and the dilemma they are in,\u201d said Simon Jones, director of policy at the charity. \u201cBut take a moment to think about what is achievable. Is it achievable to isolate the individual in a room? Is it possible to give a small group of people close to them the full personal protective equipment they need to be with them in their last hours?\u201d\n\u201cPeople want to depart this world in the comfort of those who love them wrapped around them,\u201d said Jones. \u201cSomeone holding their hand, resting a hand on their forehead or cradling them \u2013 it\u2019s a human emotion to want to help someone through the passage from life into death. The experience of being there when someone takes their last breath for many people is very helpful in the grieving process.\u201d\nHe said taking steps to bring people together, if possible without spreading infection, could have \u201can important impact on where this nation is in terms of the grief and bereavement left behind\u201d.\nShirley Potts, regional development director of Child Bereavement UK, said: \u201cThere will be awful consequences of people who feel the way their loved one died has impacted greatly on their grief. We have an innate concern to have people die close to members of their family. If it was one of my children or grandchildren I would desperately want to be with them.\u201d\nBut she said medics had to weigh this with limiting the spread of the virus and she added that in many cases, the dying person may not be aware of what is going on around them.",

That night it started to fall.\n\u201cTo my surprise, it did not come back,\u201d she recalls of the fever. \u201cMy body finally began to fight it off and the next day they told me I could go home the day after if everything stayed stable.\n\u201cI was so relieved.

It was the most terrifying experience of my life.\u201d\nMore than 29,000 people across the UK are confirmed to have contracted Covid-19, and it is thought that thousands more have it.

She was rushed to hospital along with her husband, who was also symptomatic. She was tested for Covid-19 on Friday and is still awaiting her results.\nIn hospital she was put on a drip and given a variety of drugs, and her condition stabilised.

I\u2019m experiencing a vicarious nostalgia, a longing to see just how much the past was a foreign country, and how differently things were done. I\u2019ve been cruising the many free titles on BFI Player. These include the public information films A-tish-oo (1941), a short wartime guide to preventing germs from \u201cdirect, projective infection\u201d and How to Use the Telephone (1948), a lengthy film made up of dramatic reconstructions, wonderfully wringing all it can out of its subject matter.\nAs I live in London, documentary pioneer Marion Grierson\u2019s So This Is London (1933), was bittersweet. We see London bustling with people and promise. And as day turns to night, the commentator tells us: \u201cLondon the city of pleasure takes over from London the city of commerce.\u201d Oh, how I long to go out!\nIt was joyous to discover the TV musical The Rise and Fall of Nellie Brown (1964). In a twist on The Wizard of Oz, an unhappy 13-year-old girl from Liverpool, Selina (Millie Small, who sang My Boy Lollipop) goes on a road trip in search of her relative (the great Elisabeth Welch), who poignantly sings: \u201cA million years ago, or was it yesterday, the world belonged to us \u2026\u201d\nOver on Talking Pictures TV, which can always be depended upon for hidden, older gems, I fell in love with a film I\u2019d never seen before, Jack Lee\u2019s Turn the Key Softly (1953). Starring Yvonne Mitchell, Kathleen Harrison and Joan Collins, it tells a moving story of three women from very different backgrounds who leave prison and vow to meet up later to discuss their first day of freedom.\nIn reaction to becoming locked in and much more isolated, I started an online film club, #FridayFilmClub. It\u2019s every Friday at 8pm, open to all, and there is an option for discussion on Twitter afterwards. Screenings so far include two films in the public domain: Ida Lupino\u2019s impressive film noir The Bigamist (1953), where marriage is the crime, and Nina Paley\u2019s gloriously trippy, uplifting animation Sita Sings the Blues (2008), which features historical parallels of marriage alongside fantastic 1930s musical interludes by Annette Hanshaw. Knowing that we were watching these films simultaneously, as a connected audience, certainly helped my mind from drifting too far to the dark side.",

        "content": "Regional leaders welcome news that long-haul buses ferrying travellers along the coast have been suspended\nGreyhound bus services from Sydney to Brisbane have been suspended, as regional leaders across Australia plead with backpackers and city residents to stay away from coastal and country towns to slow the spread of coronavirus.\nThe Greens state MP for Ballina, Tamara Smith, and the Byron Bay mayor, Simon Richardson, who have been lobbying the New South Wales government to stop long-haul buses ferrying backpackers into regional areas, welcomed news that Wednesday\u2019s Greyhound bus from Sydney was the last into Byron Bay for the foreseeable future. It arrived just after midday with more backpackers on board.\n\u201cI was prepared to go in hard,\u201d Richardson said. He had spoken to Byron\u2019s police about meeting the buses and stopping backpackers breaching the Covid-19 movement restrictions. Under the latest measures, travelling for a holiday is an offence in New South Wales and Victoria, but it is not clear how the restrictions apply to backpackers who have no fixed address.\nSix passengers got off Wednesday\u2019s bus, including 18-year-old Finnish backpackers Lles Shign and Lynn Maendartsma, who in the past fortnight since leaving Sydney have visited Newcastle, Port Macquarie and Coffs Harbour.\n\u201cWe are not frightened,\u201d Maendartsma said. \u201cOur greatest fear is getting stuck in one place, giving all our money out and doing nothing.\u201d\nThe pair, who recently finished high school in Finland, are staying in a backpacker hostel and plan to visit Byron\u2019s beaches.\n\u201cWe are just going to relax in Byron and chill a little bit,\u201d Shign said. \u201cWe wanted to go to Brisbane but that\u2019s not an option any more.\u201d On Wednesday the Queensland government announced that only people with permits for essential travel would be allowed to cross the state border from Friday.\nThe two Finnish travellers hope to spend at least another month in Australia and are planning \u201cday to day\u201d.\nBoarding the bus, which was travelling on to Brisbane, was English backpacker Danny Wright. He spent the night in a Byron hostel after leaving Sydney on Tuesday morning. In the past three weeks he has been to Tasmania and Melbourne and is on his way to Airlie Beach in north Queensland, where he will live with friends who own a house. He plans to bunker down there for the corona crisis and is optimistic of finding work.\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough for backpackers, hostels are closing, but the ones I\u2019ve been staying in are doing everything they can, making sure there\u2019s that 1.5 metres and only 50% capacity in a room. We have no other options.\u201d\nWright said he did not want to return to the UK because he would need to stay with elderly family members, and feared making them sick.\n\u201cFrom all the news I\u2019ve been watching, Australia seems to be one of the safest places in the world.\u201d\nGerman backpacker Julian Luss, 18, is living in a Byron hostel with about 30 other people \u2013 two to three people per dorm room. He wants to go home but can\u2019t get a flight until 10 April.\n\u201cWe\u2019re staying calm and enjoying the rest of our time in Australia,\u201d he said. \u201cThere isn\u2019t as much partying as there used to be. Some people are still staying out and having a few drinks with their friends, but with social distancing.\u201d\nSmith wants all holidaymakers to stay away from regional areas.\n\u201cOur hospital system in terms of numbers of intensive care beds is minimal, meagre, so in a pandemic will be stressed for our communities,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can\u2019t look after visitors.\u201d\nShe has called on online holiday booking websites such as Airbnb and Stayz to stop marketing regional properties as ideal places for self-isolation.\n\u201cPeople think that if they are going to be in lockdown, they should be in a beautiful area, and that is understandable, but we do not have the capacity to support them. It\u2019s not fair on regional communities.\u201d\nRichardson said he was in talks with Byron celebrities to create a social media campaign to persuade visitors to stay away from regional areas. Chris Hemsworth, Bernard Fanning and Tex Perkins led Byron Bay\u2019s fundraiser after northern NSW was hit by bushfires.\nIn the past week the Rural Doctors Association of Australia has called on grey nomads to stop visiting outback towns.\nIn Queensland, caravan vendors told Guardian Australia queries for vans were strong, as city residents head for more remote areas and what they perceive as safety from coronavirus. The federal Nationals MP David Littleproud has described touring caravans as potential \u201ccruise ships of the outback\u201d.",

        "content": "As coronavirus keeps us apart, I have developed a very wholesome thirst for the physical intimacy we used to have with friends and family \nLately, when I find myself reaching for my phone for a distraction, it\u2019s no longer just to mindlessly swipe through Instagram stories and semi-ironically decipher my horoscope. Instead, I catch myself constantly returning to my camera roll. In particular, the photos where I\u2019m touching my family and friends.\nThere\u2019s the fuzzy Christmas party set of my colleagues and I, all cheek to cheek, craning our heads to get in a series of group selfies. There\u2019s a backyard family lunch, me with my arm slung over my mum\u2019s shoulder. There\u2019s a day at the beach with my sister and her kid, us each holding a hand as we drag her back to the car. And there\u2019s Mardis Gras night. It was just a few weeks ago but today the photos feel as though they belong in a history book. Friends and strangers covered in glitter and sweat, dancing close at a street party, arms wrapped around waists, exuberant kisses being planted on faces, all of us joyfully, drunkenly close to each other and vigorously engaged in whatever the opposite of social distancing is.\nI\u2019m experiencing a new and very wholesome kind of thirst.\nAs the coronavirus crisis deepens, we are moving further and further away from each other. If we\u2019re lucky enough to still have a job, we are mostly working from home. The latest wave of lockdown restrictions have made seeing friends and family outside the home almost impossible (unless you\u2019re wearing activewear). Even the physical proximity of strangers has evaporated. We leave bigger and bigger gaps as we pass on the street and step back from each other in the supermarket. If you live alone, it might be weeks since you touched another person, and months before you will again.\nOne of the greatest paradoxes of this moment is most of us are feeling more tender and afraid than we ever have, and want nothing more than to pull close the people we love, to seek reassurance and comfort. Yet, for the first time in our lives, unless we live together, we can\u2019t do this \u2013 not physically, at least.\nThis is all the sadder because touch \u2013 when it\u2019s wanted, when it\u2019s caring \u2013 is so good for us. It connects us to each other. It is our most primal form of communication. Years of research suggests it\u2019s beneficial for our physical and mental health, lifting our mood and decreasing stress. Newborn babies thrive on skin-to-skin contact. Every kid knows the power of \u201ckissing it better\u201d when you get hurt, or being patted off to sleep by a reassuring hand.\nAdults too can experience a true \u201cskin hunger\u201d when they go long periods without touch, as the illustrator Kristen Radtke explored in the New York Times this week.\nRight now though most of us are so wary of touch, even of hugging our parents.\nI saw my mum last week and she moved towards me on pure instinct, her arms out. I jumped back, like a teenager about to get an embarrassing goodbye kiss at the school gate. We may yet all need to do what the mother of the ABC journalist Emilia Terzon did last week \u2013 building ingenious protective \u201ccuddle suits\u201d out of garbage bags so they could give each other a squeeze.\nEven one of the most familiar rituals in most families \u2013 greeting returning loved ones at the airport with wide open arms \u2013 is impossible now. Last week my sister, her wife and their three-year-old daughter arrived home from New York after beating a hasty retreat from their life in a city rapidly descending into a public health nightmare. They have another baby due in a couple of months. No one could even go to the airport to meet them, let alone embrace them.\nWhen I have seen them, it is with a gulf between us. I drop groceries and bottles of wine on the stoop of the Airbnb where they are quarantining, then retreat back to the front gate to sit out on the footpath when my sister comes to the door.\nMy niece has to be physically restrained from barrelling out of the house towards visitors. A champion hugger, hair-messer and tickler, not being able to be physical with her grandparents, extended family or friends means she has become exponentially more handsy with her mums. \u201cShe crawls at the walls, she crawls on us,\u201d my sister says.\nWith all this touch deprivation, the most common wish I see expressed among people on social media is to hug their friends and family when this is all over. That is unless you\u2019ve been forced into celibacy, in which case you\u2019re naturally concerned with  another kind of physical intimacy.\n\u201cThe world is going to be an intense cuddle puddle on the streets,\u201d my friend Que Minh Luu tweeted last week. \u201cIt\u2019ll be like that iconic end of the world war photo, except with active consent.\u201d\nWhen this is over, I for one cannot wait to go HAM on all my friends. I daydream about the first dancefloor we can get on, wrapping them up and smooshing their faces. I will never not let my mum hold my hand again, no matter where we are. I will let my toddler niece use me as a human climbing gym and I look forward to nibbling on the fat little legs of her new sibling. If everyone I love makes it through this, I want to put my arms around them all. We\u2019ll need it.",

        "content": "Alek Sigley was studying in Pyongyang when he was blindfolded and taken to an interrogation facility where his handlers demanded he confess to his \u2018crimes\u2019\n\u201cDo you know what day it is?\u201d asked the man as we sat in the black Mercedes-Benz that had whisked me from the foreign student dormitory at Kim Il-sung university, where I had been living in the North Korean capital Pyongyang. I knew full well, but he answered his own question: \u201cIt\u2019s the day the US imperialists invaded and started the war.\u201d\nIt was Tuesday 25 June, and the start of my nine long days of interrogation at the hands of the North Korean ministry of state security \u2013 or at least that\u2019s who I believed it was, as they never revealed who they actually were.\nThat morning a gruff stranger had approached me in the internet room of the dormitory. I was in the third semester of my master\u2019s degree in Korean literature and was finishing off my homework about a North Korean short story ahead of an afternoon class.\n\u201cYou\u2019re attending a meeting at university, come with me right now,\u201d the man said. Something was off, he had an overbearing manner and latent aggression in his expression.\nWe sometimes had meetings on campus before, but I had an ominous feeling this one would be different.\nAs I followed the man and his companion out of the front door and turned the corner to the parking lot at the side, I saw the black Mercedes-Benz, which had a black plastic bag covering its licence plate.\n\u201cFuck, you\u2019re in deep shit now,\u201d I thought to myself.\nI was ushered into the middle back seat, the man and his colleague sitting on either side. Very quickly they were replaced, as if choreographed, by two much larger men \u2013 with the man who had asked that first question of me seated in the front passenger seat. This man, who I knew only by the appellation of \u201cteacher\u201d (sonsaengnim), would be my lead interrogator.\nI had been quite enjoying my time at the university. The interrogation, on the other hand, was not much fun. I spent nine days in a room completely cut off from the outside world. There was no clock, and I had to sleep with the light on.\nOn that first day they chose to give me a warm welcome, blindfolding me in the car as they read out a long list of crimes I had supposedly committed against the North Korean state. Upon arrival at the interrogation facility, I was escorted in by two guards, who made use of the opportunity to trip me up on the stairs at the entrance. After arriving at what would be my domicile and \u201cworkplace\u201d for the next week, a man (who thankfully made only that one brief appearance) with a crazed expression and bulging, bloodshot eyes started screaming at me at the top of his lungs.\n\u201cDo you wanna die you fucking bastard? You son of a bitch \u2026 Coming into our country and committing all these crimes. You think Trump or Pompeo will save your sorry arse? Huh?\u201d\nThey asked me why I had come to their country. When I told them the truth \u2013 that I had a genuine interest in North Korean novels and wanted to do business there \u2013 I was told that it was \u201cunnatural\u201d that an Australian would harbour such motives, and that nobody would believe such logic. Their point was clear, we were the \u201cenemy\u201d.\nEvery day was spent writing forced confessions of my \u201ccrimes\u201d, which became only more fanciful as time went on. When I objected to their allegations, they began yelling at me, reminding me that I could face execution by firing squad if I didn\u2019t carry out my \u201creflection\u201d and do it \u201csincerely\u201d. The entire process was in my third foreign language, Korean.\nA typical \u201cself-criticism\u201d session went like this:\n\u201cAlek, you do realise that this is serious business, don\u2019t you? If you\u2019re lucky, you\u2019ll only get 10 years hard labour. We have a mountain of evidence on your crimes. You\u2019d better confess if you\u2019d like to be treated leniently.\u201d\n\u201cI have no idea what you\u2019re talking about. Honestly.\u201d\n\u201cAll right, let me show you an example.\u201d\nHe pulls out a picture of a North Korean toy tank with an anti-American slogan inscribed on it that I had uploaded onto Instagram.\n\u201cYou uploaded a photo of this toy tank onto the internet \u2026 That\u2019s military espionage!\u201d\n\u201cIs he being serious?\u201d I thought to myself as I tried to suppress a smile.\nWhen they finally released me, they made me read out a \u201cletter of apology\u201d (which they dictated to me), in which I confessed to \u201cthreatening world peace\u201d, \u201cinfringing upon the sovereignty of the DPRK\u201d, among other heinous acts. I was also forced to acknowledge that my human rights had been respected, an act which itself was a violation of those very rights.\nThey filmed this, threatening to release the footage if I ever \u201cslandered\u201d their country again. That, I actually wouldn\u2019t mind, other than for the fact that in the video I look a bit nervous. I was asked to sound \u201cmournful\u201d but I am a horrible actor and ended up reading the letter in monotone.\nI always knew that North Korea was that kind of a country, and that I was taking certain risks with what I was doing there. So in the end, I wasn\u2019t caught by surprise when I was detained, although I was caught a little off guard.\nPerhaps I found it hard to accept that this could ever happen to me, because over the years I had visited the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, as it is formally known, I had come to associate the place with the good people I met and came to know. Reservations about North Korea\u2019s political system aside, I had come to discover that most North Korean people were decent, honest, hard-working folk just like anywhere else.\nAt the university dormitory I lived alongside the specially trained and vetted local students, who were ostensibly there to teach us the Korean language and culture but in reality were spying on us. They were the only Korean students we were allowed to interact with.\nNorth Korea is one of the world\u2019s most xenophobic societies. I\u2019ve never heard of a single foreigner visiting the home of a North Korean friend, even among the Chinese students. It simply has never been allowed.\nBut this xenophobia comes from the state, not the people.\nOne day, one of the Chinese students in the dormitory was playing a hip hop track on her phone. A Korean student curled her lip in disgust and said \u201chip hop is degenerate music\u201d. But another one of the Korean students visited me before he was due to leave the dormitory. \u201cYou\u2019re always listening to music Alek, can you play some of it for me?\u201d\nI always used earphones not only because I didn\u2019t want to disturb them, but also because I didn\u2019t want to create any political trouble. But I accepted his request, and played him some tracks from the Californian virtuoso rock guitarist Buckethead, a favourite of mine.\n\u201cI can feel the han,\u201d he said, evoking a very Korean sentiment with no English equivalent that is variously translated as resentment, grief, or sorrow. Han is often said to express the bitterness of the Korean people towards their history of suffering under Japanese colonialism. It is considered uniquely beautiful when rendered in music.\n\u201cIf I practise, will I ever be able to become as good at guitar as he?\u201d\nI said yes, but in my heart I knew that while this country is kept in a state of hermetic isolation \u2013 a place where rock music and hip hop don\u2019t officially exist \u2013 that might be unlikely.\nAnd that\u2019s the \u201clesson\u201d I learned in all this, if there is one. The government, ruled as it is by military hardliners and a perpetually suspicious security force, may hate us for a long time to come. But, after 20 visits over a decade, I know that the people of North Korea want more openness and more engagement with the outside world.\nAs soon as I had read out the apology and been forgiven for my \u201ccrimes\u201d, a switch flipped inside \u201cteacher\u201d. We chatted about sport \u2013 he played in a soccer team \u2013 and family life \u2013 he had great expectations for his 11-year-old son. I told him of my undying affection for my wife.\nAnd when the investigation was officially over, he began acting like a normal human being, patting me on the back and making jokes. Call it Stockholm Syndrome, but I actually quite liked this man. The next day I was driven to the airport, accompanied by him and a few of his colleagues. This last ride was spent comparing the cost of rent in Australia and Japan, and talking about my plans for the future.\n\u201cAlek, you have a knack for writing, you should keep on doing it. Just make sure you say good things about our country in your future work and maybe we can meet again in Pyongyang one day.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll do my best,\u201d I said.\nWhen the others had left the car to sort out some procedures in the airport, I sat in the carpark alone with teacher. In the next half hour, I would board a flight to Beijing and be free.\n\u201cAlek, please remember for future\u2019s sake \u2013 we don\u2019t hate you personally, it\u2019s the crimes you\u2019ve committed that we despise.\u201d\nI remained silent, but I wanted to say that right back at him.\n* Alek Sigley is working on a book-length account of his three semesters as a foreign student at Kim Il-sung university and his nine days of North Korean secret police interrogation.\nNames and details of all North Koreans have been altered to protect their identities.",

The service, better known as the Purple House, runs dialysis clinics in 18 remote communities across a vast area of central Australia.\nPurple House staff have spent the past fortnight rushing to empty its Alice Springs clinic and send its mostly elderly patients out bush where it\u2019s safer, for now.\n\u201cOur isolation gives us a little more time to prepare than the big cities,\u201d Brown said this week. Aboriginal community-controlled health organisations were meeting almost every day by phone to compare notes, share resources and knowledge, she said.\nA public health campaign in dozens of Aboriginal languages is under way, including short videos with the theme \u201cstay on country, care for family\u201d.\nThe national taskforce of experts in Indigenous health and epidemiology who have been advising the national cabinet have released a detailed plan for when the storm arrives.\nIt is a grim list of challenging considerations:\nexpediting testing and reducing contagion by \u201cdriving samples to town rather than waiting for the weekly plane.\u201d\nusing tents in overcrowded communities for quarantine and isolation\ndeploying mobile respiratory clinics during outbreaks.\ndiscussing

say they are \u201cpreparing for death and suffering\u201d in Aboriginal and Islander communities, because they don\u2019t have the resources to evacuate very ill people.\nThe president of the Australian Medical Association, Dr Tony Bartone, has called for the national cabinet to \u201curgently fund and resource Aboriginal Torres Strait Islander health services to ensure they can respond to Covid-19\u201d.\nThe minister for Indigenous Australians, Ken Wyatt, and the health minister, Greg Hunt, have announced \u201cflexible\u201d funding to 45 organisations across 110 remote communities, to help Aboriginal medical services prepare by \u201cpromoting personal protective measures, including hand and respiratory hygiene, cough etiquette and use of respirators or face masks\u201d and even \u201cpurchasing soap for community and schools\u201d.\n\u201cOur number one priority is to save lives by slowing the spread of coronavirus and stop people bringing the virus into remote communities,\u201d Wyatt said.\nBut the suspension of non-essential medical treatments will increase pressure on the everyday health burden in Aboriginal communities, according to Western Australian ophthalmologist, Dr Angus Turner.\nTurner treats hundreds of people in remote communities, \u201cvery stressed patients at the moment\u201d, whose vision is impaired by macular degeneration, diabetes and other comorbidities.\n\u201cMy concern is that over the next six months we could be allowing peoples\u2019 vision to deteriorate, while we can\u2019t do the injection treatments that keep people seeing,\u201d Turner said.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t get to regions or move between regions, and it might not mean blindness over the next few months, but it\u2019s the difference between driving and not driving and that is a big issue for anyone, especially if you\u2019re in an outback area.\n\u201cSo if someone was just on the right side of the vision line before this, they may not be afterwards,\u201d he said.\nThe evacuation of at-risk patients to big city hospitals presents challenges too, according to the Australian Indigenous Doctors\u2019 Association.\nThe association said in a statement it had already received reports of \u201cabhorrent and unethical behaviour\u201d in hospitals, including staff at a Perth hospital who said \u201cAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people would get [Covid-19] because they don\u2019t wash their hands.\u201d\n\u201cSuch blatant racism can never be tolerated \u2013 least of all at this crucial time.\n\u201cAIDA fully appreciates that the Australian medical workforce is facing exceptional challenges right now.\n\u201cHowever, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples\u2019 lives, health and wellbeing cannot be put at risk because of underlying racism and prejudice,\u201d AIDA said.\nAn emergency specialist in Perth, Dr Nicole Liesis, said she had overhead such comments, and they were an example of her major concern.\n\u201cWhen I think of the impact of Covid-19 on the Aboriginal elder population, they are such a precious, fragile and irreplaceable resource, and they suffer a heavy burden of disease as well as trauma.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve already had so much loss and bereavement and it is inevitable there will be so much more in the week and months to come,\u201d Liesis said.\n\u201cIn WA the only critical care available to date is in Perth.\n\u201cI know current disaster planning involves setting up intensive care hubs in regional centres, which has never been done before, but there\u2019s long-standing reluctance among Aboriginal people to engage with healthcare and all the dismissiveness, judgement and stereotyping that goes with it.\u201d\nLiesis said Aboriginal people might prefer to stay home and \u201cdie on country\u201d than be flown to city hospitals, and health workers and families needed to prepare for that.\nField hospitals should be established \u201cbefore communities are critically unwell\u201d, she said.\n\u201cMany that I have spoken to are deeply saddened by the plight that faces Indigenous Australia, but it is not a time for pity or sympathy.\n\u201cI do not want our children to hear \u2018Oh it was so sad, but there was not much we could do for those people.\u2019 Those people are our people. The holders of cultural wisdom. A national treasure that must be preserved at all cost.\u201d\nAt the now quiet Purple House in Alice Springs, Brown urged non-Indigenous Australians to listen to the health authorities advice on Covid-19.\n\u201cWhat happens in the rest of the country affects us heavily,\u201d Brown said. \u201cPeople who can stay home, please stay home! Do it for yourselves, but do it for us too.\n\u201cThis virus knows no boundaries in terms of wealth, status, language or education. But for those less able to cope with its impact, it will be devastating.\u201d",

        "content": "Worried parents are increasingly pulling their children out of services amid the coronavirus crisis\nChildcare operators fear they will have to shut their doors and lay off staff without an urgent lifeline from the Australian government, as worried parents increasingly pull their children out of services.\nThe next national cabinet meeting on Friday is due to discuss the early childhood sector, but operators say the need is immediate and they have already had to retrench educators or reduce hours because of the steep decline in children\u2019s attendance amid the coronavirus crisis.\nMany in the sector have called for a change to the existing rules around fee charging. Currently, parents have to continue paying the \u201cgap\u201d between the childcare subsidy and the centre\u2019s fee, even during absences.\nThis situation is leading some families to cancel their enrolments altogether, meaning centres no longer receive the childcare subsidy that accounts for a large part of their revenue. That is putting the future viability of childcare centres at risk.\nMonique Atack, the director of Hunny Pots Early Learning Centre in Glenwood, New South Wales, said the centre usually had 56 children, but over the past two weeks an average of just 15 were attending each day. More than 10% of parents had cancelled their children\u2019s enrolment altogether, with that share growing by the day.\n\u201cWe made our first redundancy yesterday, which was heartbreaking. Being a family-owned business, our staff is our family,\u201d Atack said, adding that staff members had also had their hours reduced.\n\u201cThey [the government] have got to act and it\u2019s got to be immediate. If they don\u2019t, we\u2019re going to really suffer.\u201d\nEarly Childhood Australia, a peak body, estimates that across most of the nation, about 650 early childhood education and care services \u2013 or 4% \u2013 have already closed. While those figures largely comprise outside school hours care, it also includes some long day-care centres. The data collected so far do not include Tasmania and the Northern Territory.\nThe peak body\u2019s chief executive, Samantha Page, called on the government to continue to pay services the childcare subsidy based on enrolment numbers in the first week of March, before the steep drop in attendance.\nThe childcare subsidy accounted for about 60% of the revenue of childcare centres, Page said. She said the government should also waive the contribution required to be charged to parents when the children were absent.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that everybody could continue to be employed at the same hours, but it would certainly secure a good proportion of jobs,\u201d Page said.\nShe said this proposal would be a better support than the recently announced jobkeeper payment, because services may not reach the drop in turnover threshold. She did not want to see centres put in a position of potentially having to close \u2013 with their turnover therefore vanishing \u2013 in order to be eligible for the new wages subsidy of $1,500 per fortnight per worker.\nThe country\u2019s biggest childcare operator, Goodstart Early Learning, said its 665 centres remained open but were experiencing increasing numbers of absences. Goodstart told its 3,000 casual educators last week that it was no longer able to provide them with ongoing work.\nThe chief executive of Goodstart, Julia Davison, said many of these educators were \u201cextremely distressed\u201d and looking for assurances that the organisation would be able to provide assistance through the government\u2019s recently announced jobkeeper payment program. The group is seeking clarity from the government about its eligibility.\n\u201cGoodstart Early Learning urgently requires access to the jobkeeper scheme and a viability package to keep our centres open and retain our dedicated highly trained educators and teachers through the next six months in order to continue the essential support we provide for vulnerable children and essential services workers,\u201d Davison said.\nHelen Gibbons, the United Workers Union\u2019s director of early childhood education, said parents were un-enrolling their children from childcare to avoid having to pay the gap fee, which in turn was costing educators either their jobs or their normal rostered hours.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen in the first wave is all of the casuals losing their hours and a fairly significant part of the sector is staffed by casuals,\u201d Gibbons said. These developments were \u201ctragic\u201d. But changes to stop charging the gap fee could help \u201ckeep the centres alive\u201d.\nGibbons said educators had also been organising for centres to implement additional safety measures to avoid Covid-19 spreading, including temperature checks before children entered each day, as social distancing was impractical in these contexts.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t change a nappy from 1.5 metres away,\u201d she said.\nLast month the government made some changes, including increasing to 62 the number of days that a childcare service would continue to receive the childcare subsidy when a child was absent from care. It has also pointed to a grants scheme for special circumstances.\nHowever, Labor\u2019s early childhood education spokesperson, Amanda Rishworth, said the government needed to announce a more comprehensive solution right away.\n\u201cThere\u2019s already a direct relationship between the centres and the government. The government is already paying them a subsidy. Make it as simple as possible: pay the subsidy and keep them open.\u201d\nFederal, state and territory education ministers are considering regulatory, funding and viability measures. An announcement is expected after the national cabinet of leaders meets on Friday.",

        "content": "The lifeblood of Australian sport is suffering in silence, waiting for word from above and fearful of the future\nRead the daily sport headlines \u2013 or at least those that exist in this time of competitive dormancy \u2013 and one could be excused for thinking the only athletes affected by the coronavirus-induced halt to activity are professionals.\nWhat of those, though, who play sport not for a living but for recreation? What of the children of Australia who populate suburban mini-fields each weekend to kick a ball with their friends? These are the millions of participants who not only form the grassroots sport collective but in many cases, as people who pay to play, are a vital source of funding for the upper echelon to which they aspire.\nAt the big end of town, governing bodies are busying themselves with the big issues: salvaging seasons, player payments, cost-cutting and more. At the other end of the spectrum, however, the lifeblood of Australian sport is suffering in silence, waiting for word from above and fearful of times to come. Government, meanwhile, has more on its mind than sport.\n\u201cI know there\u2019s a lot going on out there and I doubt community sport is a priority at the moment,\u201d Matthew Winters, president of Virginia United Football Club in Brisbane\u2019s north, tells Guardian Australia. \u201cOur minister for sport in Queensland is also the minister for housing. His focus, and nor should it be, won\u2019t be on community sport at this time.\u201d\nCommunity sport clubs around the nation are run on shoestring budgets and facilitated almost exclusively by volunteers. Their funding model revolves around the key driver of player registrations, propped up programs, fundraising events and the ubiquitous canteen. But a time of no sport also means a time of no money.\n\u201cThe annual registration fees aren\u2019t enough to cover the costs that we incur,\u201d Winters says. \u201cWe are very reliant on school camps and canteen. Sausage sizzles make a fantastic amount of money which is essential for a club to operate. We\u2019re just not making that money now. But we still have ongoing costs. We still have to maintain the fields. We have to pay water bills.\u201d\nWith winter sports in abeyance but facing the possibility of total wipeout in 2020, the issue of registrations has become problematic. Most players are already paid up, presenting clubs with the dilemma of what to do in the event of a drastically reduced season or one that does not start at all. The governance and distribution of these registrations differ from sport to sport but in football everyone gets, and needs, a piece of the pie.\n\u201cIf all competitions were cancelled I believe a full refund would be disastrous for St George FA, Football NSW and Football Federation Australia, unless they received emergency funding from the federal government,\u201d says Jeremy Babb, president of All Saints Oatley West Football Club in Sydney\u2019s south.\n\u201cParents and members are going to ask for their registration money back. This will mean teams fold and larger amounts of people subsequently ask for refunds. This in turn will impact the associations, who all rely on registration income to supplement their bottom line and give them the ability to operate. Without members and children playing sport, the associations can\u2019t survive.\n\u201cAt this stage we are following the government\u2019s directions down to Football NSW and looking at a shorter season. If it goes past the current May start date it may be a cancelled season with no games played, which would indicate all members of all associations should get a full refund.\u201d\nLast week, clubs across the state refused to forward registration fees to Football NSW after its 24 regional associations were invoiced by the governing body. Bill Owen, the association subcommittee chair, says: \u201cHow does taking money off mum and dad and giving them nothing for it get those people to come back next year? By charging them something and not giving them anything you are just adding to their financial stress. I think that\u2019s pretty awful.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a common plight, with Winters experiencing the same grievance in Queensland. \u201cWe\u2019re affiliated with Football Brisbane and they\u2019re still issuing invoices to us,\u201d he says. \u201cIf the authorities have suspended the season, why haven\u2019t these invoices been suspended? We\u2019re getting emails from people saying me and my partner just lost our jobs. How can you not do a refund there?\u201d\nCommunity sport will survive the coronavirus pandemic. But in what form and in what health? The prospect of some clubs folding is a real one. \u201cIf there isn\u2019t any help, and I get there are other priorities, lots of clubs will go down,\u201d Winters says. \u201cIf clubs are forced to refund their members now after the costs they\u2019ve incurred, there won\u2019t be any money left to pay for upcoming costs and a large number of clubs will have no choice other than to close their doors for good. If clubs do go under, how do you get them going again?\u201d\nJust how much help community clubs need to survive this crisis will vary. Adding to the anxiety of those at the coalface is a lack of certainty from where, if at all, assistance will come. \u201cNo money comes down from the FFA,\u201d Winters says. \u201cThey\u2019re not talking about grassroots football; they\u2019re talking about their own survival and seem to be focusing at a bigger level and not really grassroots.\u201d\nIn time, these discussions will come and the outlook for community clubs will become clearer. For now, though, grassroots sport is in the same boat as the rest of us. For now, all we have is hope. \u201cI think the strong community spirit will ultimately put grassroots sport back on the playing fields,\u201d Babb says. \u201cAnd I hope we will come out the other side as a more committed and involved sporting base with little or no damage to our games.\u201d\nFootball Federation Australia was approached for comment",

Commercial landlords and tenants, in particular, would be expected to \u201cshare the pain\u201d, he said.\nOn residential tenancies, Sukkar said the moratorium \u201cdoes \u2026 not absolve people of their responsibility to pay their rent\u201d.\n\u201cUnless you\u2019ve got an arrangement with your landlord that takes into account your financial circumstances, you are required to pay your rent.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve strengthened the safety net to ensure people are able to meet the essential costs of day-to-day life.\u201d\nSukkar said the moratorium on evictions was designed to ensure people were not left \u201cwithout a home at this very, very difficult time\u201d.\n\u201cBut at the same time we have to be sensitive to the financial realities for landlords who have repayments that they have to make and rely on the income stream from those properties in order to meet those repayments.\u201d\nOn Wednesday O\u2019Neil wrote to the president of the REIA, Adrian Kelly, complaining that residential tenants had received \u201cthreatening correspondence from their real estate agents regarding the payment of rent and notice around evictions\u201d.\nIn one email seen by Guardian Australia, which unions believe is typical of correspondence to property managers, agents are advised to tell tenants they must \u201ccontinue to pay your rent in full and on time\u201d and to recommend they seek relief payments from Centrelink or consider early access to superannuation.\nAs part of the second tranche of Covid-19 economic support, the government granted early access to superannuation for those experiencing financial hardship, allowing one withdrawal of $10,000 this financial year, and the same next year.\n\u201cAustralian unions have been notified by their members of the intransigence of some landlords and real estate agents to broker a temporary rent freeze or reduction through this crisis, or unhelpful and unsolicited financial advice from real estate agents about withdrawing from their superannuation or their presumed eligibility for Jobseeker payments,\u201d O\u2019Neil wrote.\nO\u2019Neil called on the institute to \u201cdesist from providing financial advice to tenants\u201d and suggested that instead it consider temporary rent freezes and alert their tenants and landlords to the \u201clandlords\u2019 ability to access temporary mortgage relief through nearly every bank\u201d.\nIn response to the letter, Kelly told Guardian Australia: \u201cThe priority for our people at the moment is looking after our tenants and property owners, in particular those that have lost employment.\u201d\nKelly suggested the ACTU should help \u201c[its] own members in achieving practical outcomes for everyone instead of writing letters making scurrilous claims\u201d.\nOn Sunday the national cabinet agreed to a set of principles on commercial tenancies, including that \u201ccommercial property owners should ensure that any benefits received in respect of their properties should also benefit their tenants in proportion to the economic impact caused by coronavirus\u201d.\nIt said national cabinet would aim for \u201ccost-sharing or deferral of losses between landlords and tenants, with commonwealth, state and territory governments, local government and financial institutions to consider mechanisms to provide assistance\u201d.\nOn Tuesday the Shopping Centre Council of Australia reached a joint position with the two peak retail bodies and the Pharmacy Guild, agreeing that tenants and landlords should agree to \u201ctemporary rent assistance\u201d on case-by-case basis.",

The airline also had plans before the coronavirus to expand at London Heathrow.\nIn one of the letters, according to Sky News, John Harrison, the general counsel and UK chairman of Airbus, said that Virgin\u2019s \u201ccollapse could have an extremely negative impact on the A330 programme\u201d.\nHe added: \u201cAs you will be aware, all wings for these aircraft are designed and manufactured in the UK, and orders from airlines like Virgin are vital for the continuation of our business.\u201d\nRolls-Royce has also stressed the \u201csignificant importance\u201d of Virgin\u2019s custom to the company and its UK supply chain.\nA Heathrow spokesperson confirmed that the airport had written on Virgin\u2019s behalf, and said: \u201cThe government must take urgent steps now to safeguard the future of the sector or it will risk undermining the recovery of Britain\u2019s economy once we beat the virus.\u201d\nVirgin has parked up to 85% of its aircraft fleet and put most staff on eight weeks\u2019 unpaid leave, as well as cutting executive pay, and offering redundancy and year-long sabbaticals to its 8,500 employees. The carrier is 51% owned by Branson\u2019s Virgin Group, with a 49% stake held by the US carrier Delta Airlines. The US airline industry has already received a multibillion-dollar bailout as part of an economic stimulus package passed by Congress.\nVirgin Atlantic\u2019s chairman, Peter Norris, led calls last month for the government to give the industry up to \u00a37.5bn in state support. However, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, last week disappointed airlines and airports by deciding against an industry-wide bailout, but said help would be considered on a case-by-case basis.\nVirgin submitted its claim for state assistance this week to Rothschild, the investment bank which is acting for the government to assess bailout requests from aviation businesses.\nHow much leverage Virgin\u2019s industry backers have in Downing Street is questionable. Airbus was one of the most prominent industrial voices against Brexit, while Heathrow\u2019s expansion plans have been left to evaporate by the government after a judicial review.\nThe government is also loth to be seen to be helping out billionaire shareholders. Branson has said he will inject $250m (\u00a3200m) into his Virgin Group, which includes other businesses as well as the airline. EasyJet, another major UK airline which could eventually require aid, went ahead with a \u00a3171m dividend payout this month, which it said it was legally obliged to do.\nThe regional carrier Loganair, which stepped in to take over some of Flybe\u2019s routes when it collapsed at the start of the coronavirus outbreak, is also expected to seek help.\nHelp for Virgin would also be resisted by its bigger rival at Heathrow, British Airways, as well as environmental groups. Willie Walsh, the boss of BA\u2019s owner, IAG, has said that \u201cgovernments would expect airlines to look at self-help before they would call [for] state aid\u201d.\nVirgin Atlantic\u2019s financial performance had been improving in recent years, cutting losses to \u00a326m in 2018, the last full-year results the airline issued Its Virgin Holidays arm turned a slight \u00a36m profit. The airline reported cash reserves of \u00a3489m a little under a year ago, and had since unveiled ambitious expansion plans to challenge BA\u2019s dominance at Heathrow.\nHowever, it is believed to have made significant additional losses in the ill-fated acquisition of Flybe, which \u2013 as part of a consortium \u2013 it hoped to rebrand as Virgin Connect, to feed passengers into its long-haul network. It owned 30% of the failed business and shareholders were said to have injected up to \u00a3100m into the business before Flybe\u2019s collapse.",

The most sought-after is a FFP3 mask, with the highest safety levels, but they are in short supply globally.\nThe World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.\nThe UN agency\u00a0advises\u00a0people to:\nMany countries are now enforcing or recommending curfews or lockdowns. Check with your local authorities for up-to-date information about the situation in your area.\u00a0\nIn the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should\u00a0stay at home for at least 7 days.\nIf you live with other people,\u00a0they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.\nThe anaesthetist said that while his department had not yet run out of equipment, they were devising improvised models in anticipation of a rise in patients. He said there was no official guidance for the use of snorkels but Italian doctors had shown it was possible.\n\u201cThe snorkel masks have been adapted for use as non-invasive ventilators by Italian anaesthetists. They published their design including 3D-printed adapters to connect oxygen tubing to the snorkel breathing tube,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThis adapted connection can alternatively be used to attach a heat moisture exchanging (HME) filter used worldwide to protect tubing and ventilators from patients\u2019 exhaled gases. These HMEs are in plentiful supply. You now have PPE combining a full-face visor with filtered air, cleanable, reusable and resource-efficient.\u201d\nAt one practice in Devon, a patient has been using a 3D printer to make masks for doctors. \u201cWe have not been issued with sufficient kit, so a patient has been making it. That should not be the case,\u201d the practice manager said.\n\u201cHe just prints using a 3D printer. He has taken it up a scale and is now providing a number of hospitals. It is a full-face visor on a plastic headband and it goes around the head, protecting the whole front of the face,\u201d the manager said.\nAnother doctor said something similar was happening at their trust as 3D printing partners worked to help adapt snorkels. \u201cI think our hospital has plenty of PPE. We have just been tinkering as a proof of concept in the scenario we run out,\u201d they said.\nElsewhere, doctors have raised concerns about ill-fitting masks. One said: \u201cWe have only this week started being fit-tested for FFP3 masks. This is supposed to be a requirement. Usually only one type will actually fit. This means there\u2019s been around two to three weeks minimum that staff have been dealing with possible Covid-19 patients without fitting masks because we weren\u2019t fit-tested.\n\u201cToday I was informed by one of our healthcare staff that we have around 60-70 masks left. That\u2019s it. When I asked a senior what happened after that, they couldn\u2019t tell me. I don\u2019t blame them. They\u2019re doing the best they can just like the rest of us. We are all risking our lives because our government covered up reports that said we were woefully underprepared for a pandemic years ago. We are using eye protection now that\u2019s been donated by schools and DIY shops. That\u2019s pathetic.\u201d\nThe Guardian has previously reported that schools across England were being asked to donate science goggles to the NHS.\nMeanwhile, the public is being urged to stop panic-buying breathing aids during the outbreak. Intus Healthcare, which specialises in sleep disorders and sells continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machines to help with breathing, said there had been a huge increase in people trying to buy its products.\n\u201cUnfortunately, a lot of people are buying them out of panic rather than medical necessity, due to the news about ventilator shortages. We are being overwhelmed by these additional orders and are finding it difficult to help those with genuine medical conditions,\u201d said Tim Barker, of Intus Healthcare.\nHe added: \u201cIt is vital that people understand that CPAP machines, ventilators, are medical devices and cannot be supplied unless authorised by a medical professional. They should not be being purchased \u2018just in case\u2019 without any formal diagnosis of a relevant medical condition. The orders cannot be fulfilled and they delay other, valid orders.\u201d\nAn NHS spokesperson said: \u201cThe Department of Health and Social Care\n has secured millions more items of personal protective equipment for\n us, which the army is helping get to frontline staff across the NHS\n with every hospital and ambulance trust, family doctors and community\n pharmacy having received a delivery.\n \u201cThe personal protective equipment sent out to NHS staff is certified\n by HSE as safe and appropriate.\u201d",

        "content": "City\u2019s statistics look bad, but there are reasons why people should not be unduly worried\nFor residents of Sheffield, the daily roll call of coronavirus cases has made for alarming reading. On Wednesday the Steel City had the fourth highest number in any local authority in England (541), behind Surrey (571), Hampshire (652) and Birmingham (734).\nThe figures have led some to worry that Sheffield \u2013 home to 575,400 people, compared with Birmingham\u2019s 1.1 million \u2013 has become a hotbed of disease. Research from the Centre for Cities on Tuesday prompted further consternation by breaking the data down by population size and reporting that Sheffield was second only to London in terms of cases per 100,000 people.\nBut local hospitals and public health experts are playing down the statistics. \u201cThe figures are misleading and alarming. People look at them and think, \u2018Oh gosh, we\u2019re all going to get it\u2019 and \u2018Sheffield is a high-risk area\u2019, but that\u2019s not true,\u201d said Dr Andrew Lee, a reader of global public health at Sheffield University and executive director of primary care and population health at NHS Vale of York clinical commissioning group.\nSo far, 21 patients have died in hospitals in Sheffield, while the Sheffield Teaching Hospitals trust, which operates the city\u2019s two big hospitals, the Northern General and the Royal Hallamshire, says they are currently treating \u201ca comparatively low level\u201d of coronavirus patients.\nTalking in his academic capacity, Lee despaired at the Public Health England daily dashboard, which lists the number of cases in each local authority in England. \u201cThat tracker is really misleading. In some senses they should just turn it off because everywhere is testing differently. So you can\u2019t compare place A with place B with place C. And it\u2019s not like you\u2019re just following a score because the interpretation of those numbers is really complicated,\u201d he said.\nThe main reason Sheffield has such a high number of cases is that it has been testing more people and testing earlier, according to Lee. The Sheffield Teaching Hospitals trust took the decision to test all symptomatic NHS workers 11 days before most other areas, the Guardian understands.\nFrom 19 March, any Northern General staff with symptoms were instructed to phone occupational health and \u2013 assuming they had their own transport and weren\u2019t going to use public transport \u2013 were given an appointment for a test, according to a medic from the Northern General. That hospital has a larger than average in-house testing laboratory, which when it opened in 2013 was able to process more than 10m tests a year. And at the start of March, local authorities set up a temporary drive-through community testing facility just off the Sheffield Parkway where members of the public who had visited affected countries could be tested without leaving their cars.\nIt was only this week that the rest of the NHS was ordered by Sir Simon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England, to start testing staff, starting with those working in critical care, emergency departments and ambulance services.\nHealthcare workers were disproportionately likely to get infected, said Lee. \u201cIf you look at what happened with Mers-Covid, when they had that big outbreak in South Korea some years ago, most of the cases were in health workers. And the same with Sars in 2003-4. It just reflects the fact healthcare workers have high-risk, prolonged contacts with patients. Healthcare workers are not representative of the wider public.\u201d\nThe Northern General medic said the widespread testing in Sheffield meant that infected staff stayed at home while those who tested negative could come in to work. \u201cI know five or six people in my team were sure they had it and tested negative, and yet a few others who were adamant it was just a cold turned out to have coronavirus,\u201d they said.\nAnother reason for Sheffield\u2019s high figures is that the Royal Hallamshire is home to one of England\u2019s few specialist NHS infection centres. That is why, when the first coronavirus patients arrived in the UK from the cruise ship the Diamond Princess, two were sent there.\nIn addition, Sheffield has experienced a few \u201cCovid clusters\u201d, according to a spokeswoman at the hospitals trust. \u201cI know we did have some clusters of people that we tested in the community, which had a wide contract testing base, which made the Sheffield figures look larger,\u201d she said. These clusters were largely groups returning from Italy and other infected regions, she added.\nShe said the trust saw two million patients each year \u2013 four times the population of Sheffield \u2013 but that they were not currently treating many Covid-19 patients.\n\u201dThe number of patients fluctuates each day, but we are at a comparatively low level at present. We currently have capacity in our ITU [intensive treatment unit] and HDU [high dependency unit] and have plans in place to increase capacity as the number of cases rise,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit like watching the tide go out before the tsunami comes in,\u201d said the Northern General medic. \u201cWe are not overwhelmed yet, but we have all seen what has happened in London and we know what\u2019s coming. We are hoping the lockdown will make it not as bad, but it depends who you talk to how much you believe whether we are going to be saved or not.\u201d",

        "content": "Prominent British Muslim journalist and activist whose voice was heard from Downing Street to Dakar\nFuad Nahdi, who has died aged 62 due to complications related to diabetes, was one of the most important figures over the past 30 years in the framing, development and mainstream influence of British Islam. He also made Britain a bridgehead between east and west, where Islamic scholars came to face their reckoning with modernity.\nNahdi held no great administrative office but he was a consummate communicator with crucial connections when it mattered \u2013 which was the moment when British Islam emerged as distinct from \u201cAsianness\u201d, through the Rushdie Affair, 9/11, the Iraq war and the 2005 London bombings.\nHe also lived in the right place at the right time, for Britain, hosting the world\u2019s most ethnically and theologically diverse Muslim population, became an international centre for debate, providing a more rigorous testing ground than Muslim-majority, often authoritarian, states.\nA warm, charming man, widely trusted as a writer and publisher, interfaith leader and community activist, he had unrivalled connections not only in the Arab world and Africa but, unusually for a Muslim, within the liberal establishments of Europe and the US.\nHis rare cultural, religious and political agility, combined with an irreverent sense of humour, meant his voice was heard from Downing Street to Dakar, from Manchester to Mecca. He was well equipped to explain Islam \u2013 and in particular its British version \u2013 to establishment figures and became, in 2014, the first Muslim to address the General Synod of the Church of England.\nTwo of his innovations stand out. First, in the late 1980s and early 90s he founded two independent, often satirical and humorous Muslim publications \u2013 MuslimWise and Q-News \u2013 which provided an intellectual and spiritual home where the UK\u2019s multi-ethnic, linguistically diverse Muslims could forge a confident, dissenting identity that nurtured resilience against political exclusion and calls to violence. Prior to this, virtually all Muslim media in Britain was funded from overseas \u2013 Saudi Arabia, Iran or the Gulf states \u2013 and largely reflected the interests of other countries.\nSecond, after the London bombings he took his message out to Britain\u2019s communities by founding Radical Middle Way, a community interest company that delivered programmes and events promoting the idea that good religion is the way to tackle extremism. Radical Middle Way hosted hip-hop concerts across Britain, attended by thousands of young Muslims, in the midst of which a devout Sufi scholar, usually from abroad, in traditional dress, would take the stage with messages of faith and peace, followed by questions and discussion.\nQuick to spot extremism\u2019s harnessing of technologies to spread misinformation, Nahdi ensured that all these events were widely streamed on the internet. Working also in Sudan, Mali, Morocco, Pakistan and Indonesia, Radical Middle Way galvanised a global Muslim conversation.\nNahdi\u2019s message was clearly expressed in the strapline for the Radical Middle Way initiative, which reads: Fight Fear. Fight Ignorance. Have Faith. A fierce critic of both Islamist violence and the Iraq war, he would say: \u201cThe problem is not too much religion. The problem is too little good religion.\u201d He would poke fun at out-of-touch imams and enjoyed rattling Islamic institutions. \u201cBeyond beards, scarves and halal meat, what does it mean to be a British Muslim?\u2019 asked an early edition of Q-News.\nIn 2001, a few days after the World Trade Center bombing, Nahdi anticipated problems that would later beset Britain, telling the Guardian: \u201cThe danger is that there are a large number of Muslim leaders in Britain who come from the same school of Islam as the Taliban. They are not extremists, but they copy the style. In Leicester, for example, they won\u2019t allow the women into the mosques.\n\u201cMeanwhile, there are platoons of young Muslims roaming the streets. They saw the TV images of the intifada and copied them during the Oldham riots. Now they are seeing Osama bin Laden turned by the BBC and others into a glamorous, Rambo figure. Next time, will they be copying the bombers? We have to invest in forging a positive identity for them so we create the right kind of Muslim. Otherwise it could be dangerous for everyone.\u201d\nThe content of his publications encapsulated the confusing influences on British Muslims. One page might feature an entreaty from the Grand Ayatollah of Iran, the next an item on Yasmeen Ghauri, the Muslim supermodel, and another on the rise of HIV in the Muslim community.\nMuslimWise, a monthly satirical magazine modelled on Private Eye, was founded in 1988 amid the heated reaction to Salman Rushdie\u2019s novel The Satanic Verses. Q-News followed in 1992, a weekly independent newspaper investigating daily life \u2013 from dodgy halal certification to racist attacks, domestic violence, youth and women\u2019s projects and corruption in the nascent class of Muslim politicians.\nWith a female editor, Shagufta Yaqub, and news editor, Fareena Alam, its pages might juxtapose an article on sacred odes with a review of the latest Terminator film. Both publications were in print and did not survive far into the internet age, especially as Nahdi began to turn his attentions to the Radical Middle Way project. But they were influential projects with clout.\nNahdi\u2019s upbringing, and life in Britain, prepared him for cultural connectedness. Fluent in Arabic, English and Swahili, he was born in Arusha, Tanzania, to an Indonesian mother, Alya Faraj bin Muhanna Nahdi, and a Yemeni-Kenyan father, Salim Abdallah bin Taher Nahdi, who was a trader. His paternal heritage was in Hadramaut, the Yemeni home of the Bin Laden clan, which enabled him to observe that \u201cI\u2019m probably the only person who has had lunch with Tony Blair and dinner with Osama bin Laden.\u201d\nThe family settled in Mombasa, Kenya, and he attended the University of Nairobi, where he studied economics. He was arrested after playing a prominent role in student protests against the country\u2019s then president, Daniel arap Moi.\nIn 1983 he took a master\u2019s degree in Islamic studies at SOAS University of London and trained as a journalist at City University, guided by Godfrey Hodgson, the veteran Observer foreign correspondent. Hodgson connected him to Reuters and the US and British liberal media, for whom he wrote throughout his career.\nSoon after joining the political monthly Africa Events, Nahdi began what became a lifelong, daily conversation with its then editor, the late Zanzibari intellectual and former BBC journalist, Mohamed Mlamali Adam, who rooted the young journalist in an influential British circle of Islamic thinkers.\nNahdi also became a protege of Zaki Badawi, who built British Islam\u2019s key institutions, including the Muslim College and the Sharia Council, and who sought to shape an Islamic identity that could be comfortable for a minority community in a western context. Nahdi eventually saw the opportunity to take Badawi\u2019s insights on to bigger, more popular platforms.\nIn 1989 he married Humera Khan, a leading figure in British Muslim community development. Her Pakistani heritage, London upbringing and welcoming family embedded Nahdi in British life and ensured that their home became the go-to place for Muslim thinkers.\nNahdi\u2019s friendship with Rowan Williams, archbishop of Canterbury from 2002 to 2012, led to his 2014 Synod invitation. His address there anticipated the thinking that preoccupied his final years \u2013 that faiths should embrace convergence not conversion, helping people to be ethical and moral beings in a broken world.\n\u201cOur interdependent existence must be at the back of our minds at all times,\u201d he declared. \u201cSoon, two out of every three members of the church will have a Muslim neighbour. The need to educate our flocks on the proprieties of co-existence and the embracing of difference is a top priority.\u201d\nHe is survived by Humera, a son, Nadir, and a daughter, Ilyeh.\n Fuad Salim Abdullah Neheid Taher Nahdi, journalist and publisher, born 1 June 1957; died 21 March 2020",

He warned, though, that it would be \u201cunforgivable to assume this was a definitive defeat\u201d of Covid-19 and it would be \u201ca long battle\u201d.\nItaly\u2019s civil protection authority announced on Wednesday that the country\u2019s tally \u2013 already the highest in the world \u2013 had climbed by 727 deaths to 13,155, and that the number of confirmed infections, including deaths, recovered and current cases, had risen by 4,782, taking the total to 110,574.\nBut the daily rise in the number of deaths was sharply down on Tuesday\u2019s figure of 837, and the 2,937 new active cases represented an increase of 3.8% \u2013 more than the previous day, but confirming a declining trend. Two weeks ago, infections were rising at between three and four times that rate.\n\u201cThe curve tells us that we\u2019re at a plateau,\u201d Silvio Brusaferro, the president of Italy\u2019s Higher Health Institute (ISS), said earlier on Wednesday. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019ve hit the peak and that it\u2019s over, but that we must start the descent \u2026 by applying the measures in force.\u201d\nAccording to the Johns Hopkins University tracker, the pandemic has infected more than 870,000 people worldwide and killed more than 43,000. Nearly half the world\u2019s population are living under some form of requested or mandatory confinement.\nWhile China, where the outbreak originated, continues to report almost no domestic transmissions, a US intelligence report to the White House suggested Beijing was underreporting the numbers of both total cases and deaths the country has suffered.\nThree unnamed security officials told Bloomberg the secret report alleged that China\u2019s reporting of virus data was intentionally incomplete, and two of them said the report concluded that China\u2019s numbers were fake. Deborah Birx, the state department immunologist advising the White House, said on Tuesday she thought that \u201cprobably we were missing a significant amount of the data, now that what we see happened to Italy and see what happened to Spain\u201d.\nSpain, which crossed the threshold of 100,000 confirmed cases on Wednesday and reported another record single-day death toll of 864, is now following a similar pattern to Italy, with officials saying on Wednesday they were starting to see a \u201ctrend change\u201d. The two countries have the highest global death tolls in the pandemic.\nBetween 15 and 25 March, new cases in Spain were growing at a rate of 20% a day. From 25 March, that rate dropped to 12% and lower. Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Sierra of Spain\u2019s centre for health emergencies said the latest figures indicated the increase in new cases was continuing to level out.\n\u201cGenerally speaking, we can say that yesterday\u2019s rise in cases, which was around 8%, tells us that we\u2019re carrying on in the stabilisation phase of the pandemic,\u201d Sierra told a press conference.\nIn the US, meanwhile, deaths from the coronavirus topped 1,000 in New York City as authorities warned that the worst was yet to come, while Florida officials were locked in a standoff with two cruise ships steaming toward the coast.\nIn California, the number of people being taken to hospital nearly doubled over the past four days and the number of intensive care patients tripled. US deaths, which have exceeded those in China, could reach 240,000, according to the White House, with Donald Trump warning the country should expect a \u201cvery, very painful two weeks\u201d.\nIn other developments:\nFrance reported 509 deaths on Wednesday, its highest daily number since the epidemic began, bringing the toll to 4,032. The number of confirmed cases rose by 4,861 to 56,989.\nA specially adapted TGV train evacuated 36 patients from Paris to Brittany. France has 5,565 coronavirus patients in intensive care and greater Paris is nearing capacity.\nSouth Korea has received requests from 121 countries for help with coronavirus testing, its foreign ministry said.\nThe heads of three global agencies warned of the risk of a worldwide food shortage if authorities failed to manage the crisis properly.\nVladimir Putin is handling duties remotely after meeting a doctor who has since been diagnosed with the virus as Moscow rolled out an app and scannable barcodes to check whether people were obeying isolation rules.\nSaudi Arabia urged Muslims to wait before making hajj plans until there is more clarity about the pandemic.\nJapan, which reported 2,200 confirmed cases and 66 deaths, remains on the brink of a state of emergency as the rate of infections rises, officials said.\nThe death toll in Iran has reached 3,036, with 47,593 confirmed infections.\nAs equipment shortages continue to hamper Europe\u2019s response to the pandemic, France, which on Tuesday announced 499 new deaths, its biggest increase since the start of the pandemic, said it would invest \u20ac4bn (\u00a33.5bn) in \u201cstrategic\u201d health products including masks and respirators, with the aim of making the country \u201cfully and completely self-sufficient\u201d by the end of this year.\n\u201cWe have to produce in France, on our territory, from now on,\u201d said the president, Emmanuel Macron. \u201cCertain products and certain materials have a strategic importance and we need Europe to be independent to reduce our dependence. The day after the epidemic will not be like the day before; we must rebuild our national and European sovereignty.\u201d\nGermany\u2019s chancellor, Angela Merkel, said physical distancing measures would be maintained until 19 April and re-evaluated after Easter. Speaking after a telephone conference with the premiers of Germany\u2019s 16 states, which have registered 71,000 cases and 775 deaths, Merkel said it was too soon to talk about easing them.\nThe chancellor\u2019s caution comes amid a growing sense that the relatively stable situation in German hospitals could be about to become a lot more serious as the virus moves on to the elderly population.

The union, however, is first waiting on financial proposals from the 18 first-class counties this week before making any hard decisions.\nTom Harrison, the ECB chief executive, has stated a pay cut will not be sought from England\u2019s centrally contracted players \u2013 legally it appears this cannot be enforced \u2013 but it is clear the governing body is hoping a voluntary reduction will emerge from the dressing room.\nHarrison has taken a 25% cut to his \u00a3719,000 salary, 24 hours after announcing a \u00a361m short-term rescue package for cricket, while ECB staff are subject to two-month reductions ranging to 10 to 20% or have been furloughed under the government\u2019s job retention scheme.\nWith a number of counties doing the same, England players run the risk of appearing out of touch with the general mood but Morgan insists it is simply a case of wanting to establish how much of the summer\u2019s revenue-driving cricket will be lost.\n\u201cWe are open to helping in whatever way possible,\u201d said Morgan, England\u2019s World Cup-winning white-ball captain, via a conference call on Wednesday. \u201cWe want to hopefully make an impact.\n\u201cI\u2019m extremely willing to help where I know it will make a difference. No one seems to have any answers on the actual impact it will have on international cricket, English cricket, county cricket [but] I\u2019m open to absolutely everything. I\u2019m aware of how serious the situation is and aware how everyone will be affected from top to toe within the game and every sport.\u201d\nAs things stand no county matches will be staged before 28 May and the three-Test series against West Indies that starts on 4 June looks in jeopardy. The cost of cancelling the entire season is estimated to be \u00a3300m.\nThe Guardian has spoken to other England players who say they too are not blind to the situation faced by the sport \u2013 or the country as a whole \u2013 and are open, in principle, to taking a cut or deferral for the greater good.\nAs well as wanting to know more about how this money would directly benefit others, the players are mindful of needing to establish the mechanics of any pay cut in an equitable way, given their incomes vary by format and are a combination of retainer, salary, match fees and bonuses.\nThere are 16 centrally contracted England players, six of whom hold deals for red- and white-ball cricket. Each earns a retainer of around \u00a375,000 and then a salary on top depending on format. Test cricketers earn between \u00a3300k and \u00a3500k and one-day players between \u00a3200k and \u00a3300k.\nA single Test appearance earns a player \u00a314,000 and a white-ball game is worth up to \u00a35,000. It means a Test cricketer stands to lose \u00a384,000 in match fees \u2013 on top of any possible salary reduction \u2013 should all six matches against West Indies and Pakistan this summer be cancelled.\nWhile central contracts are negotiated through the England Player Partnership, there is also a reluctance among the England players to make a public move until the PCA has established terms for the 450-strong county workforce.\nMorgan, though coy when discussing money matters, was open to the notion of England\u2019s Test and white-ball teams playing concurrently should this be needed to deal with a fixture pile-up at the end of a truncated season.\nThe 33-year-old, who became a father three weeks ago, was also happy to commit to the idea of playing international cricket behind closed doors in what Harrison labelled \u201cbio-safe\u201d conditions.\nAsked about the loss of atmosphere with no crowd, Morgan replied: \u201cI\u2019ve played county cricket for a long time and Test cricket in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, and that\u2019s the exact same. But from a very serious point of view, if medical experts advised us it was OK to play behind closed doors and it was on TV, I think that would be a huge step forward for the game.\u201d",

        "content": "Feline transmission to humans not shown but infected pet owners warned to be careful\nCat owners may wish to be more cautious about contact with their pets, as a study from China has revealed Covid-19 can be transmitted between cats.\nThe team, at Harbin Veterinary Research Institute in China, found that cats are highly susceptible to Covid-19 and appear to be able to transmit the virus through respiratory droplets to other cats. Dogs, chickens, pigs and ducks were found to be unlikely to catch the infection, however.\nThe findings followed recent reports of a pet cat in Belgium being infected with Covid-19. About a week after the cat\u2019s owner started showing symptoms, the cat also developed breathing difficulties, diarrhoea and vomiting, and subsequent tests by vets at the University of Li\u00e8ge showed the animal was infected with coronavirus.\nThe lab experiments from the Chinese team involved a small number of animals that were given a high dose of the virus and there is no direct evidence that cats would also be able to infect people. However, the team behind the work said their findings provided important insights into the animal reservoirs of Covid-19 and how animal management might have a role in the control of the pandemic.\n\u201cSurveillance for Sars-CoV-2 in cats should be considered as an adjunct to elimination of of Covid-19 in humans,\u201d the paper concluded.\nThe work, which is not yet peer-reviewed, was uploaded to the preprint website bioRxiv on Wednesday. In the study, five cats were inoculated with coronavirus. Three of the animals were placed in cages next to cats that had not been given the virus, and one of the exposed cats also became infected, suggesting that transmission occurred through respiratory droplets. The findings were then replicated in a second group of cats. Ferrets, which are already being used in vaccine trials for Covid-19, were also found to be susceptible.\nExperts said the findings were credible, but that they did not indicate cats were an important vector in spreading the disease between humans.\nProf Eric F\u00e8vre, chair of veterinary infectious diseases at the University of Liverpool, said: \u201cPeople should take usual precautions of hand washing when handling their pets, and avoid overly intimate contact, especially if sick with Covid. It is important to add that this says nothing about how the virus coming out of a cat may or may not be infectious to humans.\u201d\nProf Jonathan Ball, a virologist at the University of Nottingham, said similar observations of transmission in cats had been made in relation to Sars, which is genetically closely related to Covid-19. \u201cHowever, it should be remembered that cats are not playing much, if any, role in the spread of this virus,\u201d he said. \u201cHuman to human transmission is clearly the main driver, so there is no need to panic about cats as an important source of virus. Obviously, if you think you have Covid-19 and share a house with a cat, then it would be sensible to limit close interactions with your furry friend until you are better.\u201d",

        "content": "Airline\u2019s owners need to dig deep into their own pockets before the state steps in to help\nYou have to admire Sir Richard Branson\u2019s tactics. A begging letter from an island-dwelling billionaire doesn\u2019t gain sympathy. A co-ordinated lobbying campaign that involves Airbus, Heathrow airport and Rolls-Royce \u2013 all big employers in the UK \u2013 gets noticed at the Treasury.\nAnd, naturally, one can see why the trio want Virgin Atlantic to survive, whether by a government-backed bailout or other means. The airline is an important customer for each of them. Virgin Atlantic flies 31 planes fitted with Rolls-Royce engines and has another 21 on order. Airbus makes wings for its A330 aircraft in north Wales.\nYet the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, cannot simply roll over. His stance on airline bailouts was clear and correct a fortnight ago. He had already helped the industry hugely via the \u201cfurlough\u201d scheme, which will pay 80% of staff wages during shutdown. Individual requests for support would only be entertained \u201cas a last resort\u201d and would \u201conly be considered if all commercial avenues have been fully explored, including raising capital from existing investors\u201d.\nSo what fresh capital have Virgin Atlantic\u2019s owners contributed? Branson\u2019s Virgin Group owns 51% of the airline and the rest belongs to Delta Air Lines, a major US carrier and a company still worth $15bn (\u00a312.1bn). The duo should, in theory, be able to raise serious sums, even in the current climate.\nDetails, though, are as clear as mud. Branson is reported to have injected $250m into his Virgin Group, but it\u2019s unclear how much is destined for the airline, and in what form. The Treasury needs to establish the facts before it even thinks of advancing a penny to a loss-making airline, let alone the reported \u00a3500m-worth of loan and credit guarantees.\nThe case for state assistance looks weak. It\u2019s up to Branson and Delta to prove otherwise. That means digging deep themselves, as opposed to getting other people to write letters.\nDear chief executive, would you prefer to cancel your bank\u2019s dividend or resign? Put like that (well, almost), banking bosses followed instructions from the Bank of England. Dividends are banned, in effect, for the rest of the year.\nThe investment banking divisions of these institutions, some of which will be making a ton of money from the volatility in financial markets, may find they\u2019re also told to drain bonus pools next January and February. Let\u2019s see if they would actually obey, but the nation probably wouldn\u2019t weep if executives and traders go bonus-less next year.\nThreadneedle Street, albeit via its comical \u201cvolunteer or else\u201d letters, has done the right thing. First, the dividend curbs will keep about \u00a37.5bn within the banking system, capital that can be used to support more lending if the hoped-for V-shaped recovery doesn\u2019t materialise.\nSecond, if the economic emergency becomes truly awful, some banks may yet need to raise capital from shareholders via rights issues. That prospect is still distant but can\u2019t be ignored. It would be silly to dispatch cash to investors now if there\u2019s even an outside chance that a capital top-up is needed within a year.\nThird, laying down the law to banks helps elsewhere. It is easier for the Treasury to resist every individual corporate demand for a bailout if regulated banks are seen to be pushed beyond their comfort zone.\nThere are possible long-term dangers, it should be said. Regulators are not just stopping dividends, they\u2019re interfering in other ways \u2013 such as forcing banks to take on more lending risk, even with government-backed coronavirus loan schemes. The risk is the creation of a paralysed banking system unable to fund a recovery at the other side of the crisis.\nThat, though, is tomorrow\u2019s problem \u2013 and one, we hope, that never arrives. In the meantime, the game is about preserving lending capacity. That\u2019s tough on shareholders, especially the retail brigade who were only there in search of previously safe-looking income. Sadly for them, there\u2019s nothing that can be done: in a crisis, banks get requisitioned.\nClothing retailer Next looks better equipped than most in its sector to withstand a long period of shop closures. If it\u2019s looking for sale-and-leaseback deals on properties to reinforce an already strong(ish) balance sheet, it\u2019s bracing for extreme stresses. The approach is sensible \u2013 but it also sends a very bearish signal for retail property market.",

Of those, about 1,000 deaths have occurred from coronavirus in New York City, now the center of the epidemic in the US.\nCuomo noted many people are looking for answers about when this crisis will end, but he said it was currently impossible to say. \u201cNobody knows what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Cuomo said.\nHe announced that city-controlled playgrounds in New York City would be closed, which affects not just children playing but community basketball, volleyball and other such activities, because people are not staying apart.\nNew York authorities rushed to mobilize an army of medical volunteers, as other hotspots flared around the country in places such as New Orleans, Detroit and southern California.\nIn New York City, which is eerily quiet during a stay-home order by the authorities, bodies of those taken by coronavirus are now being loaded on to refrigerated morgue trucks by overwhelmed hospitals \u2013 in some cases in full view of passing motorists.\nCuomo predicted that based on modeling projections, the worst time for deaths in New York will be the end of April and prompting the need for between 75,000 and 110,000 beds for Covid-19 patients and between 25,000 and 37,000 ventilators for extreme cases, depending on how effective stay-home and physical distancing orders are.\nBy Wednesday midday the US had about 188,000 confirmed coronavirus cases and the death toll was 3,918.\n  Worldwide, about 900,000 people have been infected and more than 44,000 have died, according to a tally kept by Johns Hopkins University, though the real figures are believed to be much higher because of testing shortages, differences in counting the dead and large numbers of mild cases that have gone unreported. \n  Healthcare workers who have hit the ground already, many brought in by staffing agencies, have discovered a hospital system becoming overwhelmed. Some patients from New York City have been transferred to Albany.\n\u201cI have never seen so many human beings in an ER at one time in my entire life,\u201d said Liz Schaffer, a nurse from St Paul, Minnesota, who had her first shift on Tuesday at Mount Sinai hospital. \u201cShoulder to shoulder. It is a sight I never thought I would see. Patients are dying every day. Every single day.\u201d\nWith New York on near lockdown, the normally bustling city streets are so empty that a single siren, to some, is no longer the easily ignored urban background noise.\n\u201cAfter 9/11, I remember we actually wanted to hear the sound of ambulances on our quiet streets because that meant there were survivors, but we didn\u2019t hear those sounds, and it was heartbreaking. Today, I hear an ambulance on my strangely quiet street and my heart breaks, too,\u201d said Meg Gifford, 61, a former Wall Streeter who lives on Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side.\nWith many city police officers and fire department EMS teams off sick, the city is experiencing a shortage of ambulance drivers and paramedics, as well as law enforcement officers.\nMeanwhile Mike Pence compared the United States to Italy in terms of the effects of coronavirus on the two countries.\n\u201cWe think Italy may be the most comparable area to the United States at this point,\u201d the vice-president told CNN on Wednesday in response to a question about death toll projections. Italy has seen the highest number of coronavirus deaths, already losing more than 12,000 residents to the pandemic.\nWhite House officials said yesterday that up to 240,000 Americans could die of coronavirus even if physical distancing measures are maintained.\nPence said those projections underscored the need to be vigilant in social distancing efforts over the next 30 days.",

We explain what is allowed and what is not\nSince the introduction of strict new measures to stem the spread of coronavirus, not everybody has been in agreement as to what exactly \u201clockdown\u201d means. One police force has defended its use of a drone camera to shame those driving into a national park, while another introduced roadblocks to stop people heading to tourist hotspots.\nThe extraordinary official powers introduced by the Coronavirus Act and the 2020 Health Protection Regulations, combined with the speed with which legislation passed through parliament, have left many uncertain about precisely what is permitted and what is a criminal offence under the lockdown.\nActivities under the health regulations that constitute a \u201creasonable excuse\u201d for leaving home are listed (alphabetically from A to M). They include obtaining food and medical supplies, taking \u201cexercise either alone or with other members of their household\u201d, seeking medical assistance, and providing care to a vulnerable person.\nAlso permitted is attending a funeral of a close family member, \u201cto move house where reasonably necessary\u201d, and any existing arrangements for access between separated parents and children. Travel for the purposes of work where it cannot be carried out from home, similarly for the provision of voluntary services, is also legal.\nThe problem has been that ministers and officials, eager to prevent transmission of the coronavirus, are circulating more restrictive guidance than is in statute or the regulations. Some police forces have been following their lead.\nOn Tuesday, Downing Street was forced to clarify that people could go out to buy food more than once a week, after the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, mistakenly said shopping trips should be limited.\nA Home Office announcement from 26 March said individuals could only leave their homes for \u201cvery limited purposes\u201d including \u201cone form of exercise a day\u201d. Some police force websites also initially listed exercise as being allowed only \u201conce a day\u201d. The health regulations, however, do not say anything about permitted frequency.\nIn Wales, the law is different. Welsh health regulations state that the reasonable excuse for leaving the house in order to take exercise is for \u201cno more than once a day\u201d.\nPolice have powers to order anyone to return home if they judge that they are out without reasonable excuse. Officers can also order anyone with a child to take a non-compliant youngster home. Where three or more people are gathered without reasonable excuse, they can be ordered to disperse.\nThe latest police guidance on enforcement does not specify what forms of proof would be required if, for example, someone says they are going to care for a vulnerable relative. It states that officers will apply the law \u201cin a system that is flexible, discretionary ad pragmatic. This will enable officers to make sensible decisions and employ their judgement. Enforcement should be a last resort.\u201d\nFailure to comply is punishable by a fine. Fixed penalty notices are \u00a360, or \u00a330 if paid within 14 days. For subsequent penalty notices, fines can rise to as high as \u00a3960. Those who do not pay can be taken to court.\nThe courts are not hearing many cases at the moment, but anyone who feels they have been fined inappropriately can go to court to contest it. Civil liberties organisations might contemplate supporting legal challenges in future if they think fines are being imposed unfairly and the lockdown continues for a long period.\nSorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen $https://audio.guim.co.uk/2020/03/31-39565-tagmp3fscovidlockdown.mp3\nSome consensus may be developing. Gracie Bradley, policy and campaigns manager at the human rights organisation Liberty, said this week: \u201cThere have been amazing community responses to this pandemic, and people have shown they are willing to change the way they live \u2013 but that goodwill, and the broader aim of protecting public health, will be undermined by harsh and heavy-handed policing.\u201d\nKaty Bourne, chair of the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners, said: \u201cWe are rightly proud of our policing by consent model in this country, and PCCs know that, in order for these measures to be truly effective, the police will need to maintain public confidence. That means calmly engaging, explaining and encouraging people to do the right thing, not being overzealous, and only taking enforcement measures as a last resort.\u201d\n This article was amended on 2 April 2020 to provide additional details about Welsh health regulations.",

Things that were unknown and alien a week ago are increasingly part of daily life. But some things do not need explaining. They feel instinctively right, or plain wrong and Premier League clubs furloughing their staff is one.\nOn Monday Mike Ashley took the plunge, announcing Newcastle would be the first club to stop paying all non-playing staff. Instead they could apply for emergency funding, 80% of their salary up to \u00a32,500 a month under the government\u2019s coronavirus job retention scheme.\nNewcastle turned over \u00a3178m in their last published accounts. Ashley was estimated to be worth just under \u00a32bn in the lastest Sunday Times rich list. Yet the move did not surprise many; a week previously Ashley had decided his Sports Direct retail business should ignore the national lockdown and carry on trading because it sold essential items, such as Lonsdale-branded flight bags, until government pressure told.\nTwenty-four hours after the Newcastle announcement, amid a lengthy statement calling on the world of football to \u201cwake up to the enormity of what is happening around us\u201d, Tottenham\u2019s chairman, Daniel Levy, said he would be also be furloughing staff, with the taxpayer to pick up the bill. Spurs had just announced a profit of \u00a3172.7m with Levy confirmed as the highest-paid director in English football, taking home \u00a37m.\nOn Tuesday Norwich joined the gang, although they would top up their employees\u2019 furlough payment so it matched their usual salary. Norwich operate on one of the smallest budgets in the Premier League but in 2018-19, in the Championship, they gave their highest-paid director \u00a3472,000.\nSorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen $https://audio.guim.co.uk/2020/03/30-59843-gnl.fw.20200330.jf.handofMont.mp3\nAre football clubs going through straitened times? No doubt. Not only have they been suddenly deprived of the revenuefrom playing matches \u2013 from tickets and bar receipts to the ads on electronic hoardings \u2013 they face the prospect of having to return money to broadcasters should the season not be completed and to sponsors whose logos will not have been seen as often as they were promised.\nIn losing out on income they had assumed was guaranteed, football clubs are hardly alone. Some, even in the top flight, could be classed as medium-sized enterprises, taking in less each year than a Tesco Extra. But despite that, football clubs are not an ordinary business.\nOf late there has been much speculation as to how the Premier League may complete the season and thus forestall some of its losses. The idea of a sporting \u201cmega event\u201d has been floated, with clubs playing lots of football in short order on TV. It has apparently been encouraged by government which, given the unknowable knock-on effects to public health, sounds about right. Such an event, it has been suggested, could boost the nation\u2019s morale.\nThis idea attests to an obvious fact: Premier League football plays a central role in British life. Clubs and players are put on pedestals, treated as role models and heroes. They did not ask for it to be that way but to say those at the top do not benefit, and enjoy benefiting, from that privilege is nonsense. That is why actions such as those taken by Newcastle, Tottenham and Norwich have immediately and pungently failed the smell test.\nIn the middle of all this are the players. We are used to the fetishisation of their great wealth and the question, never far behind, as to whether they deserve it. They did not create this problem but their union, the Professional Footballers\u2019 Association, is wrangling with the Premier League over whether their wages should be subject to alteration in order to help clubs stay afloat.\nThe PFA does not trust the clubs and perhaps rightly so. On the other hand the PFA is an opaque organisation with questions that linger over what it does with its substantial revenues beyond paying its chief executive, Gordon Taylor, a salary comparable to that of a Premier League player.\nThe players should take this moment and break from their union. Like many others in this crisis they should use it to do good. Bournemouth are pursuing the same approach as Norwich but Eddie Howe and his staff are taking pay cuts voluntarily.\nPremier League players should follow Leeds\u2019 example and offer to forgo a portion of their salary, too, so that none of their colleagues are furloughed and to protect as many livelihoods lower down the pyramid as they can.\nIt\u2019s clear, from listening to individual players, that this is what many of them want. They should set an example to those higher up the football food chain and just do it. The country would thank them.",

        "content": "The solitude of lockdown has coincided with blue skies and spring sunshine. Artists like David Hockney can keep us connected\nAs Britain went into lockdown last week, it did so in dazzling sunshine. Spring was announcing its arrival as an entire nation headed indoors. This sad, unseasonal hibernation seems against nature, but already it is generating its own intense kind of artistic energy.\nAs we sit separated, windows have become sites of reflection and, in a way, release. Tracy Emin, who made her name through minute and unsparing scrutiny of her private landscape, has published a daily diary. It features an image of the artist submerged beneath suds in the bath, knees pointing to the brilliant blue sky framed in the glass before her. \u201cI\u2019m going to climb out of my horrible little hole,\u201d reads part of the accompanying entry, \u201cand I\u2019m going straight towards the sun.\u201d\nA collection of art in the time of coronavirus, highlighted by Politico, a website usually devoted to drier fare, includes a painting of a block of flats in Pamplona, Spain. Through one open window, we see a home worker gazing at a screen. In front of another, a neighbour is immersed in a novel. From the sill of a third, a handsome black cat with white whiskers stares out. In Brooklyn, a woman has sketched herself looking out on the New York night. Underneath she writes: \u201cDisconnected from friends, family and the outside world, I feel like I\u2019m nowhere even when I\u2019m right here in my apartment, looking out my window.\u201d\nWindows are liminal spaces; thresholds connecting inside to outside, and public to private. They offer glimpses of other lives and help place our own in some kind of perspective. At a time when the parameters and scope of each day have shrunk so dramatically, it\u2019s not hard to see why artists are looking at them, as well as through them \u2013 particularly when the sights we see at this time of year are so poignant. David Hockney, currently in lockdown in France, has just published, at the request of his friends, 10 portraits of spring in Normandy, having moved there two years ago. Mr Hockney relocated in his 80s specifically to capture the rich display of apple, pear and cherry blossoms that colour the Norman landscape in March and April. This chronicling of rebirth and renewal is another kind of threshold art, celebrating the new, the burgeoning and the yet-to-come. One work devoted to spring daffodils carries the enjoyably belligerent title Do Remember They Can\u2019t Cancel The Spring.\nCharacteristically succinct, Mr Hockney says that the lesson he takes from this extraordinary time is that in life, only food and love truly matter. The source of art, he adds, is love. Ms Emin, in her diary, says something similar in her own style: \u201cI\u2019m going to feel warmth and safety and kindness and all that \u2026 AND I WILL BE LOVED BY YOU\u201d. Love, transcending the boundaries of the self, is the ultimate liminal experience. Through our windows, and in our imaginations, its future fulfilment is already being anticipated. Perhaps this awful, eerie spring of 2020 can still be touched by moments of the sublime.",

        "content": "BMA doctors set out ways care may have to be rationed as UK braces for sharp rise in deaths\nStable coronavirus patients could be taken off ventilators in favour of those more likely to survive, it emerged on Wednesday, as another sharp rise in deaths left the UK braced for the outbreak to reach up to 1,000 deaths a day by the end of the week.\nIn a stark new document issued by the British Medical Association, doctors set out guidelines to ration care if the NHS becomes overwhelmed with new cases as the outbreak moves towards its peak.\nA rise in the death toll of 563 brought the overall total to 2,352, an increase of 31% on Tuesday\u2019s figure. If the total continues to grow in line with increases over the last week, it is on course to go past 1,000 new deaths recorded each day within three to four days.\nUnder the proposals, designed to provide doctors with ethical guidance on how to decide who should get life-saving care when resources are overstretched, hospitals would have to impose severe limits on who is put on a ventilator. Large numbers of patients could be denied care, with those facing a poor prognosis losing the potentially life-saving equipment even if their condition is improving.\nThe BMA suggested that younger, healthier people could be given priority over older people and that those with an underlying illness may not get treatment that could save them, with healthier patients given priority instead.\nThe document explained that the guidance has been drawn up because when the outbreak peaks, \u201cit is possible that serious health needs may outstrip availability and difficult decisions will be required about how to distribute scarce life-saving resources\u201d.\nThe BMA published its proposals amid concern over limits to NHS resources, with officials admitting on Wednesday that only 30 of the 30,000 new ventilators needed as the outbreak escalates will be available by next week.\nThe proposals came out as:\n A retired hospital medical director, Alfa Saadu, became the latest doctor to die of the virus after volunteering at a Hertfordshire hospital at the age of 68.\n New applications for universal credit approached 1m within two weeks, a rise of more than 500% that dwarves the increases seen during the financial crisis.\n The Ministry of Defence called up 3,000 military reservists to provide medical and logistical support to the NHS.\n Italy extended its lockdown to 13 April but recorded its lowest death toll in more than a week, sparking hopes that the outbreak there could be reaching a plateau.\n The UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres, described the global pandemic as \u201cthe most challenging crisis we have faced since the second world war\u201d.\nThe Department of Health and Social Care said as of 9am on 1 April, a total of 152,979 people had been tested, of whom 29,474 were diagnosed as positive \u2013 an increase of 4,324 on the previous day.\nLondon continues to report the highest number of deaths proportionally, accounting for more than a third of England\u2019s total. NHS trusts in the capital have now registered 728 deaths from coronavirus.\nBut the figures do not provide a precise picture of the deaths within 24 hours, as a number of deaths announced in Wednesday\u2019s figures occurred earlier in March.\nThe BMA paper, which is intended to help the UK\u2019s 240,000 doctors manage the difficult decisions the pandemic could throw up, explores a range of circumstances that could pose them with severe ethical dilemmas. It also suggests that patients who work in vital services and industries including the NHS, utilities and telecoms may be deemed a priority for an ICU bed.\nIn another suggestion that could prove controversial, the document said that ICU patients who do not improve or worsen after admission may have their treatment withdrawn under a new \u201ccapacity to benefit quickly\u201d approach.\nThe document said the NHS\u2019s limited supply of intensive care beds will inevitably mean that doctors will have to refuse access to some people, especially those with one or more underlying health conditions and those who are older, though it does not specify an age threshold.\nIt does not list the illnesses but they are likely to include heart problems, kidney disease, diabetes or a pre-existing lung condition such as COPD. One in four Britons have at least one such chronic illness.\n\u201cTo maximise benefit from admission to intensive care, it will be necessary to adopt a threshold for admission to intensive care or use of scarce intensive treatments such as mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation,\u201d it says.\n\u201cRelevant factors predicting survival include severity of acute illness, presence and severity of co-morbidity and, where clinically relevant, patient age. Those patients whose probability of dying, or requiring a prolonged duration of intensive support, exceeds a threshold level would not be considered for intensive treatment, though of course they should still receive other forms of medical care.\u201d\nRationing could become even tighter as the pandemic progresses, the document states. \u201cDepending upon the nature of the pandemic, there may be a need during its progress to shift from one level of service rationing to a more or less severe one,\u201d it says.\nPublic Health England has finalised an updated document setting out what protective kit should be worn in different medical settings, which it hopes will dispel the confusion, alarm and fear among frontline NHS staff.\nSources involved said that the document, due out on Thursday, represents a partial revision of the guidance that led to PHE facing a barrage of criticism from groups representing doctors, nurses, midwives and other NHS staff.\nThey accused PHE of downgrading advice issued by the World Health Organization about which situations need full PPE \u2013 double gloves, surgical gown, FFP3 extractor mask and a visor or goggles \u2013 and which others require just a surgical mask, apron and single pair of gloves.\nSources said that PHE\u2019s revised, final guidance, developed after discussions with about 1,000 doctors and medical groups, will increase the number of settings in hospitals where full PPE should be worn because of the risk of contracting the coronavirus and also the type of dealings with patients when both GPs and ambulance crews should wear either full PPE or the more limited form.\n The image on this article was changed on 2 April 2020 to replace one of a continuous positive airway pressure (Cpap) breathing aid, with one of ventilators.",

        "content": "Fears of further passenger deaths on coronavirus-stricken Zaandam unless governor relents\nThe family of a British man who died on a coronavirus-stricken cruise ship have appealed to Donald Trump and authorities in Florida to allow the vessel to dock, warning that more people on board will die unless they are allowed into port.\nJohn Carter, 75, died on Sunday 22 March after suddenly falling ill on board the Zaandam cruise liner. His widow, 74, has spent more than a week in isolation in their cabin suffering from coronavirus symptoms, their niece, Nicola Brown, said.\nSeveral Latin American countries refused to allow the Zaandam and its sister ship, the Rotterdam, into port. They passed through the Panama canal on Monday and both are travelling towards Fort Lauderdale, Florida, to attempt to dock. It remains unclear whether local officials will allow them into Port Everglades.\nRon DeSantis, the governor of Florida, has said the passengers, many of whom are elderly, cannot be \u201cdumped\u201d in his state, dismissing them as mostly \u201cforeigners\u201d. On Tuesday, Trump, said he would speak to DeSantis about allowing the cruise liners into port, but despite the US president\u2019s promised intervention no local permission has yet been given.\nBrown appealed to local officials in Broward county, south-east Florida, to let the Zaandam and Rotterdam into port. She said her aunt was stuck in a room with her husband\u2019s possessions and was desperate to get off the ship.\nShe told the Guardian: \u201cIt has been horrendous. As soon as it happened, they had to go into isolation. She\u2019s obviously isolated in a room with all of her husband\u2019s items. She is not feeling well herself, she has got symptoms \u2013 a really severe cough. I have just spoken to her and she is coughing away. She is completely isolated grieving my uncle. She\u2019s only got one channel on the TV \u2013 the news.\u201d\nBrown, an NHS midwife, said she did not know if her uncle, a businessman, had tested positive for Covid-19, but he was on a ventilator before he died. Three other people have died on the Zaandam, while nine have tested positive for Covid-19 and dozens of others are ill with flu-like symptoms.\nBrown said her uncle had been feeling well on the Friday before he died but quickly deteriorated after visiting the cruise liner\u2019s medical centre on Saturday.\nAppealing to local officials and to Trump, Brown said: \u201cThese are people. They are people that are unwell and they need to get home. It is the most inhumane thing. I feel desperately sorry for the crew. I feel like the crew is being ignored and it\u2019s all about the passengers. These are human beings and they need help, whatever nationality they are from.\n\u201cWe need to allow them to dock. They cannot just leave people who are seriously ill out at sea. They have tried to put a plan in place, but they have to allow the ship to dock initially first. You cannot just leave people out at sea with nothing. More people are going to die.\u201d\nOn Tuesday, local officials said they were waiting for another plan from the ships\u2019 operator, Holland America Line, that met a series of 12 conditions, but warned that the vessels would not be allowed into the port if they failed to meet them.",

        "content": "Some self-employed workers and high earners at risk despite subsidy plan, warn thinktanks\nMillions of people across Britain risk falling through gaps in the coronavirus wage subsidy plan and benefits system, according to two of the country\u2019s leading economics thinktanks.\nAfter ministers hurriedly pulled together plans to increase the level of financial aid available from the state as the Covid-19 outbreak intensifies, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said many self-employed workers would still get no support, while others would be left financially better off as a result of the crisis.\nThe Resolution Foundation thinktank also called on the chancellor to expand the universal credit benefits system to support more households.\nHighlighting sizeable gaps in the government plan to pay 80% of employees\u2019 salaries and self-employed workers\u2019 profits as the crisis mounts, the IFS warns that 2 million people who work for themselves would not be protected because: they do not earn enough from self-employment to be eligible; earn more than the \u00a350,000 threshold; or only started out working for themselves within the past year and therefore missing the threshold to prove their past income to receive wage subsidies.\nA further 2 million more people who run their own company will also slip through gaps in the safety net deployed last week by the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, because they pay themselves much of their income in dividends, and less through a salary. A salary can be paid partially by the government, while dividends are excluded.\nOffering an early glimpse of the divergent impact the coronavirus crisis will have for various groups in society, the IFS says a quarter of self-employed people will be financially better off than they otherwise would have been, even if their business is forced to shut down completely. This can happen if benefits income outweighs the 20% of lost earnings that are not covered by the state.\nIt says many of the self-employed whose incomes dry up will be able to receive universal credit now and 80% of their historical earnings for three months at the start of June. As these subsidies will also be based on past earnings, they could also be left financially better off.\nHowever, workers who lose their job completely will not be helped by the schemes as more companies across Britain consider slashing jobs in response to the crisis, the IFS warns, while those who have to take unpaid leave to cover caring responsibilities, or who face a cut in their earnings but continue to work, could also be left worse off.\nAlthough warning the measures are not as well targeted as would be expected in normal times, given the rapid onset of the crisis and the need to rush out support packages, the IFS says the average self-employed person and company employees would be better off than if the package had not been drawn up.\nIf employees are furloughed they will lose about only 12% of net family income, compared with 53% before the rescue measures. An average self-employed individual will lose about 14% of family income, compared with 44% before the changes were announced.\nStuart Adam, a senior research economist at the IFS, said: \u201cUnder pressure to come up with a workable scheme to support the self-employed at speed, the chancellor has erred on the side of generosity for most.\n\u201cBut some will fall through the gaps completely \u2013 including high earners and the newly self-employed \u2013 and others will see only part of their overall earnings covered.\u201d\nIn a separate report, the Resolution Foundation has warned that some people will miss the receipt of benefits they could be eligible for. It also urges the government to help medium-income households by scrapping rules that lower the level of support for those with savings over \u00a36,000 and rule out people with savings over \u00a316,000.\nSunak said last month he would inject a further \u00a37bn into the benefits system, raising the value of universal credit by \u00a31,000 this year.\nHowever, Karl Handscomb, a senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, said the government needed to bolster universal credit further to ensure the benefit system was \u201cbattle ready\u201d for the economic fallout of coronavirus.\n\u201cThe rollout of universal credit in recent years has been beset by controversy. But its performance over the next few months is the real test of this new benefit system, as it provides a living standards lifeline to millions of households.\u201d he said.",

        "content": "The pandemic has created a surge in demand, with some gun stores inundated with panic-buyers\nAmericans have responded to the coronavirus epidemic with a record-breaking number of gun purchases, according to new government data on the number of background checks conducted in March. \nMore than 3.7m total firearm background checks were conducted through the FBI\u2019s background check system in March, the highest number on record in more than 20 years. An estimated 2.4m of those background checks were conducted for gun sales, according to adjusted statistics from a leading firearms industry trade group. That\u2019s an 80% increase compared with the same month last year, the trade group said.\nNearly 1.2m total gun background checks were conducted in a single week, starting 16 March, breaking all previous records going back to 1998, according to FBI data.\nWhile the number of background checks doesn\u2019t correlate one-to-one in terms of guns sold, the number of firearm background checks conducted through the FBI\u2019s National Instant Criminal Background Check System is the best available proxy for gun sales in the United States. The figures highlight how the pandemic has created a surge in demand for gun ownership, with some gun stores finding themselves inundated with panic-buyers, including, at least anecdotally, many Americans purchasing a gun for the first time.\nThe record-breaking week of 16 March was when California residents were photographed lining up by the dozens outside local gun stores, as the Bay Area and then California as a whole announced the first emergency stay-at-home orders to prevent the spread of coronavirus in the United States.\nFriday 20 March broke records for the highest number of firearms background checks conducted nationwide in a single day: 210,308.\nAmericans can buy multiple guns from a licensed gun dealer with a single background check, meaning that the number of checks conducted does not reflect the total number of guns sold.\nIn most states, private citizens can also sell guns to each other without a background check, and these private sales are not included in the FBI\u2019s numbers. There is no way to track how many guns were bought and sold in private sales over the past month. Some states also allow residents who have a license to carry a concealed firearm in public to buy guns without a background check, another category of gun sales not included in the FBI\u2019s statistics.\nFederal firearms background checks are also conducted for reasons other than gun sales, including for validating permits to allow people to carry a concealed firearm in public, and, in California, for ammunition sales.\nThe National Shooting Sports Foundation, the trade group for the American firearms industry, produces regular \u201cadjusted\u201d estimates for gun background checks that subtract out background checks that the FBI tags as related to concealed carry permit applications, or to period checks by officials to make sure permits are still valid. This produces a lower number that is a closer proxy for gun sales.\nThe trade group\u2019s adjusted numbers for March are still \u201csimply eye-popping\u201d, Mark Oliva, a spokesman for the industry group, wrote in an email.\nThe second-highest week of total firearms background checks on record was 17 December 2012, the week after a mass shooting at the Sandy Hook elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, left 20 children dead, and sparked fears that the United States would pass sweeping national gun control measures.\nMore than 950,000 firearms background checks were conducted that week, though US lawmakers ultimately failed to pass any additional gun control legislation after resistance from gun rights activists and many Republican politicians.\nWhile the FBI statistics do not include any information on what kind of purchasers are driving the spike in gun sales, some gun sellers have said they are seeing increased numbers of new gun owners.\n\u201cRetailers have been telling us that the overwhelming majority of those buying firearms over the last month have been first-time gun owners,\u201d Oliva, the spokesman for the firearms industry trade group, wrote in an email.\nAmerican gun control advocates said they found the statistics on record-breaking numbers of firearms background checks concerning, and urged Americans to think twice before panic-buying a gun, particularly if they had never owned one before.\nConcerns have also been raised about children sheltering at home in houses where they might have access to guns, as well as the risk of gun suicide, which amount to approximately two-thirds of US gun deaths each year.\n\u201cWe need to prepare for the increased risk of more firearms in untrained hands,\u201d David Chipman, a senior policy adviser at Giffords, a leading gun violence prevention expert, said in a statement. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t think you needed a gun prior to March of this year, you certainly don\u2019t need to rush out and get one now.\u201d\nActivists said that the number of guns sold in the past month could have been even higher, if some cities and states had not told gun retailers to close during stay-at-home orders, deeming them non-essential businesses. However, some of these orders have been changed under pressure from gun rights activists, particularly after the Trump administration included firearms manufacturers, retailers and shooting ranges as part of the national\u2019s \u201cessential critical infrastructure workforce\u201d.",

We don\u2019t want it to come to the stockpile because then we have to take it, after it arrives, and bring it to various states and hospitals.\u201d\nThe president had urged states to \u201cmake a deal\u201d and buy personal protective equipment (PPE) directly from manufacturers, he added. \u201cWe\u2019ve asked states where they have large manufacturers of different types of equipment to use those local factories, those local plants and have it made directly, ship it right into the hospitals.\u201d\nTrump continued: \u201cWe\u2019re shipping things right in. We have, as you know, almost 10,000 ventilators which we need for flexibility. It\u2019s sounds like a lot but it\u2019s not.\u201d\nThe national guard had been authorised to move equipment into hospitals when necessary, he added.\nCiting officials at the Department of Homeland Security, the Post reported that the depletion of the national stockpile left the White House and states competing for PPE in a \u201cfreewheeling global marketplace rife with profiteering and price-gouging\u201d.\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) had shipped or delivered 11.6m N95 respirators, 26m surgical masks, 5.2m face shields, 4.3m surgical gowns, 22m gloves, and 8,100 ventilators, the White House said on 28 March.\nBut Andrew Cuomo, the governor of New York, has complained that Fema contributes to a bidding war between states for ventilators, likening the situation to eBay. Other state governors and city mayors have complained of a chronic lack of test kits, masks and ventilators.\nWednesday\u2019s White House coronavirus taskforce briefing made an unusual start as Trump was first joined by the attorney general, William Barr; the secretary of defense, Mark Esper; and top military officials, who did not seem concerned with physical distancing.\nAnd with America still digesting predictions that up to 240,000 people could die from the pandemic, the president instead focused on \u201cdrug cartels\u201d \u2013 a familiar applause line at his campaign rallies.\nThe president announced the sending of navy ships toward Venezuela as the US intensifies counter-narcotics operations in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific following a drug indictment against President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, who still controls the country.\nTrump said: \u201cAs governments and nations focus on the coronavirus, there is a growing threat that cartels, criminals, terrorists and other malign actors will try to exploit the situation for their own gain. We must not let that happen.\u201d\nEsper added: \u201cThe Venezuelan people continue to suffer tremendously due to Maduro and his criminal control over the country, and drug traffickers are seizing on this lawlessness.\u201d\nThe link to the coronavirus seemed tenuous at best. Gen Mark Milley, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, told reporters: \u201cWe came upon some intelligence some time ago that the drug cartels as a result of Covid-19 were going to try to take advantage of the situation and try to infiltrate additional drugs into our country.\n\u201cAs we know, 70,000 Americans die on an average annual basis to drugs. That\u2019s unacceptable. We\u2019re at war with Covid-19, we\u2019re at war with terrorists, and we are at war with the drug cartels, as well. This is the United States military. You will not penetrate this country. You will not get past Jump Street. You are not going to come in here and kill additional Americans.\u201d\nThe president was asked about reports that China had undercounted its coronavirus cases. He said: \u201cTheir numbers seem to be a little bit on the light side, and I\u2019m being nice when I say that \u2026 As to whether or not their numbers are accurate, I\u2019m not an accountant from China.\u201d\nSome viewers dismissed the Venezuela announcement as another Trump stunt. Joe Lockhart, a former White House press secretary, tweeted: \u201cTurning this off now. This is just completely ridiculous and dishonest. But it\u2019s what we\u2019ve come to expect from Trump and his Administration.\u201d\nEventually the defence officials left the podium and were replaced by Trump\u2019s health experts Deborah Birx and Anthony Fauci. The president against defended his preparations for the pandemic and denied he was at fault for a slow start in testing, claiming he \u201cinherited a very broken system\u201d. He praised healthcare workers as \u201cwarriors\u201d.\nTrump predicted a fast recovery for the economy once the virus had passed and expressed hope that Congress\u2019s next emergency relief bill will including spending on infrastructure.\nAnd the president, who had sought on Tuesday to prepare the nation for unfathomable loss of life, nevertheless could not resist some levity. He said of Fauci: \u201cHe was a great basketball player,\u201d and mused: \u201cI have hundreds of millions of people. Number one on Facebook \u2026 Did you know? I just found out.\u201d When a Fox News reporter asked him a tough question, the president snapped: \u201cWhat are you, working for CNN?\u201d",

The legislation also provides for the order to be revoked sooner if authorities deem it safe.\nThe order, however, can also be extended, or a new order imposed, if the threat of Covid-19 transmission remains.\nMick Fuller\u2019s comments on Thursday are the strongest indication yet that NSW will go the full distance of the legislated 90-day lockdown period.\nThey follow the federal government reducing the allowable size of public gathering to just two people (who don\u2019t live together), which has come down from 500 to 100, and then 10 over a little more than a fortnight.\nFuller said the rules would remain in place for 90 days, but, he hoped, not a day beyond.\n\u201cI certainly won\u2019t be seeking an extension \u2013 people will have gotten the message by then, hopefully,\u201d he said.\nThe commissioner conceded there was public confusion about what was permitted and what was prohibited. He urged people who were unsure about the rules to act as if they had Covid-19 and stay home in isolation.\n\u201cA good rule of thumb is that if you are questioning whether you should be doing something, it is best to give it a miss,\u201d he said. \u201cThe safest place is at home in isolation.\u201d\nThe NSW order makes it unlawful for any person in the state to leave their place of residence unless it\u2019s for an essential purpose \u2013 shopping for essentials, exercising, medical or compassionate care, and working or studying that cannot be done from home.\nThe government gazette lists 16 \u201creasonable excuses\u201d for a person to be outside their home. Leaving home without a reasonable excuse can now attract an $11,000 fine, or six month\u2019s jail.\nNSW\u2019s 90-day lockdown is the longest state-mandated movement restriction. It appears draconian next to Victoria\u2019s 14-day stay at home directions under the Public Health and Wellbeing Act. But Victoria\u2019s restrictions \u2013 escalated to \u201cStage 3\u201d on Tuesday \u2013 are designed to be regularly reviewed and extended.\n\u201cIt is highly likely, that they will be further extended beyond that [April 13 date],\u201d the premier, Daniel Andrews has warned the Victorian public of the social distancing measures currently in force in the state.\nAndrews said widespread adherence to Stage 3 restrictions would delay, and possibly obviate, the need for Stage 4 and 5 lockdowns.\nQueensland\u2019s home confinement direction is in place \u201cuntil the end of the declared public health emergency, unless they are revoked or replaced\u201d.\nIt outlines eight essential reasons people are allowed to leave their homes.\nTasmania\u2019s movement restrictions have been imposed for four weeks, from Monday. The only lawful excuses for leaving home are buying essential supplies, going to school or work, to exercise, or to check on neighbours or elderly relatives.\nThe rules, Premier Peter Gutwein has argued, are intended to avoid a \u201cfull lockdown\u201d where no movement is permitted.\nThe Northern Territory has not gone into lockdown, although the territory\u2019s borders are closed to travellers and some internal movement restrictions apply.\nChief Minister Michael Gunner has urged all Territorians to stay home \u201cif you can\u201d.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re out in public, around a lot of other people, you\u2019re rolling the dice on your health and your family\u2019s health,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead of rolling the dice choose the safest bet, stay home if you can.\u201d",

The Washington Post first reported the news.\nAt a coronavirus taskforce briefing at the White House on Wednesday, Fauci declined to comment on whether he was receiving security protection, deferring to the health department\u2019s inspector general.\nTrump interjected, saying that Fauci \u201cdoesn\u2019t need security, everybody loves him\u201d. If anyone were to attack Fauci, Trump added, \u201cthey\u2019d be in big trouble\u201d, touting the disease expert\u2019s high school athletic career.\n\u201cHe was a great basketball player, did anybody know that?\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe was a little on the short side for the NBA but he was talented.\u201d As basketball captain at Regis high school in 1958, Fauci had helped lead the team to an unlikely victory.\nAsked to comment on any increase in Fauci\u2019s security detail, Tesia Williams, a Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) spokeswoman, said: \u201cFor more than two decades, the office of inspector general has provided professional protective services for the HHS secretary and, as needed, to departmental leadership. In each case, OIG assesses and recommends the appropriate level of protection. I cannot confirm, at this time, that we are providing such services for Dr Fauci.\u201d\nThe immunologist has become an unlikely celebrity, representing the US scientific community facing off against the coronavirus pandemic. The NBA star Stephen Curry has called him \u201cthe Goat\u201d \u2013 greatest of all time. Fans have plastered his likeness on cupcakes, doughnuts, socks and prayer candles.\nBut Fauci has also become a public target for rightwing pundits and bloggers who believe he is undermining the president. An article in the rightwing outlet American Thinker called Fauci a \u201cDeep-State \u00adHillary Clinton-loving stooge\u201d, and referred to a seven-year-old email in which he praised Clinton for her stamina through the Benghazi hearings. Tom Fitton, the president of the conservative group Judicial Watch, a conservative group; and Bill Mitchell, host of the far-right online talkshow YourVoice America, have also reinforced Fauci criticisms and conspiracy theories.",

        "content": "Mass internment camps did not begin or end with the Nazis \u2013 today they are everywhere from China to Europe to the US. How can we stop their spread? \nAt the start of the 21st century, the following things did not exist. In the US, a large network of purpose-built immigration prisons, some of which are run for profit. In western China, \u201cpolitical education\u201d camps designed to hold hundreds of thousands of people, supported by a high-tech surveillance system. In Syria, a prison complex dedicated to the torture and mass execution of civilians. In north-east India, a detention centre capable of holding 3,000 people who may have lived in the country for decades but are unable to prove they are citizens. In Myanmar, rural encampments where thousands of people are being forced to live on the basis of their ethnicity. On small islands and in deserts at the edges of wealthy regions \u2013 Greece\u2019s Aegean islands, the Negev Desert in Israel, the Pacific Ocean near Australia, the southern Mediterranean coastline \u2013 various types of large holding centres for would-be migrants.\nThe scale and purpose of these places vary considerably, as do the political regimes that have created them, but they share certain things in common. Most were established as temporary or \u201cemergency\u201d measures, but have outgrown their original stated purpose and become seemingly permanent. Most exist thanks to a mix of legal ambiguity \u2013 detention centres operating outside the regular prison system, for instance \u2013 and physical isolation. And most, if not all, have at times been described by their critics as concentration camps.\nWe tend to associate the idea of concentration camps with their most extreme instances \u2013 the Nazi Holocaust, and the Soviet Gulag system; genocide in Cambodia and Bosnia. But the disturbing truth is that concentration camps have been widespread throughout recent history, used to intern civilians that a state considers hostile, to control the movement of people in transit and to extract forced labour. The author Andrea Pitzer, in One Long Night, her recent history of concentration camps, estimates that at least one such camp has existed somewhere on Earth throughout the past 100 years.\nThe definition of a concentration camp is sometimes fuzzy, but at root, such camps represent a combination of physical and legal power. They are a way for modern states to segregate groups of civilians by placing them in a closed or isolated location via special rules that are distinct from a country\u2019s main system of rights and punishments. Many have been set up under military jurisdiction \u2013 by the British during the Boer war, for instance \u2013 while others, such as the Soviet gulags, have been used in peacetime to deal with social \u201cundesirables\u201d.\nCruelty and the abuse of power have existed throughout human history, but concentration camps have not. They are little more than a century old. The earliest began as wartime measures, but on numerous occasions since then they have become lasting features. They are a product of technologically advanced societies with sophisticated legal and political systems and have been made possible by a range of modern inventions. Military technologies such as automatic weapons or barbed wire made it easier for small groups of officials to hold much larger groups of people captive. Advanced bureaucracy and surveillance techniques enabled states to watch, count and categorise civilians in ways they couldn\u2019t have done in earlier eras. As Pitzer writes, such camps \u201cbelong in the company of the atomic bomb as one of the few advanced innovations in violence\u201d.\nThis innovation haunts the political imagination of liberal democracies. The concentration camp is a symbol of everything such societies are supposed to stand against: the arbitrary use of power and the stripping of people\u2019s rights, the systematic removal of liberty; dehumanisation, abuse, torture, murder and genocide. When it is used to refer to contemporary places, the term \u201cconcentration camp\u201d is often reserved for the locations of the most serious human rights abuses, as when Amnesty International used it in a 2017 report estimating that 13,000 people had been murdered by Syria\u2019s Assad regime in the Saydnaya military prison outside Damascus. But politicians, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez among them, have also used the term to describe camps such as the ones the Trump administration has been running on the US border with Mexico.\nTo some, these comparisons minimise the use of concentration camps by Nazi Germany in its effort to exterminate Jews. For others, the comparisons are a necessary warning, not least because one kind of camp can easily transform into another. Pitzer gives the example of a refugee camp: if people are not allowed to leave, and are systematically denied their rights, then it starts to resemble more sinister creations. As authoritarians and rightwing populists reach positions of power in various parts of the world, liberals are voicing fears that history is repeating itself.\nSurveying what he called \u201ca century of camps\u201d in the mid-90s, the sociologist Zygmunt Bauman warned that the temptation for governments to use them would always be strong \u201cwhen certain humans are declared redundant or forced into a superfluous condition\u201d. There is no shortage of threats in the current century \u2013 from environmental catastrophe to the unfolding coronavirus pandemic \u2013 that are creating such conditions. The question is how to ensure that the concentration camp is not the state\u2019s inevitable response.\nIt is tempting to regard the concentration camp as an anomaly, but for some observers, such camps are a grim reflection of the way modern states work. After the second world war, as knowledge of the Holocaust became widespread, leading theorists sought to offer explanations for the genocide that had taken place, and the methods used to carry it out. Writing in 1950, the Martiniquan poet and politician Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire argued that the Holocaust \u201capplied to Europe colonialist procedures\u201d that until then had been reserved exclusively for people of colour.\nConcentration camps were indeed colonial in origin. Their earliest uses came at the turn of the 20th century \u2013 by the Spanish in 1896 to put down a rebellion in Cuba, by the US in 1899 to do similar in the Philippines, and by the British empire in southern Africa during the Boer war of 1899-1902. The first use of concentration camps for a deliberate policy of extermination was not in Europe but in German South West Africa \u2013 modern-day Namibia \u2013 between 1904 and 1907. (Germany only recently officially acknowledged its treatment of the Herero and Nama tribes as genocide.)\nFor C\u00e9saire, the appearance of camps in Europe itself was a direct result of the way in which Europeans had attempted to dehumanise their colonial subjects in order to exploit them, but ended up dehumanising themselves. \u201cColonisation,\u201d he wrote, \u201cworks to decivilise the coloniser, to brutalise him in the true sense of the word, to degrade him, to awaken him to buried instincts, to covetousness, violence, race hatred and moral relativism.\u201d\nThe German-Jewish political theorist Hannah Arendt also turned her attention to camps after the war. Like C\u00e9saire, Arendt drew links between the behaviour of European powers in their colonies and their conduct at home, but she also highlighted how some of the tools wielded by authoritarians had been put in place by democracies before the rise of fascism. In her 1951 book The Origins of Totalitarianism, Arendt pointed out that when France was occupied by Nazi Germany, for instance, the Gestapo was able to make use of draconian police powers already in existence to round up and detain civilians. These existed because France, like many other states in Europe, had been unable to deal with the mass displacement of people in the aftermath of the first world war and had instituted harsh measures to deal with unwanted migrants.\nIn 1940, Arendt had her own direct experience of this relatively novel form of containment. After fleeing Germany for France, she was placed in an internment camp at Gurs, near the Pyrenees. The camp had been established a few years earlier to detain republican refugees from the Spanish civil war; it was repurposed in 1939 for \u201cenemy aliens\u201d \u2013 a practice instigated by the British in the first world war and subsequently copied by many countries. The inmates had to endure overcrowding, disease and insufficient food rations, and were made to live together regardless of the fact that some were Nazi party members and others, like Arendt, were Jewish refugees. It was partly the memory of this that led Arendt to place internment on a continuum with the Soviet gulags and the Nazi death camps \u2013 as she saw it, the \u201cHades, Purgatory and Hell\u201d of state violence.\nThat the British, Americans, Spanish, French and Germans, among other nations, had all used concentration camps led some thinkers to ask whether such camps were inevitable features of the modern state. Perhaps the most provocative answer comes from the Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben, whose ideas have grown in prominence in the past two decades. For Agamben, the existence of the concentration camp reveals something fundamental about power \u2013 who holds it, and what gives them the authority to wield it. His work is dense, ranging across ancient Greek and Roman law, Biblical texts and Renaissance literature, but it has been influential on a generation of scholars and activists in the past two decades \u2013 particularly among those who wanted to understand the camp established by the US at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, under an emergency policy after 9/11, or the growing phenomenon of immigration detention at the borders of the rich world.\nSovereignty, as Agamben sees it, is founded on absolute power over human life, and has been since ancient times. The sovereign has the power not only to kill, but to strip people of rights through forms of banishment, reducing them to a state of what he calls \u201cbare life\u201d. In the past, sovereignty would have been concentrated in the figure of the monarch; modern states are supposed to have improved upon monarchy by restraining the arbitrary use of power through democratic checks and balances. But, according to Agamben, the tendency to banish and dehumanise keeps on coming back in the form of the concentration camp: a space where people are outside the law, yet more subject to its power than anywhere else.\nFor Agamben, this reveals the basis on which power is exercised by modern states. In his words, the concentration camp is the \u201cnomos\u201d or fundamental principle of modern societies, the \u201chidden matrix\u201d of politics in our age. While they may only sometimes use it, governments retain the power to declare emergency measures \u2013 a \u201cstate of exception\u201d in Agamben\u2019s words \u2013 to strip us of rights, and confine us to spaces in which we live a kind of exile. The camp\u2019s logic, he implies, pervades seemingly free societies through modern state techniques of surveillance, bureaucracy, violence and other forms of coercion.\nGrand theories such as those of C\u00e9saire, Arendt and Agamben are valuable, but risky. By seeking to identify common patterns across specific societies, at different moments in history, they warn that all modern states have the potential to set up concentration camps. Misconstrued, however, they can end up obscuring crucial differences \u2013 such as the distinction between camps used in a deliberate policy of extermination, and those where people die through neglect. Holocaust deniers, for instance, or people who seek to downplay the severity of colonial massacres, often try to muddy these distinctions.\nWhen theory becomes dogma, it can also limit our understanding of the present. Agamben\u2019s own recent trajectory offers a cautionary tale: in late February 2020, he published a short essay in the leftwing Italian newspaper Il Manifesto criticising his government\u2019s draconian restrictions on public freedoms aimed at halting the spread of the coronavirus. The piece referred to \u201cthe invention of an epidemic\u201d, and went further than merely questioning the long-term impact of these restrictions; it condemned them as \u201cfrenetic, irrational, and entirely unfounded\u201d, arguing the virus was \u201cnot too different from the normal flu\u201d. The piece has been widely criticised, and provoked a retort from the French philosopher Jean-Luc Nancy that had he listened to Agamben\u2019s advice not to have a heart operation 30 years ago, he would now be dead.\nAgamben is hardly the only person to have underestimated the threat posed by the coronavirus in recent months. As more governments pass emergency laws to deal with the pandemic, in some cases including draconian surveillance measures and the establishment of segregated quarantine camps, it is right to ask where these might lead, and whether states will be willing to give up their new powers once the immediate danger to public health has passed. But that shouldn\u2019t obscure the fact that some emergencies are real: in these situations, the most important question is whether societies can respond to them without permanently destroying people\u2019s rights.\nConcentration camps are uniquely dangerous spaces. Their effects may vary considerably, from the horror of Auschwitz to the more mundane misery that Arendt experienced in Gurs, but the people caught up in them almost always end up being treated as less than human. And if the political and technological innovations of the late 19th century made them possible, does the 21st century make them any more likely?\nIn 2014, the Chinese government launched an initiative it called the Strike Hard Campaign Against Violent Terrorism, focused on the province of Xinjiang, in the country\u2019s far west. In the English-speaking world, details of the programme remained scarce until 2017, when reports started to filter through that thousands of people from Xinjiang\u2019s ethnic Uighur population, most of whom are Muslims, were being detained. The following year, researchers who trawled through Chinese government procurement documents and satellite imagery pointed to the existence of a vast, newly constructed complex of internment camps, which they estimated had the capacity to hold anywhere between several hundred thousand and 1.5 million people. Former inmates have given testimony to journalists and researchers that they were forced into \u201ceducation\u201d programmes, made to eat pork and drink alcohol, and given compulsory sterilisation and abortions.\nThis is just one example of how globalisation and technology have added a new dimension to an old problem. China has a long history of running camps \u2013 the political \u201cre-education\u201d programme launched by Mao in the 50s was one of the world\u2019s most extensive gulag networks. But the latest crackdown has new features. First, the Xinjiang camps are backed up by state-of-the-art digital surveillance methods provided by leaders in the global tech industry: a computerised CCTV network developed by a state-run defence manufacturer, designed to \u201capply the ideas of military cybersystems to civilian public security\u201d, which tracks individuals and analyses their behaviour to anticipate potential crime; a tracking app that visitors to Xinjiang are obliged to install on their smartphones; DNA analysis equipment partly supplied by US biotech firms. Second, China has justified its crackdown to the rest of the world by adopting the same rhetoric that the US and its allies used after 9/11. In 2014, the Communist party launched its so-called \u201cpeople\u2019s war on terror\u201d in Xinjiang. China\u2019s methods may be extreme, but it is by no means the first country to have introduced policies that subject Muslims to collective suspicion and punishment, in response to violent Islamic fundamentalist groups.\nWhat else could tempt states to open camps? In her 2014 book Expulsions, the sociologist Saskia Sassen argues that the particular form of globalisation the world has experienced in recent decades \u2013 driven by a new form of laissez-faire economics \u2013 has unleashed a dangerous new dynamic that excludes large numbers of people from economic and social life. The global shift to \u201cprivatisations, deregulation and open borders for some\u201d has brutally punished the vulnerable and accelerated environmental destruction.\nIn richer countries, Sassen argues, this leads to low-income workers being forced out of established welfare and healthcare programmes into more punitive systems (such as the UK\u2019s universal credit scheme), the impoverishment of sections of the middle class through austerity policies, and more and more people being locked up in prison. In poorer parts of the world, this means mass displacement and the warehousing of migrants as they try to move elsewhere.\nOne result of these global pressures has been the rise of political movements that promise to shore up national, religious or ethnic identities. But identities are ambiguous, and when governments start using the tools of state power to reinforce the line between insider and outsider, there are always large numbers of people who get caught in between. In India, the government of Narendra Modi has been trying to reshape the country along Hindu nationalist lines, undermining the secular and pluralist principles that have held sway since independence. The emerging camps in Assam, a north-eastern state on the border with Bangladesh, are a result: they target thousands of mainly Muslim residents who may have lived in India for decades, but because they originally came from across the border in Bangladesh \u2013 a legacy of partition \u2013 have never been registered as citizens.\nThe understandable response when confronted with injustice is to look for someone to blame. It\u2019s easier to do so when oppression is perpetrated by villainous leaders, or in other people\u2019s societies. But particularly in liberal democracies, the chains of responsibility can be complex. Who, for instance, is responsible for the arbitrary imprisonment, torture and slave-labour conditions that migrants and refugees in Libya are subjected to? The immediate answer seems fairly simple: the state officials and local militias, some linked to trafficking networks, who run the detention centres. Thousands of people, mainly from sub-Saharan Africa, are imprisoned in a network of these centres where they are regularly subjected to starvation, disease, torture, rape, and forced labour.\nBut the reason those detention centres exist is because a range of European governments have been trying to get Libya to act as a block on unwanted migration across the Mediterranean for almost 20 years. The system was built with European support, both from national governments and at EU level \u2013 first through agreements with the government of Muammar Gaddafi, then, as the country collapsed after he was overthrown by a Nato-backed uprising, a patchwork of arrangements with state officials and local militias.\nThere is no shortage of information about what happens in Libyan detention centres \u2013 and European governments frequently profess their horror at the atrocities committed there. Yet the system persists, because those governments broadly agree that the goal of limiting migration is more important than dismantling Libya\u2019s detention system. The political consensus in most European countries, including the UK, is that limiting unwanted migration is a reasonable and desirable aim, and large numbers of their citizens have voted in support of it.\nWhen Zygmunt Bauman turned his attention to camps in the 90s, he argued that what characterises violence in our age is distance \u2013 not just the physical or geographical distance that technology allows, but the social and psychological distance produced by complex systems in which it seems everybody and nobody is complicit. This, for Bauman, works on three levels. First, actions are carried out by \u201ca long chain of performers\u201d, in which people are both givers and takers of orders. Second, everybody involved has a specific, focused job to perform. And third, the people affected hardly ever appear fully human to those within the system. \u201cModernity did not make people more cruel,\u201d Bauman wrote, \u201cit only invented a way in which cruel things could be done by non-cruel people.\u201d\nWhen something today is described as a concentration camp, it almost always provokes an angry dispute. If camps aren\u2019t being used to exterminate people, as they have been in their worst instances, then the comparison is frequently condemned as inappropriate. But condemnation can be a way for governments to shield themselves from criticism of their decisions, and from criticism of the legitimacy of state power itself.\nIn 2018, Donald Trump\u2019s government responded to a rise in the number of undocumented migrants \u2013 many of whom were asylum-seekers fleeing violence in Central America \u2013 crossing the US-Mexico border by drastically increasing the use of long-term immigration detention. Reports of overcrowding, filthy conditions and the denial of due process for asylum claims soon followed, accompanied by measures that seemed intended to make a symbolic display of cruelty, such as the separation of young children from their parents. In June 2019, amid the outcry from opponents of this policy, congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez recorded a video for her Instagram followers: \u201cThe US is running concentration camps on our southern border,\u201d she stated, \u201cand that is exactly what they are \u2026 I want to talk to the people that are concerned enough with humanity to say that \u2018never again\u2019 means something.\u201d\nThis was a political intervention intended to shock people into challenging the Trump government\u2019s immigration policy \u2013 and in the row that ensued, some commentators objected that Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s reference to concentration camps and her use of the phrase \u201cnever again\u201d was an inappropriate Holocaust analogy. As the historian Deborah Lipstadt commented, \u201csomething can be horrible and not be like the Holocaust\u201d.\nBut much of the response from Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Republican opponents was to downplay the extent of abuses happening as a result of Trump\u2019s policies, or to portray what was happening as normal and routine. Some pointed out, for instance, that Trump was only making modifications to a system built by his predecessors: deportations of undocumented immigrants, for instance, reached their peak under Barack Obama. These sorts of equivocations have accompanied the use of camps from their inception, and they always try to give the same impression: that what\u2019s being done is normal and legitimate, that criticisms are overblown, marginal and extreme; and that states have the right to behave this way.\nThe story of Britain\u2019s concentration camps during the Boer war illustrates how a society that thinks of itself as liberal can make excuses for a mass crime. In 1899, when the British empire went to war against two breakaway Afrikaner republics in South Africa, it set up a network of camps that quickly expanded to detain several hundred thousand people. At first the camps were justified as \u201cprotection\u201d for Boer civilians who had signed an oath of loyalty; later, they were used to imprison Boer \u201cundesirables\u201d who had not signed the oath, as well as black South Africans who the British forced off their land to make them act as lookouts for troops. Due to poor sanitation, meagre food rations and overcrowding, diseases such as typhoid and measles frequently ripped through the camps; at least 28,000 white people and 20,000 black people were killed by this system in just a few years.\nThe two most prominent critics of Britain\u2019s camps \u2013 the feminist campaigners Emily Hobhouse and Millicent Fawcett \u2013 both had to struggle against political and public opinion that initially saw the camps as a wartime necessity, and both fought hard to alleviate suffering. But the grounds on which they did so were radically different, as the author Vron Ware has recently argued. Fawcett, who visited South Africa with the government\u2019s approval to produce a report on the camps, saw her concern for the welfare of vulnerable civilians as compatible with the wider aims of the camps. \u201cSaving the children,\u201d for her, was \u201cas true a service to the country as that which men were rendering by going into the armies to serve in the field\u201d. But for Hobhouse, who was the first prominent activist to visit South Africa and expose conditions in the camps, British military values and the nationalism that underpinned them were the fundamental problem. She was challenging the legitimacy of state power itself.\nHobhouse, who in her day was derided in sexist terms as a \u201cmad\u201d old lady, is now largely forgotten, while it is safe to say that Britain\u2019s concentration camps are not well remembered: last year the Conservative politician Jacob Rees-Mogg defended their use on an episode of Question Time, erroneously claiming that their mortality rate was only the same as that of Glasgow\u2019s at the time. But without Hobhouse\u2019s radical critique, it would have been harder to oppose the harm done by Britain\u2019s camps a century ago, and would be harder to understand why camps still appear in the world today.\nThe point of historical comparisons should not be to find identical situations \u2013 no two events in history are identical \u2013 but to alert us to potential dangers in the way states exercise power. Not everyone, for instance, reacted with outrage to Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s comments last year. While she drew criticism from some Jewish organisations, including a rebuke from the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem, the row also energised a US protest movement against Trump\u2019s immigration policy led by leftwing Jewish activists. The movement calls itself Never Again Action, explicitly drawing on a collective memory of persecution.\nIn his final book, The Drowned and the Saved, the Auschwitz survivor and author Primo Levi reflected on the conditions that had made the Nazi camps possible, and wondered what lessons, if any, could be applied to a world that had moved on. The unique combination of factors that had unleashed the horror of Nazism was unlikely to return, he thought, but that should not obscure the danger of violence in our own time, or the politicians who seek to wield it. Violence, he wrote, \u201cis there before our eyes \u2026 it only awaits its new buffoon (there is no dearth of candidates) to organise it, legalise it, declare it necessary and mandatory and so contaminate the world\u201d.\nIf the state as we know it is here to stay, then what can people do when governments start building camps? The history of the concentration camp has also been a history of people\u2019s resistance to camps, from both inside and out. Even in the most seemingly hopeless situations there are stories of people who have fought back against their treatment. The uprisings in the Nazi death camps of Sobibor and Treblinka are among the most famous; and the Soviet Gulag system was beset by strikes and revolts. On their own, these may not have been enough, but camps work by enforcing a rigid distinction between people on opposite sides of the barbed-wire fence. Those inside are kept silent and invisible, while those outside are encouraged to ignore or accept what is happening. Successful resistance aims at breaking down this distinction: governments know this, and even states that operate relatively mild forms of mass detention make significant efforts to obscure the conditions inside, and to deter their own citizens from prying too closely.\nOne evening in February this year, I watched the Kurdish author Behrouz Boochani give a talk by video link to an audience at Birkbeck, University of London. Boochani, who currently lives in New Zealand, spent four years in Australia\u2019s \u201cregional offshore processing centre\u201d for asylum-seekers on Manus Island, Papua New Guinea. Australia has pioneered a type of long-term detention for unwanted migrants that is now becoming more common elsewhere in the world. Boochani and his fellow detainees were not merely being held for \u201cprocessing\u201d, but in harsh conditions intended to act as a deterrent to future travellers. The Australian government forbade journalists to report on the full extent of these conditions, which included the beating and abuse of detainees, and introduced a law threatening doctors and social workers with up to two years in prison if they spoke in public about what they had witnessed.\nBoochani, however, smuggled out accounts of life in detention, via text messages sent to his translator by WhatsApp, that were turned into articles for the Guardian and other outlets \u2013 as well as a memoir, No Friend But the Mountains. Boochani explained to us how he saw his detention as part of Australia\u2019s \u2013 and Britain\u2019s \u2013 longer history of treating non-white people as disposable. \u201cIt\u2019s worse than a prison,\u201d he said of the Manus camp. \u201cIt\u2019s a place where they take your identity and freedom from you, and try to destroy you.\u201d Detainees were given numbers, he said, which the guards used instead of their names; his was MEG45.\nThe camp on Manus Island was eventually shut down by the Australian government, after widespread public criticism, although its broader asylum policies remain largely the same. For Boochani, writing was not simply a way to expose his conditions and link up with campaigners against detention on the outside, but to challenge the very basis on which the treatment of people like him was justified. \u201cI never use the language and the words that the [Australian] government use,\u201d he said. \u201cI say \u2018systematic torture\u2019, I say \u2018political prisoner.\u2019\u201d One of the things that gave him hope in confinement, he said, was the fact that animals could wander in and out of the spaces where human freedom was limited \u2013 a reminder that the structure which held him was built by people, and could therefore also be dismantled. \u201cNature,\u201d he said, \u201calways tried to reimpose itself on the prison.\u201d\n Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here.",

The death toll is also close to the 50,000 mark with the current number on 47,235.\nUK ministers are facing a torrent of criticism about the country\u2019s low rate of testing for coronavirus in the wake of the revelation that only 2,000 NHS staff have been tested out of more than 500,000. After the UK\u2019s record daily increase in the number of deaths, there is mounting concern and anger that the government followed a flawed strategy based more on mathematical modelling than established public health practice. Here is what the UK papers think of the testing mess. As well as facing the threat of contacting Covid-19, medical staff also face the dilemma of choosing which patients to keep on ventilators as the machines remain in short supply.\nDonald Trump has admitted that the US is running down its stockpile of protective personal equipment as the nation faces a rapid rise in the number of virus cases. The US president urged states to \u201cmake a deal\u201d with manufacturers to obtain the much-needed equipment as US cases rose well past 200,000. One of the experts on Trump\u2019s virus taskforce, Anthony Fauci, has reportedly been given extra security after it emerged that he had received some threats from people critical of his views sometimes seen as contradicting the president\u2019s pronouncements\nDr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has said he was \u201cdeeply concerned about the rapid escalation and global spread of infection\u201d. \u201cOver the past five weeks, we have witnessed a near exponential growth in the number of new cases, reaching almost every country,\u201d he said.\nTrump also said that Florida must allow two virus-stricken cruise ships to dock in the state to get passengers to safety. Four people have died \u2013 including one British man \u2013 and dozens of people are sick with flu-like symptoms on the Zaandam and Rotterdam cruise liners, which are awaiting permission to enter port in Fort Lauderdale. After Trump said: \u201cWe have to help the people\u201d, Florida\u2019s governor indicated he would allow the ships to dock in Fort Lauderdale. But authorities in Guam are angry that they may have to welcome thousands of US navy personnel off the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt.\nPhilippines president Rodrigo Duterte has been criticised after he ordered police to shoot dead residents who break quarantine rules and refuse to co-operate. His violent threat follows the arrest of 21 people who had apparently taken to the streets of Manila to demand help from the government. Also in Asia Pacific, Australia has announced free childcare during the crisis as it continues to rollout massive financial support for the economy. And New Zealand reported its biggest one-day rise in cases.\nTwo prominent musicians have died from the disease. Adam Schlesinger, from the band Fountains of Wayne, has died aged 52. Over his career, Schlesinger earned nominations for an Oscar, a Golden Globe, Tonys, Grammys and Emmys, winning the latter two. Also, the 80s underground pop singer Cristina, from the band Things Fall Apart, has reportedly died at age 61 after being diagnosed with coronavirus.",

But in the past 10 years their numbers have begun to recover, with a 10% increase in sightings.\nThis year the house sparrow remained at the top of the rankings as the most commonly seen garden bird. Starlings were the second most sighted, followed by the blue tit.\nDaniel Hayhow, an RSPB conservation scientist, said: \u201cSmall birds suffer during long, cold winters but the warmer January weather this year appears to have given species such as the wren and long-tailed tit a boost. Over the survey\u2019s lifetime, we\u2019ve seen the increasing good fortunes of birds such as the coal tit and goldfinch and the alarming declines of the house sparrow and starling. But there appears to be good news for one of these birds \u2026 giving us hope that at least a partial recovery may be happening.\u201d\nMore gardens reported seeing long-tailed tits, which were up 14%, while wrens were up 13% and coal tits up 10% in 2020 compared with 2019.\nBeccy Speight, the RSPB\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cDespite everything that\u2019s going on in the world, nature is still doing its thing. Birds are singing and blossom is bursting. Watching wildlife, whether from a window or a balcony or even online, can offer many of us hope, joy and a welcome distraction, and so we are keen to help you carry on connecting with the natural world.\u201d",

        "content": "Incident at major hospital raises fears over pressure on supplies during pandemic\nA major NHS hospital almost ran out of oxygen for its Covid-19 patients on ventilators because it was treating so many people with the disease who needed help to breathe.\nThe incident, which occurred at a London teaching hospital last weekend, has prompted NHS bosses to urgently warn all NHS trusts in England to limit the number of people they put on mechanical ventilators and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machines.\nNHS England was so concerned by what happened that it told hospital bosses in a letter on Monday that the risk constituted a \u201ccritical safety concern\u201d which could have major consequences for all patients relying on oxygen to stay alive. It told them to take a series of urgent actions to reduce the risk of their own oxygen supply suddenly running short because of heavy demand.\nIt told trusts that a sudden increase in patients receiving support with their breathing because of coronavirus, risks a hospital\u2019s oxygen supply failing altogether, which could cut off the supply to all those needing it to help them fight the infection in their lungs.\nThe NHS-wide surge in patients receiving oxygen also presents a second risk for a hospital \u2013 that its liquid oxygen storage tank, known as its vacuum insulated evaporator (VIE), could quickly become run down.\nBoth scenarios \u201cpresent a potentially significant risk to multiple patients\u201d, NHS England said.\nThe warning highlights how the dramatic recent increase in hospitals\u2019 use of ventilators and in particular CPAP machines, which dispense ventilation through a face mask, has brought with it those two main risks of a sudden and potentially very serious oxygen shortage. CPAP machines involve non-invasive assisted ventilation, whereas a mechanical ventilator does all the work and is particularly useful when the patient has lost the ability to breathe for themselves.\nThe letter says: \u201cIf the demand through multiple wall outlets [for wall-mounted CPAP machines] exceeds the maximum capacity of the VIE delivery system, there is a risk of rapid pressure drop in oxygen supply pipes.\n\u201cThis could lead to a failure of oxygen delivery systems throughout the hospital, including to patients on face masks, CPAP, ventilators and [in] operating theatres. There is also a risk of rapid and unpredictable depletion of the VIE [storage tank].\n\u201cBoth of these situations present a potentially significant risk to multiple patients simultaneously.\u201d\nUse of oxygen is not usually a potential hazard for hospitals because so few patients are on it, the letter says. \u201cHowever, during the coronavirus epidemic, a far greater proportion of patients will require O2 therapy and ventilation, and this presents a clear and significant risk to oxygen delivery systems within hospital estates,\u201d it adds.\nThe letter was signed by Prof Ramani Moonesinghe, NHS England\u2019s national director for critical care, Prof Andrew Menzies-Gow, its national clinical director for respiratory medicine, and Adrian Eggleton, its national estates operational lead and Covid-19 NHS estates lead.\nThey advise trusts in the letter to:\nCalculate the maximum number of patients who can be treated with high-flow [oxygen] devices such as wall CPAP and communication of this to the relevant clinical teams.\nImplement safety measures to prevent accidental O2 system failure (such as limiting the number of these devices available for clinical use).\nChris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents hospital trusts, said: \u201cThis is a very serious matter.\n\u201cThe particular characteristics of coronavirus mean that hospitals are likely to be using many more ventilators and much more oxygen than they normally do. We understand that the usage of CPAP machines on a systematic basis can use up significant amounts of oxygen. So it makes sense to highlight the risk of both how quickly oxygen supplies might be depleted and if that happens the potential risk to the core oxygen flow system.\n\u201cNo hospital would want to knowingly run the risk of having all its oxygen throughout the hospital fail at once, because of the impact on the patients using the oxygen, because oxygen treatment is so central to life-saving care,\u201d he added.",

        "content": "People are increasingly looking to restore the soil\u2019s ability to retain water, planting trees and hedges, and creating relief channels to tackle the recurring threat of high waters\nThere is ponding on nearly every field in the valley where the rivers Severn and Vyrnwy meet on the English-Welsh border. Swollen rivers have been sluggishly sitting in the valley for months. Inhabitants\u2019 attempts to protect their homes from flooding are part of a losing battle played out across the country.\nThe UK\u2019s flooding this year is a story of desperation \u2013 but also hope, says John Hughes, development manager at Shropshire Wildlife Trust, who works in the valley. Following widespread acceptance of the climate and ecological emergency, Hughes believes people are increasingly looking to nature for solutions.\nGeorge Eustice, the environment secretary, has announced that \u00a34bn will be spent on flood defences in the next five years and said a \u201cbig part of our focus is going to be nature-based solutions upstream\u201d.\nHughes says: \u201cThe media normally have a distinct agenda when it comes to floods which is: \u2018how miserable have you been?\u2019 This time around the interviews I heard were talking about natural solutions and I\u2019d never heard that before.\n\u201cI say thanks very much Extinction Rebellion and Greta [Thunberg] \u2013 you\u2019ve done a great job. It\u2019s the job we\u2019ve been trying to do for 50 years. We need to take a holistic view \u2013 land can do many, many things.\u201d\nIn the past, flood plains acted like sponges that soaked up water and stopped it flowing headlong into settlements downstream. Wetter habitats provided useful materials such as willow and reeds for baskets and thatched roofs. However, natural wet woodland, neutral grassland, fens and marshes were ironed out of the postwar landscape and now cover just 11% of English and Welsh flood plains. Intensive agriculture covers 70%.\nCrops such as maize, potatoes, asparagus and onions are harvested as late as October because of the milder UK climate. This means fields are often left bare over winter months after heavy machinery has compacted the soil. This leaves the land unable to soak up so much water.\n\u201cWhen you drive heavy vehicles on soggy soil you make a mess,\u201d says John Quinton, professor of soil science at Lancaster University. \u201cYou\u2019ve then destroyed the soil structure, and because of that water can\u2019t get into the soil very quickly. The water runs over the surface of the soil and picks up the soil and deposits it in rivers or elsewhere. If soils are in good condition, the water will go into the soil and you will have a lot of storage.\u201d\nScientists say creating grassland, giving land rest periods and avoiding the use of heavy machinery in flood-prone areas will reduce nutrient and sediment loss from fields. \u201cSome groups of farmers are definitely moving in the right direction. When I started my career in the late 80s we weren\u2019t talking about soil erosion or nutrient losses. Things are changing,\u201d says Quinton.\nExperts are only beginning to understand the complexity of soil ecosystems. In the flood-hit village of Eaton Bishop in Herefordshire, farm conservation adviser Caroline Hanks compares two spadefuls of soil from the same field near her house \u2013 one from the middle of the field where intensively farmed maize was harvested in October, and the other from under tussocky grass by the hedge. The first sample is root-free and heavily compacted, meaning water cannot percolate more than eight inches below the surface. The second spadeful is crumbly, full of roots and moist throughout. The two samples look \u2013 and smell \u2013 different.\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to give people a visual way to assess their soil. It\u2019s such a simple technique \u2013 you can tell so much from a spadeful of soil,\u201d says Hanks, who specialises in advising farmers on creating flower-rich grassland. \u201cTwenty years ago people expected us to focus on birds and hedgerows and field edges but these days getting a spade out and looking at soil is a core part of the visit.\u201d\nAccording to Quinton\u2019s Defra-funded research there is between three and 10 times more water run-off from compacted soils than healthy soils. \u201cThat rotten egg smell you get from compacted soils is certainly something that says to me that\u2019s an unhealthy soil,\u201d he says. \u201cIt shows that it\u2019s compacted and its normal biology isn\u2019t functioning very well. In the soil that\u2019s aerated you\u2019ve got fungi and bacteria which are active and sometimes after rain, you get that sweet smell of damp soil, and it\u2019s actually a compound called geosmin.\u201d\nMany natural flood-management techniques involve reinstating features that were once common to fields such as ponds, hedges and leaky dams (either created by fallen trees or beavers). Creating buffer strips, wooded areas, drainage ditches and re-meandering rivers are all part of the toolkit. The overall effect is to give the landscape more structure and roughness to counterbalance the way industrialised farming has smoothed it out.\nThe problem is that reducing food production is currently counterintuitive to most farmers\u2019 business plan, says Dr Marc Stutter, a soil and water scientist at the James Hutton Institute. \u201cThe biggest thing we\u2019re fighting against is that the farmers and their fathers and grandfathers have been very proud of the way they\u2019ve brought the land into condition for crops and quite rightfully so. Their parents have spent a lot of effort draining the land and now there\u2019s someone telling them they want pockets of it to be wet up again.\n\u201cIf we could reverse it and say they\u2019re not just farmers of a crop but stewards of the land then we might be able to think of water quality and flood resistance as part of their overall job.\u201d\nNatural flood management has other benefits \u2013 planting trees and hedges helps to create vital habitats for nature and locks away carbon. Creating buffer strips along streams and rivers helps filter out pollutants and improves water quality.\nHowever, nature-based solutions are no silver bullet, according to analysis by the University of Oxford which found they would be overwhelmed by the sort of floods seen in the UK this winter.\nMaking the land more absorbent should be used alongside traditional \u201chard engineering\u201d techniques such as flood walls, says Hannah Cloke, professor of hydrology at the University of Reading.\n\u201cPutting beavers in the River Thames is not going to keep people dry and a different solution is required. However, for some of the smaller communities you could implement woody debris dams and make sure the soil upstream is able to absorb the water. Not one size fits all. It must be an open discussion between farmers and Defra and the Environment Agency and scientists. It\u2019s not an easy problem but I think we should be confident that we can solve it,\u201d she says.\nIn 2015 Glenridding, a village at the bottom of Helvellyn in the Lake District, was one of many communities trashed by Storm Desmond.\nDanny Teasdale, a mechanic from the village, decided to do something. \u201cFlooding isn\u2019t going to go away, we\u2019ve got to start looking at things. There are extreme conservationists on one side and extreme farmers on the other and they keep clashing heads and nothing happens. I sit in the middle \u2026 I know the local farmers and they trust me,\u201d he says.\nIn the valley above the village, Teasdale created a wiggly upstream release channel that runs parallel to the river and fills up only when the river is full. He worked with the local farmer and the Environment Agency. The \u00a36,000 project was funded by a local flood action group.\nTeasdale says: \u201cWe\u2019ve just had really, really heavy rain with Storm Ciara and Storm Dennis \u2013 I think some of the heaviest since Storm Desmond \u2013 and it didn\u2019t flood this time. So it\u2019s looking like it\u2019s been helping. It goes hand in hand with hard engineering in the village but if you can slow things down upstream you don\u2019t need to build your walls so high.\u201d\nTeasdale\u2019s work was so successful he created a community interest group called Ullswater Catchment Management CIC in November 2018. He has since worked in a number of different catchments around Ullswater with the Woodland Trust, Natural England and the Environment Agency, including planting 2,000 trees in Grisedale valley at a cost of \u00a38,000 and a project to re-wiggle the river in Matterdale that cost \u00a314,000.\n\u201cIt\u2019s peanuts compared to the money that goes into hard engineering,\u201d explains Teasdale, who says \u00a32m has already been spent on hard flood defences in Glenridding.\nElsewhere in the Lake District, the RSPB led a similar river re-wiggling scheme in Swindale valley. The work cost \u00a3200,000 and involved letting the river meander back into its old course after being straightened by hill farmers looking to dry out land hundreds of years ago. The valley is a kilometre long and the river is now 180 metres longer.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about holding that water in the higher catchments for longer,\u201d says Lee Schofield, a site manager at RSPB Haweswater. \u201cHaving a wiggly river means they move more slowly. We\u2019re delaying flood peak \u2013 it\u2019s a low-tech solution that delivers many other benefits and makes the landscape much more resilient.\u201d\nPaul Quinn, a senior lecturer in catchment hydrology at Newcastle University, believes more drastic landscape measures, called catchment systems engineering (CSE), are needed to compensate for the fact that flood plains are already full of houses and roads. More than 40% of rivers have been deepened or modified so that they are no longer connected to their flood plains.\n\u201cIn a beautiful world that doesn\u2019t exist, we could get our soil back into good condition and that would actually stop a lot of floods. But when the big floods come along \u2013 the kind that climate change is going to produce \u2013 soil management is not going to do it,\u201d he says.\n\u201cCSE is halfway between nature-based solutions and something that\u2019s a bit like traditional flood management which is usually big dams, big ponds and big walls. We need to start spreading them out over the whole catchment system. It seems to me such a simple idea. It\u2019s not rocket science, it\u2019s about storing water \u2013 and large amounts of it \u2013 at every opportunity you can.\u201d\nQuinn\u2019s approach includes natural solutions as well as features such as the creation of large retention ponds and cascading channels. His team built 35 ponds and dams, and created 10 zones of oak, beech and willow plantations in the catchment attached to the village of Belford in Northumberland which has been badly affected by flooding. The scheme cost \u00a3200,000 and in the seven years since the work was completed the village has not flooded. \u201cEvery single catchment in the country will have to be done,\u201d he says.\nIn terms of soils, Quinton believes people\u2019s attitudes are already changing: \u201cI sense a shift in the farming community with a much greater emphasis on soils and how to sustain them. I have no evidence for this, except talking to farmers and watching Twitter. I get the feeling that there is increasing recognition that protecting soils is vital for the sustainability of the farm business.\u201d\nFarmers think of food production as their primary motivation because that is what they have been subsidised to do. Rather than trying to farm flood-prone areas of land that don\u2019t yield much, farmers may be subsidised to manage them for nature. Many feel the government is making the right noises with policies laid out in the new Environmental Land Management Scheme (ELMS) \u2013 which will be fully implemented by 2028.\nA Defra spokesperson told the Guardian that natural flood management would be an important part of protecting the nation from flooding. \u201cELMS will reward farmers for the public goods that they provide, including protecting communities from environmental hazards such as flooding. Natural England and the Environment Agency do vital work and we continue to work closely with both agencies to ensure they have the right resources to continue to do so.\u201d\nSoil management has featured prominently in ELMS \u2013 with funding set to be available for measures such as no-till agriculture and maintaining water in peat soils \u2013 but conservationists are worried that the devil is in the detail.\nTeasdale says: \u201cI\u2019ve seen what the government has done to Environment Agency and Natural England and what they\u2019ve done to their budget, and it\u2019s criminal. They\u2019ve slashed it. ELMS could potentially be good but it needs to be funded properly and that\u2019s what I\u2019m not sure about. I\u2019d love to be wrong.\u201d\nFind more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",

        "content": "Tony Burke says treasury briefing shows workers could be forced to exhaust leave while receiving new payment\nMillions of Australian employees could be left without leave entitlements due to a \u201cloophole\u201d in the Morrison government\u2019s new jobkeeper wage subsidy, Labor\u2019s Tony Burke has warned.\nThe opposition spokesman on industrial relations said on Thursday that, according to a treasury briefing to Labor, employees could be forced to exhaust their leave entitlements while receiving the new $1,500 fortnightly payment, transforming it from a \u201cwage subsidy\u201d for employees into a \u201cbalance sheet subsidy\u201d that benefits employers.\nLabor will take up the issue with the government, along with its advocacy for 1.1m temporary visa holders and 1m casuals with less than 12 months\u2019 service with one employer, who stand to miss out on the jobkeeper payment announced on Monday.\nIt comes as the industrial relations minister, Christian Porter, unveiled a suite of changes to modern awards to respond to Covid-19 shutdowns and improve flexibility, which he said could save tens of thousands of jobs and help employers through the downturn. The main two changes are to provide two weeks\u2019 unpaid pandemic leave for all employees and an ability to take double leave at half pay.\nBurke told an Australia@Home lunchtime briefing, hosted by Essential Media director Peter Lewis, there was an \u201cissue for permanent full-time and part-timers\u201d that emerged from a treasury briefing to Labor on Thursday.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re stood down, it\u2019s already the case that employers can say you\u2019ve got to use up your leave first, and they start running down your leave,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat it looks like will be possible is: if the employer gets the wage subsidy, instead of passing it through to you as a wage, they collect it and still have you running down your leave entitlements.\n\u201cSo effectively, instead of the government subsidising someone\u2019s wage, they\u2019re subsidising the balance sheet for an employer while the employer simply runs down all the leave entitlements of their employees.\u201d\nBurke said he was \u201cshocked\u201d and \u201cstunned\u201d by the revelation \u2013 because Labor thought the jobkeeper payment was \u201cmeant to flow through to the workers to give them an extra payment, not [flow] through as they collect entitlements they had already earned\u201d.\n\u201cIt might seem technical but there are hundreds of thousands, maybe millions, of permanent workers, who at the end of this will either have some of their leave entitlements or won\u2019t, based on whether this loophole survives.\u201d\nBurke said this was what the government was \u201ccurrently contemplating\u201d, although it \u201cmight not turn out this way in the legislation\u201d.\nLabor is also concerned that casuals with less than 12 months\u2019 service with their current employer \u2013 including many workers in retail and hospitality, teachers who move between schools, entertainment and arts workers on forward contracts and many construction workers \u2013 are set to miss out.\nUnveiling the jobkeeper payment on Monday, the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, said it was one of many measures to help \u201cbuild a bridge to the recovery\u201d by pursuing a \u201chibernation strategy\u201d.\n\u201cThis payment will give working Australians their best chance of keeping their job and keeping them connected to their employers so that they can bounce back in the recovery phase,\u201d he said.\nOn Thursday Porter summarised a raft of industrial relations reforms achieved \u201cbehind the scenes in a quiet and cooperative way\u201d between employers and unions.\nTemporary changes to the restaurant, hospitality and clerks award would change work conditions for 2m Australians during the Covid-19 crisis, allowing workers to move to perform another type of duty in another type of classification and facilitate working from home.\n\u201cRemarkably, some of the awards were so inflexible it was actually unlawful to work from home,\u201d Porter said. Some 103 modern awards would be changed to provide two weeks of unpaid pandemic leave for all employees, including casuals, and to allow employees to take double the duration of leave at half the pay, he said.\n\u201cNow, you can see how those common-sense changes would allow the flexibility in a number of businesses, which \u2026 could well make the difference between survival of the business and preservation of the jobs or the failure of the business and the loss of the jobs. So these are incredibly important changes.\u201d\nPorter thanked the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Australian Industry Group, other employer associations and unions and the president of the Fair Work Commission, justice Iain Ross.",

        "content": "Video by activists appears to show cruel treatment of weeks-old cattle transported on long journeys to Europe for veal\nFootage which appears to show Irish calves being beaten and kicked at a French feeding station has been published by animal campaign groups.\nThe video, published by Eyes on Animals (EoA) and French welfare organisation L214, appears to show workers repeatedly beating calves that are a few weeks old with sticks. One is kicked and another is dragged away, unable to stand. The calf was euthanised by a vet, said an EoA observer.\nIreland\u2019s dairy sector, which earned the country \u20ac4.4bn (\u00a33.9bn) in export revenues last year, relies heavily on veal farms in mainland Europe to buy unwanted male dairy calves. Dairy cows must produce calves in order to continue producing milk, but male calves are no use to the industry: they are known as \u201cshipping-calves\u201d in the Irish agricultural press.\nThe latest figures from Ireland\u2019s national agricultural body, Teagasc, show there are just over 1.4 million dairy cows in Ireland this year, each of which will calve once, producing approximately 700,000 male calves. Figures from the agriculture ministry show almost 247,000 cattle were exported from the country in 2018.\nLast month animal welfare campaigners followed calf trucks from the Irish port of Rosslare to the French port of Cherbourg. They documented a number of welfare and transport infractions.\nEU law obliges calf transporters to feed and rest calves after nine hours of travel, \u201c\u2018if necessary\u201d. After a second nine-hour journey, or a total of 18 hours\u2019 transport, calves must be fed and rested for 12 hours.\nBut Lesley Moffat of EoA said that from what her team had witnessed, \u201cincluding the time it takes to move calves to and from ports, plus a boat journey of about 18 hours, the calves had been on the road for an estimated 23 hours without milk or milk replacer, well above the legal maximum of 18 hours.\u201d\nCampaigners described the handling of calves on arrival at Couville, France, as brutal. \u201cThe four Irish trucks would be carrying about 1,200 calves and when they arrive, they\u2019re desperate for milk. The workers get impatient because they won\u2019t leave the feeders. Calves were kicked and whacked repeatedly, particularly around the head with sticks. We saw one collapse, either because of the brutality or because of exhaustion and hunger. Or both.\u201d\nA year ago the two groups covered calf mistreatment at another Cherbourg feeding facility, Qualivia. Moffat said the incidents could not be dismissed as isolated.\nThe groups also argued that the Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted dairy industry weaknesses. \u201cThe continuing export of Irish dairy calves is a welfare nightmare. It breaks a range of EU laws and increases the risk of infections and diseases being transferred from one country to another. There is no automatic quarantine for truckers. On this trip the drivers moved from Rosslare to France through Belgium, up to Holland, and then they go home,\u201d said Moffat.\nIn a statement, L214 described the transport of calves as \u201can ordeal\u201d in normal times, and, during the Covid-19 pandemic, \u201ctotally irresponsible\u201d. They called on the EU and the French agriculture ministry to \u201curgently stop\u201d veal transports.\nA lawyer for another welfare organisation, currently preparing a court case that could end unweaned calf exports from Scotland and possibly the rest of the EU, agreed about the welfare and disease risks.\n\u201cThis is why we\u2019re asking the Scottish courts to declare it unlawful to allow unweaned calves to be exported. If we win our case, it will hopefully have repercussions throughout the EU,\u201d said Peter Stevenson of Compassion in World Farming.\nStevenson said he was shocked to see the Scottish and UK governments preparing to defend calf exports by appointing Queen\u2019s Counsel barristers. He said the UK government and Boris Johnson, had \u201cboth said they want to end live exports\u201d, making their defence \u201chypocritical\u201d.\nContacted by the Guardian, the director of the feeding facility where the calf mistreatment was filmed, said the mistreatment allegedly shown in the video was \u201cnot possible\u201d but refused to comment further. A person who answered the Qualivia mobile number refused to identify themselves and said they had no further comment on the video of calf mistreatment filmed last year.\nIreland\u2019s Department of Food, Agriculture and the Marine emailed a statement saying it \u201ccontinues to undertake inspection/control activities and provide certification to the farming and food sectors, whilst respecting HSE [the Irish health service] public health guidance with regard to hygienic and social distancing protocols.\u201d\nThe statement also said that if \u201cthere is evidence of alleged non-compliances at a premises in France, anyone with such evidence should bring the matter immediately to the attention of the authorities there, who can investigate/respond as necessary\u201d.\nAt the time of publication, the French agriculture ministry had not responded to requests for comment.",

Tracking bracelets ensure people mandatorily isolating don\u2019t leave their homes.\nProf Ben Cowling, an epidemiologist at Hong Kong University\u2019s school of public health, said that while Hong Kong could claim to have prevented an epidemic so far, there was still a risk of one with incoming travellers.\nHong Kong never saw more than 11 cases confirmed in a day during the early stages of the outbreak. After thousands of people flew home the number is now regularly above 50, and the city\u2019s health system is strained.\nTaiwan\u2019s response to the pandemic is considered one of the world\u2019s most successful. It maintains a ban on foreign entrants, and with its infection rate still low \u2013 around 330 cases \u2013 is more focused on a spat with the World Health Organization.\nSingapore is also considered to be an example of best practice but is facing a potential second wave. Amid warnings of growing community \u201ccomplacency\u201d, all four of Singapore\u2019s deaths and more than 60% of its 1,000 or so confirmed cases have been in the past three weeks.\nSingapore has introduced fines and jail terms for breaching stay-at-home orders, banned all international short-term visitors and transits, cancelled mass gatherings, and closed venues, places of worship and tuition centres.\nThis week it announced all long term pass-holders needed approval before entering the country, and cancelled the passport of a citizen who flouted stay-at-home orders.\nJapan\u2019s daily case reports grew slowly over January and February, not reaching more than 50 until last month. While it has held off a major outbreak, Tokyo has become a concern, reporting record high case numbers for four consecutive days in late March.\nThe country\u2019s social distancing and lockdown measures appear far more lax than its neighbours and there has been accusations of under-testing and speculation the number of infected people is far higher than reported.\nSouth Korea was once one of the worst outbreak sites, but after implementing aggressive contact tracing, quarantining and isolation, it appeared to get control. Amid fears of a second wave, however, some health experts are calling for the country to extend its entry ban, currently one of the most lax in the region.\nIn mainland China the initial outbreak, which killed thousands, has slowed but there remains concern over people who returned home from abroad and foreigners, all of whom have been banned from entering, including those with residency visas. Restrictions have been lifted in Hubei but across the country people\u2019s movements are policed by a colour-coded health app.\nThis week authorities imposed lockdown on a Chinese county of 600,000 after a woman is thought to have contracted the virus from asymptomatic doctors at a hospital.\nA study in the Lancet Public Health Journal said the extreme restrictions on Wuhan helped control the outbreak, and lifting them now could see a second wave by August.\nDozens of new cases are reported daily in mainland China, almost all imported. However, there are accusations of coverups, and it was not until this week that Chinese health authorities included asymptomatic people who tested positive \u2013 estimated to be 18-31% of cases \u2013 among its reported number.\nChina\u2019s national health commission said that as of Tuesday, 20,000 people were under observation as possible silent carriers, and the president, Xi Jinping, on a visit to Zhejiang, called for more focus on asymptomatic cases.",

        "content": "Eddie Jones has agreed a contract extension as England\u2019s head coach through to the next World Cup. Jones\u2019s deal had been due to expire next year but he has now committed until France 2023 after discussions with the Rugby Football Union chief executive, Bill Sweeney.\nJones\u2019s long-term future had been uncertain since he guided England to their first World Cup final for 12 years last November. In the buildup to the tournament he had regularly hinted he would leave his role upon its completion but Sweeney acknowledged after the final defeat by South Africa that it \u201cmade sense\u201d for Jones to stay until 2023. The following month Sweeney insisted he was in \u201cno rush\u201d to tie Jones down for a further two years but negotiations continued and were concluded a few weeks ago with the announcement delayed by the coronavirus outbreak.\nJones said: \u201cThe extension is a great honour for me, but in the current environment, it is only right to acknowledge what a difficult time the world is facing. We are all looking forward to a time when we can get back to playing rugby and use the sport as a force for good in bringing people back together.\u201d\nIn the aftermath of the World Cup final, Jones had hinted he might not stay on until the next tournament, admitting it was \u201chard to kick stones for four years\u201d but insisted he would see out his contract until 2021. His initial deal was up until the 2019 World Cup but it was extended for another two years by the then RFU chief executive, Steve Brown, in January 2018, ensuring Jones would be available for the British & Irish Lions job. With Warren Gatland committing to another Lions tour, however, Jones has slowly but surely warmed to the idea of staying on as England\u2019s head coach.\nJones added: \u201cI never thought coming here four years ago I would be doing a second four years but the circumstances are right. We set out four years ago to be the best team in the world and unfortunately we missed that by 80 minutes. Now we want to be the team that is remembered as being the greatest team the game has ever seen. It\u2019s a big ambition but I believe we are capable of doing it.\u201d\nSweeney said: \u201cIn exceptionally difficult times, we are pleased to be sharing some good news. We are delighted Eddie will continue as head coach to run England\u2019s campaign to take us to the 2023 Rugby World Cup. His record since joining speaks for itself and he has proven why he is one of the best coaches in world rugby. The progress shown by England since 2015 has been indisputable and having fielded the youngest-ever team to play in a World Cup final, we know even more growth is possible. \n  \u201cWe reached an understanding soon after returning from Japan but there were some things that we wanted to make sure worked for both sides. We have announced Eddie\u2019s contract extension a few weeks later than planned as our focus was diverted to support the English rugby community during this difficult time.\u201d\nJones is in Japan but last week it was revealed he had agreed to cut his \u00a3750,000 salary by more than 25%, in line with Sweeney and the rest of the executive team, with the RFU forecasting losses of up to \u00a350m over the next 18 months.\nUnder his tenure England have won the Six Nations title twice \u2013 clinching the grand slam in 2016 \u2013 and were sitting top of the championship table before the postponements caused by the the coronavirus outbreak.",

        "content": "Phillipe Nover was trained to inflict damage on his opponents in the octagon. Now he is helping save lives in a city stricken by coronavirus\nAmong the steady stream of stretchers nurse practitioner Phillipe Nover saw pass through his New York City area hospital last weekend, the former UFC fighter was shocked to see a familiar face. It was another nurse around his age, a man Nover knew was as fit and healthy as himself, having spent many shifts working side by side with him.\n\u201cI can\u2019t breathe, man,\u201d he told Nover, as other gurneys buzzed past them and paper-gowned medical personnel hustled back and forth through a chaotic emergency room. Nover put on a brave face and wished his colleague well, trying to bury the thoughts that the virus currently sweeping through New York City could take him out as well.\nAt the hospital, Nover\u2019s has witnessed a lot of change since it was announced in mid-March that Covid-19 had come to the United States. For two weeks, Nover and his co-workers have been preparing for what they\u2019re calling \u201cthe apex\u201d, which is when the number of infections and deaths will reach their height.\n\u201cThey\u2019re saying in one to two weeks, we could have a healthcare system crash,\u201d says the 36-year-old Nover. \u201cThe tipping point is when we\u2019ll have to start deciding who gets the remaining ventilators. We\u2019re preparing for another Italy or Spain.\u201d\nTwo weeks ago, the staff slowly shut down non-essential services to save masks and gowns for the ER. Nover, who regularly works in cardiology, volunteered for the ER or ICU \u2013 he\u2019d worked in an ER from 2005 to 2008. The hospital initially designated half its ER an isolation area for Covid-19 patients, but the virus quickly disregarded those arrangements. The afflicted are everywhere now, spilling out into hallways lined with gurneys like neatly parallel-parked cars. Even critical care patients have been wheeled into the hallways, connected to bulky transport monitors. The ICU is now dedicated exclusively to Covid-19.\n\u201cIn the past, we\u2019ve had an influx of patients, but it always settles down for a bit where we can catch our breaths,\u201d said Nover. \u201cIt\u2019s not settling down here.\u201d\nExposure is a major topic of conversation among the medical staff. Covid-19 is highly contagious and like other hospitals around the country, personal protective equipment, like facemasks and gowns, is at a minimum and will likely run out at some point. Nover says the equipment is rationed and every nurse is told to write their names on everything in marker.\n\u201cI have all my protective equipment,\u201d said Nover. \u201cI don\u2019t mess around with protective gear. It\u2019s like I\u2019m in a sauna suit, cutting weight for a big fight.\u201d\nOnly two years ago, Nover was in the cage inflicting damage on his opponents, not tending to it. In 2008, Nover was a finalist during Season 8 of The Ultimate Fighter, the UFC\u2019s hit reality show that launched many a fighter\u2019s career. He didn\u2019t win the six-figure contract, but his performances secured him a spot in the UFC\u2019s featherweight division. During his 14-year mixed martial arts career, Nover had 23 professional fights \u2013 10 of them in the UFC.\nDuring his fighting career, Nover left nursing for a time, but later returned, balancing both careers the same way he had when he started fighting in 2003.\n\u201cI was a pretty physical kid and enrolled in every sport I could. Soccer. Baseball. Lots of team sports,\u201d says Nover. \u201cBoth of my parents wanted me to try martial arts and over time I began to like the one-on-one aspect of it over team sports.\u201d\nAt the age of nine, Nover was introduced to traditional martial arts like jeet kune do and kung fu. But when a friend told him about Brazilian jiu-jitsu in their teens, Nover was hooked after his first session. In just a couple of years, he earned his black belt under Alexandre \u201cSoca\u201d Freitas and he was recently awarded a rare third-degree stripe from the legendary Renzo Gracie.\nNover\u2019s father was a nurse for 30 years, a Patch Adams-type character who\u2019d gladly play the fool to get a laugh out of his patients. As a kid, Nover and his brother, also now a nurse, would dress up in scrubs from head to toe and practice playing doctor with one another.\n\u201cPutting on scrubs today like we did is not allowed, but when I wore it, I felt like a superhero,\u201d he says.\nAfter Nover graduated high school in 2002, his father said he would make a great nurse. \u201cMe being only 18, I told my dad that nursing was kind of a woman\u2019s thing, but he had a great reply,\u201d says Nover. \u201c\u2018There are a lot of women in the field,\u2019 my father said, \u2018and you get to work with a lot of them.\u2019\u201d\nNover was surprised how much he liked nursing school. \u201cI learned about the human body, which I was passionate about,\u201d he says. \u201cI was a martial artist. I wanted to not only learn about sick people, but healthy people and how to be in optimum health.\u201d\nAs a former professional athlete, Nover knows his health is better than most. That\u2019s why he volunteered to join the ER and ICU, where he believes he will contract the virus, if he hasn\u2019t already.\n\u201cI\u2019m very healthy. I eat right. I exercise. So why not go to the front line? There\u2019s a lot of nurses I work with who are older with family and kids. Some of them have overcome cancer or are managing diseases. A lot of the younger staff like me feel the same way. This is our calling. I never thought it would come to this, but this is what we signed up for.\u201d",

        "content": "New technology is helping expose the depth and breadth of biased language at a processing rate previously impossible for humans \nIf, during an election campaign, you heard one candidate described as \u201cbrave\u201d and another candidate described as \u201cstrong\u201d, which of the two would you be more likely to vote for? If the answer to this question seems obvious to you, that\u2019s because logically it is. But it also demonstrates the power of language to shape our thinking and influence our behaviour.\n\u201cGendered language is understood as language that has a bias towards a particular gender [and] reflects and maintains pre-existing social distinctions,\u201d explains Roxana Lupu, an expert in applied linguistics. It shows us two things \u2013 not only does it \u201csignal the presence of sexism in the society\u201d, but it also \u201creinforces those beliefs and perceptions\u201d. To put it simply: gendered language is that which promotes bias towards one gender, while simultaneously entrenching such bias further.\nFor a relatively new field of study in sociolinguistics (gendered language only rose to academic prominence in the 1970s), it has had no shortage of attention \u2013 emerging alongside second-wave feminism, it deepened the collective understanding of how gender discrimination is proliferated, both directly and indirectly.\nLupu believes the media plays a fundamental role in disseminating gendered language among the population. \u201cWe need to raise awareness to drive change,\u201d she says.\nBut raising awareness is hindered by a lack of information on just how big the problem is. That\u2019s where artificial intelligence (AI) comes in.\n\u201cNever before have we had the capability to analyse language in such a meaningful way at such massive scale,\u201d says Rich Wilson, owner of Deviance (a technology company that focuses on language analytics). \u201cThis represents a huge opportunity for broad areas such as cultural or gender research,\u201d he continues, which means that \u201cevidence is now indisputable and quantifiable rather than just anecdotal.\u201d\nIt was precisely this thinking that inspired a recent media coverage study conducted by a female-led marketing agency, Mac+Moore, with the support of Deviance. As marketeers, the brand\u2019s founders, Jess MacIntyre and Natalie Moores, spend a large portion of their time discussing the power of language and messaging with their clients. \u201cWe work closely with companies to craft and shape the way they communicate with their audience,\u201d Moores says, \u201cso we know better than most how language can be a very powerful and persuasive tool \u2013 and has the ability to shape people\u2019s perception.\u201d\nThe difference in the media\u2019s treatment of men and women is a topic that has been growing in coverage over the past decade. Savvy brands such as Gillette have been using their marketing campaigns to highlight \u2013 and challenge \u2013 gender discrimination and how it damages women. But Mac+Moore wanted to take this one step further. \u201cWe wanted to produce a data set that irrefutably demonstrated how gendered language is used in the media,\u201d says Moores, \u201cso that we had hard evidence that couldn\u2019t just be dismissed as \u2018an opinion\u2019.\u201d\nUsing a technique known as comparative linguistics (where two data sets are analysed in relation to one another), Deviance\u2019s software would enable them to analyse in a detailed way any linguistic differences in the way men and women are described in the source material. Not only this, but it would enable the analysis of articles by publications from all across the UK\u2019s media landscape at a volume higher than humans alone have ever been able to process \u2013 and in only a matter of hours. \u201cAI is perfect because it allows the analysis to be completely removed from any bias that we may have \u2013 it allows for complete neutrality,\u201d says MacIntyre.\n\u201cWe chose the Labour leadership race as source material because it\u2019s so topical and, what\u2019s more, there\u2019s never been a female leader of the party, but the odds of one being elected in this contest were four to one,\u201d says Moores. \u201cStatistically, it is more likely than ever that a woman will be elected, which would enable us to see with more clarity how gendered language is affecting the candidates\u2019 chances \u2013 for better or for worse.\u201d\nAnd so they fed 145,000 words through the software, sourced from recent coverage of all five candidates from a broad cross-section of the media\u2019s online content \u2013 amounting to 250 articles in total.\nThe results were startling: articles covering the only man in the race, Keir Starmer, were 4.4 times more likely to describe him using words meaning \u201cpreferred\u201d and \u201cfavoured\u201d, whereas the female candidates were 1.9 times more likely to be described using words such as \u201cbrave\u201d (arguably patronising in this context), \u201csad\u201d, \u201cviolent/angry\u201d, and \u201cdislike\u201d.\nMoreover, the results show that there is a huge focus on gender through the use of titles such as \u201cMs\u201d or \u201cMrs\u201d, which they were three times more likely to use for female candidates, whereas Starmer was referred to mostly by just his surname or the honorific \u201cSir\u201d, which holds a positive connotation. Finally, Starmer was 1.6 times more likely to be discussed in terms of professional employment, politics, law and order, and belonging to a group, whereas the female candidates were much more likely to be discussed in relation to their families and, particularly, their fathers.\nNot just this, but the web scraper tool used on the first analysis picked up the content of digital advertising on each website. \u201cThis revealed that whenever a female candidate was discussed, ads were served against the content for clothing, fashion and beauty,\u201d says MacIntyre. \u201cThis never happened for Keir Starmer \u2013 the adverts served in articles for him were much more gender neutral.\u201d This, they believe, indicates an entrenched data bias in the software used by digital ad services that could potentially influence who consumes the content, \u201cthe implication being that articles written about female candidates are only relevant for female readers\u201d, says MacIntyre.\n\u201cThere is strong evidence to support the theory that women are being portrayed and represented within the media in an overly negative and gendered way, which could be impacting the outcome of election campaigns,\u201d says Moores, \u201cand the implications of this are potentially huge both in politics but also wider society.\u201d\nThe two women are energised by the research and plan to use the results to push for companies to think more carefully about how content is presented. \u201cAlthough these results tell the story of one leadership election, the problem of gendered language is universal,\u201d says MacIntyre.\nMore than anything, the study demonstrates how AI can drive forward our awareness of the scale of the problem of gendered language: the first step to addressing the issue. \u201cThe media has a responsibility to contribute to an equal society,\u201d says Lupu. For Wilson, \u201cif AI can help to highlight a path to progress, then we should grasp that opportunity with both hands.\u201d MacIntyre agrees: \u201cAfter all, if the world is changing, why shouldn\u2019t our language change too?\u201d",

It is available to stream throughout April while theatres remain closed because of the coronavirus. Six-year-old Hilda and I are getting used to watching our own \u201cprivate theatricals\u201d at home during the shutdown. On the plus side: you can enjoy online theatre sprawled on the couch, noisily eating Twiglets and playing with the cat. On the downside? Hilda says she misses all the interaction or, as she puts it, \u201cthe \u2018Hello!\u2019 and the \u2018Welcome!\u2019\u201d\nShe loves this show\u2019s set, which has a toadstool, a Bambi-alike deer and is populated with cutout Christmas trees that look like iced biscuits. Joss Matzen\u2019s attractively designed chalet looks smart on screen, with its clean lines defined by pitch-black surrounds.\nCarl Cockram\u2019s Mr Rain and Simone Lewis\u2019s Mrs Sunshine take turns to leave their shared home and, apart from the briefest of encounters, are always alone. She delights in the garden, playing keepy-uppy with a floating feather; he plonks about catching raindrops in his hands. \u201cThey each have a time to be funny,\u201d laughs Hilda. There is hardly any dialogue and we\u2019re soon chatting much more than we would in a theatre. This makes a nice change: kids\u2019 minds race so quickly that they are often on to the next thing by the time you\u2019ve left the theatre and don\u2019t dwell on discussing the performance.\nWhen the couple start to look after a nest of birds (\u201cfluffy pompoms!\u201d cries Hilda), Gilly Baskeyfield\u2019s story and her jaunty production gently explore themes of family and shared responsibilities, which is useful at this lockdown time when we\u2019re all striving to get along in the same space. Mr Rain\u2019s drainpipe contraption, and his tricks with differently coloured water, may inspire some postshow activities at home and M6\u2019s website has its own downloadable resource pack and story book too.\nWhatever the Weather should help children see the world a little differently on their daily trip outside or recognise that every day comes with sunny and rainy feelings even if you stay indoors. There are no prizes for guessing what happens at the end, when Mr Rain and Mrs Sunshine stay outdoors together, but really the whole show is a rainbow, full of delightfully sweet magic.\nAvailable online until 30 April.",

Cuomo said no, but McLaughlin took matters into his own hands by issuing a public health order \u2013 anyone arriving from the city must contact local officials immediately.\nThose arriving will then be subject to a 14-day quarantine, and will be checked on daily by law enforcement or health professionals. It remains to be seen if this will calm locals\u2019 fears about New Yorkers spreading infection.\n\u201cYou get a lot of people who are just plain scared who say: \u2018Keep them out, keep them out,\u2019\u201d McLaughlin said.\n\u201cI take the more middle-of-the-road approach.

The vigilantes chopped down a tree and laid it across a driveway, in an attempt to barricade the alleged visitors in their home.\nAs it turns out, the people subjected to the locals\u2019 tree felling weren\u2019t even from out of town \u2013 they were a group of three men who had been renting the house since summer while working nearby \u2013 but the New Jersey license plate on their vehicle was enough to trigger the locals.\nThe vigilante behavior triggered condemnation.\n\u201cThis is not something to be celebrated,\u201d said Genevieve McDonald, a member of the Maine house of representatives. \u201cNow is not the time to develop or encourage an \u2018us vs them\u2019 mentality. Targeting people because of their license plates will not serve any of us well.\u201d\nTo the east of New York City, towns in the Hamptons \u2013 a traditional escape for wealthy city dwellers \u2013 have seen their populations surge. Southampton has seen its population grow in recent weeks from 60,000 to 100,000.\nIn some area of the Hudson Valley and in the Catskills, north of New York City, rental prices have quadrupled as people flee the city.\nLocals in these communities argue their hostility is not simply parochialism. Many harbor concerns about the ability of rural communities to manage an outbreak, given shortages of medical supplies, stretched hospitals and less access to food and groceries.\nIt isn\u2019t just states to the north of New York that are seeing a surge of outsiders. At the end of March New Jersey\u2019s governor, Phil Murphy, pleaded with people not to travel to homes in the popular Jersey Shore area, after locals complained about the influx of New Yorkers.\nSome places have taken more drastic measures. In March the island of North Haven, in Maine, banned all visitors, even those who own holiday homes.\n\u201cThis was never about an us-vs-them-mentality,\u201d Rick Lattimer, North Haven\u2019s town administrator, told Politico. \u201cIt was about the fact that we are nowhere ready to handle an influx of people and their needs.\u201d\nDespite those pleas, a defensive mentality does seem to have sprung up in many areas, and it is difficult to see when it will recede.\n\u201cPeople need to stop coming out east. We\u2019re full,\u201d one woman opined on the East Hampton Star Facebook page.\n\u201cWatching people out there playing tennis in [Amagansett] on my way home from my essential job was infuriating. This is not a frikkin\u2019 vacation. All that talk of the us v them and us playing nice, to score the summer bucks \u2026 pssh.\u201d",

        "content": "Border closures and strict lockdowns have led to a steep decline in the number of migrants coming from Central America\nWhen Angelica turned 30, she realized there was no future for her in Honduras.\nAlthough she had a college degree, she was still living paycheck to paycheck and was stuck in a neighborhood of the capital Tegucigalpa ruled by violent gangs.\nSo, after years contemplating migration to the US where she has relatives, she finally made arrangements to depart.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to stay in a neighborhood where there are massacres or where the people lock themselves in their homes at six at night because the gangs impose a curfew,\u201d she said. \u201cI realized I was more surviving than living.\u201d\nBut by the time she was due to start her journey north, Honduras had closed its borders and declared a state of emergency. She could no longer leave her city \u2013 much less take a bus to northern Guatemala, to meet a coyote who would guide her through Mexico.\n\u201cI had thought that only a hurricane could stop me,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I hadn\u2019t thought of a pandemic.\u201d\nBorder closures and strict lockdowns prompted by the Covid-19 crisis have disrupted the migrant trail through Central America and Mexico, forcing some would-be migrants to postpone their journeys \u2013 and stopping many others in their tracks.\nThe result has been a deterrent more effective than any wall Donald Trump could build.\nActivists across the region have reported a steep decline in the number of migrants coming from Central America since the restrictions were implemented. One Mexican shelter near the Guatemalan border said it hadn\u2019t received a new arrival in a week.\n\u201cThe crisis has facilitated Trump\u2019s policies because [Central American] migrants can\u2019t even leave their countries,\u201d said Sister Nyzella Juliana Dond\u00e9, coordinator of a Catholic migrant aid organization in Honduras.\nEl Salvador closed its borders on 11 March, and the governments of Guatemala and Honduras quickly followed suit. All three countries in the so-called northern triangle have since announced internal lockdowns of differing strictness.\nThe three nations had recently signed \u201csafe third country agreements\u201d with the US government under which they agreed to increase enforcement on their borders, and receive migrants who had transited their country on the way to the US.\nOnly Guatemala had begun to implement the new measures, but it announced on 17 March that it would suspend the deportations of Hondurans and Salvadorans from the US to its territory.\nBut Guatemala and Honduras continued to receive deportation flights bringing their own citizens from the US \u2013 despite concerns that the practice could accelerate the spread of the virus.\nIn the past week, a migrant who was deported from the US to Guatemala was diagnosed with Covid-19 and a group of deportees to Honduras escaped from the shelter where they were to be quarantined. Guatemala has now requested that the US suspend deportation flights.\nMeanwhile, migrants who were already en route have been left exposed by the closure of shelters and the difficulties facing humanitarian organizations which would normally attend to them.\n\u201cThey are in a vulnerable situation because the guidance is to stay at home \u2013 but the migrants don\u2019t have homes,\u201d said Dond\u00e9, who mentioned a case of a large group of Haitian and African migrants who were detained after crossing into Guatemala from Honduras amid the lockdown. \u201cNeither Honduras or Guatemala wanted to offer them a place to stay.\u201d\nMigrants who already had arrived to Mexico have been left in limbo by the US government\u2019s decision to immediately return all migrants from Mexico and Central America who cross into the country irregularly along the south-west border.\nWhen restrictions are eventually eased, a fresh surge in migration seems likely: multiple would-be migrants who spoke with the Guardian said it was only a question of when, not if, they would set out for the US.\nAnd the economic impact of the crisis may in turn cause others to migrate.. \u201cBefore many people migrated because they lacked work and a dignified life,\u201d said Silva de Souza. \u201cNow there will be many more.\u201d\nMigrants who have come from even farther afield, have no choice but to try to push on. Mohamed left Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, in 2018, following the well-trodden migrant path via Ecuador, Colombia and the jungles of Panama. He was burning through his savings and racking up debt, but making steady progress north.\nBut he reached Guatemala just before the government announced a state of emergency which has made moving on impossible.\n\u201cTravel has become very difficult,\u201d he said in a brief exchange via Facebook Messenger. But he was still determined to reach the US \u2013 even if he now has to move more carefully \u2013 traveling at night and avoiding large caravans. \u201cWith God\u2019s will, I\u2019ll get there. I will build a life of opportunity.\u201d\nAdditional reporting by Joe Parkin Daniels",

        "content": "Film-maker known for his world music documentaries, in particular his Beats of the Heart series\nJeremy Marre, who has died aged 76, was a British documentary maker specialising in films about popular music of every possible kind. Widely travelled, and with eclectic taste, he had a lengthy career that included adventurous documentaries about music in Africa, the Americas, the UK and the US, and profiles of artists such as Phil Spector, Roy Orbison, Youssou N\u2019Dour and Count Basie.\nHis first major success was Roots Rock Reggae (1977), which grew out of an earlier commission on the British reggae scene for the ITV arts programme Aquarius. Deciding that he needed to go to Jamaica to fully understand the music, Marre \u201cscraped together some money\u201d and travelled to Kingston, filming in lawless areas of the city. Threatened by some locals who accused him of being a CIA agent, he convinced them he was English only after they quizzed him about cricket. He returned with historic footage of artists including Bob Marley, Sly & Robbie and Jimmy Cliff, but still had difficulty in placing the film. As Marre explained in an interview with fRoots magazine in 2014, \u201cthe BBC said it was boring, and you can\u2019t mix music and politics, while PBS in America turned it down as communist propaganda. But it won a documentary prize at Cannes and then the BBC wanted to show it. It was different to anything, with no presenter and no commentary.\u201d It is now regarded as a classic film of the genre.\nMark Cooper, the former head of music television at the BBC, who worked with Marre on many of his films from 2005 on, called him \u201cone of the key architects of the \u2018rockumentary\u2019 and music films\u201d. \u201cWhat all his films had in common,\u201d Cooper said, \u201cwas great journalism, a desire to listen to the artist and a desire to give voice to the artist.\u201d\nMarre also had a knack of being in the right place at the right time. As a result he did not just chronicle popular music history, but helped to make it. He was in South Africa during the apartheid era, where he filmed black musicians long before the growing interest in world music brought them popularity in the west. Among those featured in Rhythm of Resistance (1979) was the Zulu choir Ladysmith Black Mambazo. Paul Simon saw Marre\u2019s film and was so impressed that he decided to record with the group and other black South African musicians \u2013 and the result was his acclaimed 1986 album Graceland.\nAlbert Mazibuko, the group\u2019s eldest surviving member, said: \u201cEveryone points to our work with Paul Simon as the moment we became well known around the world. However most people do not realise that if it wasn\u2019t for Jeremy Marre and his Rhythm of Resistance documentary, Paul Simon would never have known there was a Ladysmith Black Mambazo.\u201d\nSimon \u2013 with whom Marre would work later on a film about Graceland \u2013 said: \u201cJeremy had a deep curiosity and knowledge of a great deal of interesting music around the planet.\u201d\nBorn in north London to Ivan Marre, a consultant dermatologist, and his Russian-born wife, Olga (nee Shlain), Jeremy was educated at Highgate school, north London. He graduated from University College London in law in 1965 and started reading for the bar before deciding he was more interested in film than law. He studied for an MA in film at the Royal College of Art but quit, finding it \u201cpretentious\u201d, and moved to the Slade School\u2019s film department, where he was \u201chappier \u2026 you could do what you wanted\u201d.\nHe then took \u201codd jobs, from camera assistant to trainee assistant floor manager\u201d, to build up his expertise and get a union card. In 1970 he received a BFI grant to make a short film inspired by Charles Dickens\u2019s Pickwick Papers, Uneasy Dreams: The Life of Mr Pickwick.\nThrough his company, Harcourt Films, from the mid-70s Marre set out to film the music of the world for a series that would be branded Beats of the Heart. Over seven years he made 14 one-hour films, including Roots Rock Reggae and Rhythm of Resistance, that explored, as Marre put it, \u201cthe dynamic and often controversial role music plays within distinctive societies around the world \u2026 This music, sometimes called world music, is \u2013 in the words of reggae singer Jimmy Cliff \u2013 \u2018the cry of the people\u2019.\u201d\nThe series covered popular music styles from Latin to Nigerian, Gypsy and Chinese. For Shotguns and Accordions (1983) he travelled to the marijuana-growing areas of Colombia. Many of the films were shown on Channel 4, all of them were released on DVD and video, and they were accompanied by Marre\u2019s book of the same name.\nMarre made his reputation through world music films but moved on to cover a wide range of subjects. His prolific output included The Left-Handed Man of Madagascar (1990), which explored ancestor spirit festivals and which won a New York film festival award, and On The Edge (1992), a four-hour C4 series on improvised music from around the world. Reigning in Hell (2006) investigated the feared American prison gang the Aryan Brotherhood. Marre also tackled more conventional subjects, such as with Classic Albums, a series that spanned 1997 to 2018, but always retained a distinctive film-making style. \nTowards the end of his career, Marre made a series of profiles of musical celebrities, such as Otis Redding (2013) and Count Basie (2018). He used as little voiceover and commentary as possible, and never appeared in his own films, but instead used such techniques as getting an actor to voice the artist\u2019s diaries. \u201cHe liked the films to breathe \u2026 and the subjects and contributors and archive to speak,\u201d said Cooper. He was good at \u201cwinning the trust of his subjects because he was genuinely interested in them\u201d. So he was able to persuade Redding\u2019s wife and daughter to contribute to his profile, and discovered unseen archive from Count Basie\u2019s estate \u201cthat gives a sense of Basie the man and the human being \u2013 and that\u2019s vintage Jeremy\u201d, said Cooper.\nThe singer Pauline Black of the British Ska revival band The Selecter, who was involved in Marre\u2019s programmes Soul Britannia (2007) and Reggae Britannia (2011), said that \u201cJeremy\u2019s singular skill was allowing British black folks to tell our own story in our own words\u201d.\nMarre even made an impression on \u201cthe godfather of soul\u2019\u201d, James Brown. Marre\u2019s son Oliver recalled going to a Brown concert with his father when he was a teenager \u201cand JB stopped the show and shone a spotlight on my dad. \u2018Ladies and Gentlemen,\u2019 he mumbled, \u2018there are few men you can trust in this world. This man is one of them.\u2019\u201d\nMarre married Diana Silman, a teacher, in 1970 and she accompanied him on many of his early filming trips. She survives him, as do their two sons, Oliver and Jesse, and four grandchildren.\n Jeremy Peter Marre, film-maker, born 7 October 1943; died 15 March 2020",

In the next few days we will reach one million confirmed cases and 50,000 deaths.\u201d The total number of cases on Thursday was just below 936,000 with more than 47,000 deaths.\nOn Wednesday evening, Donald Trump warned of \u201cdifficult days\u201d for the US, saying: \u201cWe are going to have a couple of weeks, starting pretty much now, but especially a few days from now, that are going to be horrific.\u201d\nHe again questioned China\u2019s reported numbers on the virus: \u201cThe numbers seem to be a little bit on the light side \u2013 and I am being nice when I say that \u2013 relative to what we witnessed and what was reported.\u201d\nThe comments followed a Bloomberg news story that said a classified US intelligence report had concluded that China had under-reported the total cases and deaths it had suffered. On Wednesday \u2013 the last day of available figures \u2013 China reported 82,361 confirmed cases and 3,316 deaths.\nTrump\u2019s warning came as the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) reportedly asked US defence agencies for 100,000 body bags, for use by civilian authorities. The White House has previously said deaths could reach 240,000.\nThe United States has reported 213,000 confirmed cases \u2013 more than 20% of cases globally. Their death toll stands at 5,119.\nThe rapid growth in the number of infections has overwhelmed hospitals in many cities. A week ago the US Centers for Disease Control said there were 85,000 cases. That means recorded cases have grown by two and a half times in a week, and up from 15,219 two weeks ago.\nIn Europe, the three worst-affected countries \u2013 Italy Spain and Germany \u2013 represent just under a third of the confirmed cases worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University figures. Their combined death tolls make up 44% of fatalities worldwide.\nSpain hit another grim milestone on Thursday, as the number of deaths passed 10,000 and yet another record single-day death toll of 950 was recorded. However, while the total number of cases in the country rose to 110,238, the spread of the disease appears to be continuing to slow during the so-called \u201cstabilisation phase\u201d.\nIn Italy there is growing concern over social unrest, three weeks into its lockdown. Tensions in some of the poorest southern regions of Campania, Calabria, Sicily and Puglia have mounted, as people in some areas began to run out of food and money.\nMeanwhile Russia posted its largest single-day rise in identified cases. Officials said they had identified 771 new cases in the past day, a 28% rise from the previous day. Nearly 600 of the new cases were in Moscow, which has been the Russian city hit hardest by the crisis, with 2,475 confirmed cases. So far, 30 people have died, official statistics report.\nOther coronavirus developments included:\nTrump admitted his government\u2019s emergency stockpile of protective equipment was nearly exhausted because of the extraordinary demands of the coronavirus pandemic, as the US reported 884 deaths in one day. He also said the US \u201chad to help\u201d the two coronavirus-stricken cruise liners approaching Florida.\nBritish Airways is expected to announce the suspension of 36,000 staff, according to the BBC.\nBrazil confirmed its first indigenous case of Covid-19, a 20-year-old woman deep in the Amazon rainforest.\nRodrigo Duterte, the Philippines president, urged police to kill those violating virus lockdown measures. \u201cIf there is trouble or the situation arises that people fight and your lives are on the line, shoot them dead,\u201d he said. His threat follows the arrest of 21 people who had apparently taken to the streets to demand help.\nSouth Korea reported 89 new coronavirus cases, slightly lower than the 100-case average over the last three weeks, bringing the country\u2019s total to 9,976.\nIsraeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is returning to self-isolation for another six days after his health minister was diagnosed with coronavirus.",

Customers will be able to order up to 20 items for same-day delivery.\nSainsbury\u2019s expects to be able to serve up to 3,500 customers a week from the Blackfriars store and is recruiting more riders to help deliver orders. The supermarket is expected to roll out the service to other sites if it proves popular.\nThe service is part of Sainsbury\u2019s efforts to find new ways to expand home delivery to meet a massive shift in demand since the onset of the pandemic.\nIn normal times, the UK buys less than 7% of its groceries online but demand from households trying to avoid physical stores is far outstripping the ability of supermarkets to deliver.\nGrocery spending online rose 13% in the three months to 22 March, with 14.6% of households receiving an online delivery in the past four weeks, up from less than 14% a year before. The data analysis firm Kantar said proportion was \u201cprobably well below actual demand\u201d.\nThe surge in demand has led to a raft of new initiatives from grocers including the launch of emergency box schemes from Marks & Spencer and Morrisons.\nTesco has added more than 200 vans and recruited 2,500 drivers and more than 5,000 pickers to help it add more than 100,000 extra delivery slots for groceries.\nA string of local delivery schemes has also been launched by independent retailers, food makers and wholesalers.",

        "content": "Moving summit gives world time to respond to coronavirus and may allow a new US leader to join talks\nGreen campaigners and climate leaders have vowed to keep up the pressure on governments around the world to make stringent new commitments on the climate crisis, as a vital UN climate summit was delayed until next year because of the coronavirus pandemic.\nThe Cop26 talks were scheduled to take place this November in Glasgow, but the UK hosts won a delay on Wednesday night from the UN and other nations, after weeks of speculation the talks would be cancelled.\nMoving the 26th conference of the parties to an as yet unspecified new date next year gives countries time to work out their responses to the Covid-19 emergency, which experts hope will include commitments on shifting to a low-carbon economy rather than propping up the fossil fuel industry.\n\u201cThere is an opportunity in the recovery from the Covid-19 crisis to create a new approach to [economic] growth that is a sustainable and resilient economy in closer harmony with the natural world,\u201d said Nicholas Stern, one of the world\u2019s leading climate economists. \u201cThat will be the challenge and opportunity of Cop26 next year. We must use this time well.\u201d\nCurrent commitments under the Paris agreement are insufficient to meet its aims of holding the world to no more than 2C \u2013 and preferably no more than 1.5C \u2013 of heating, beyond which the impacts of climate breakdown are likely to become catastrophic and irreversible. The UK, as host of the Cop26 talks, is still aiming for all countries to come forward with fresh targets on their greenhouse gas emissions.\nThe EU pledged it would sustain its push for a bloc-wide \u201cgreen deal\u201d that would involve stiffer cuts in emissions and a target of net zero emissions by 2050. Frans Timmermans, the vice-president of the European commission, said: \u201cWe will not slow down our work domestically or internationally to prepare for an ambitious Cop26.\u201d\nA clear benefit of moving the talks is that their original start date of 9 November was days after the US presidential election. That timing posed problems for negotiators, because Donald Trump has begun the process of withdrawing the US from the Paris accord, a decision that will take legal effect on 4 November.\nSome observers are hoping that a new president could change the course of the world\u2019s most powerful economy and second biggest emitter. \u201cAmerican voters are increasingly likely to reject Trump\u2019s science denial on both coronavirus and climate change and instead elect Joe Biden president,\u201d said Paul Bledsoe, a former climate adviser in Bill Clinton\u2019s White House, now with the Progressive Policy Institute in Washington. \u201cDelaying Cop26 until 2021 means that Biden might have the chance to re-establish US climate leadership.\u201d\nWhether or not there is a change of administration, the delay has an advantage for countries negotiating with the US, said Nathaniel Keohane, a senior vice president at the Environmental Defense Fund in the US.\n\u201cUnder the original schedule, the Cop was going to be overshadowed by the US elections regardless of the outcome,\u201d explained Keohane. \u201cThe shift in schedule will allow countries to react and respond. If a Democrat wins in November, then by the time of the Cop, the US will have re-entered Paris and will be able to send a high-level political delegation, giving an important and positive boost to the talks. And if Trump is re-elected, other countries will have had time to absorb that information by the time of the Cop and know definitively that they have to move on without the US.\u201d\nThis will be the first year in nearly three decades of annual climate negotiations under the 1992 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change that no talks are held.\nHowever, given the scale of the coronavirus crisis, by the end of a nearly four-hour meeting on Wednesday it was clear a decision had to be made quickly. Questions were raised over the potential problems with a postponement, in delaying vital work by countries on their emissions plans, but none of the parties objected to the final decision.\nIt may take months for a new date for Cop26 to be decided, with hopes that it could take place in early spring at the soonest. The UK is still committed to holding the summit in Glasgow, and is working with the Scottish government on logistics, and with its scientific advisers on when might be safe to hold a summit in which it is hoped civil society and activists will play a key role.\nFor now, the immediate goal of green campaigners is to ensure that recovery plans from the coronavirus crisis do not entrench investment in high emissions. There is a danger that some countries are using the pandemic to roll back environmental protections and commitments \u2013 in the US, for instance, the Trump administration has revoked clean car standards and in the EU, carmakers have lobbied for a watering down of their emissions obligations.\n\u201cCop26 being put on hold should make governments double down on their efforts to ensure a green and just way forward in handling this health crisis and the climate emergency,\u201d said Jennifer Morgan, the executive director of Greenpeace International. \u201cGoing back to business as usual is completely unacceptable: this pandemic shows there are huge lessons to be learned about the importance of listening to science and the need for urgent collective global action.\u201d",

So, that is a notorious spot for gulls anyway.\u201d\nThough as yet there has been no evidence of an increase in attacks, the spokesman added: \u201cWe are quite concerned that it may become a problem, with birds dive-bombing and chips being taken from your hand.\u201d\nThe council is warning visitors to stay away. \u201cOur message is please don\u2019t go to the coast this weekend. Local residents can do their daily exercise on the seafront, he added, but if they do, don\u2019t have fish and chips in your hand.\n\u201cHerring gulls are creatures of habit and they pass their local knowledge on to their young. So, if we can adopt this behaviour now, and have a generation of young gulls who haven\u2019t relied on human food, then theoretically it could be possible to break the cycle, and in future people would be more able to eat on the seafront without being mugged. That is a positive to come out of this.\u201d\nPeter Rock, an expert on urban gulls and a research associate at the University of Bristol, said the gulls would still find food. \u201cThey are very, very resourceful.\n\u201cThe large gulls know everything there is to know about everything within their home range. It behoves the sensible gull to know where to get food, exactly when, and how; where dustbins are being emptied into dustcarts, when black plastic bin bags are going out on to the street,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we are going to see too much in the way of increased aggression to the one person walking around with a pasty in his hand in Cornwall. They are not all going to pile in and attack this one person. Because apart from staying alive, the most important thing a gull can do in its life is breed. If it gets involved in some kind of scrap, the possibility is it might get damaged. And that\u2019s almost certainly the end of this year\u2019s breeding career, and very likely the end of its life. So they are very prudent.\u201d",

        "content": "Available onlineAhamefule J Oluo\u2019s 2014 show about having an autoimmune disease is a moving hybrid of comedy, theatre and jazz\nSince venues closed their doors because of the coronavirus, a wealth of online theatre has emerged and the industry is finding quick, creative ways to bring the stage to screen. But alongside the new, it is worth diving into the archives to find buried treasure.\nAhamefule J Oluo\u2019s innovative show Now I\u2019m Fine is one such gem. Originally staged at Seattle\u2019s Moore theatre in 2014, and streaming at OntheBoards.tv, it has been dubbed a \u201cstandup big-band autobiography\u201d for its original, hybrid form. It feels new in content too, speaking to our precarious times and bolstering the spirit.\nThings could always get worse, Oluo reminds us. Our skin could flay itself and fall off, leaving us as raw on the outside as it did him. His experience with a rare autoimmune disease came after the death of his father alongside divorce and debt, and it makes a potent metaphor for being stripped of all that is vital: \u201cThe thing that literally holds me together as a human being began to fall apart.\u201d It also left Oluo, a musician and comedian, in his own confinement, unable to see at first or play his trumpet or piano.\nThe show begins with standard standup comedy, whimsical in tone, as Oluo speaks of his white American mother from Kansas and his Nigerian father who left when he was a baby. He is funny and observant on teen masculinity and mixed heritage (he describes the meaning of his illustrious Nigerian name and then bathetically reveals his middle name is \u201cJoe\u201d) and touches on the scars his father\u2019s estrangement left.\nBut Now I\u2019m Fine, co-written by Oluo and Lindy West (also his wife), is far from standard fare and a confluence of forms kick in, which combine cabaret with experimental pop opera, standup and dramatic memoir.\nOluo is a sure but gentle storyteller who does not strain for effect and the autobiographical format for his standup, which could so easily fall prey to solipsism, never feels self-indulgent. Gradually it gets darker, but these emotional nadirs are never milked. There is a steady pace to Oluo\u2019s delivery and a note of understatement. This restraint only gives his story more power and the jazz-infused music heightens emotions as he spirals into illness, depression and despair.\nThere is a live 17-piece orchestra behind him and mesmerising vocals from Okanomod\u00e9; Oluo\u2019s words weave with the music to become a live dynamic in instances when a violin or trumpet begins to play as a melancholy memory is recalled, but this accompaniment is not obvious or overplayed.\nAn emotionally arresting moment comes when he stops mid-sentence and lets the music describe a memory that is too devastating to be articulated, so that we never know its details in words but hear its trauma through orchestral sound.\nThe power of this show is built slowly and devastatingly but we end in a place of resilience, if not recovery. \u201cIt\u2019s about finding a way to feel OK when you know that things are very not OK,\u201d he says. Now I\u2019m Fine is a show for our time and this parting wisdom is a gift.\nAvailable online, at OntheBoards.tv",

        "content": "Most taxpayers will get a check from the $2tn economic package, the largest in US history\nThe US has agreed on a $2tn stimulus package, the largest economic stimulus in US history, in response to the economic impacts of Covid-19. While corporations will be the biggest recipients of the bailout, some of that money will be paid directly to Americans hit by the pandemic.\nMost taxpayers will get a check in the mail, while those directly affected by the economic effects of Covid-19 are slated to receive robust government support.\nHere\u2019s what we know so far about how the new stimulus package will directly affect Americans in the coming weeks:\nCongress will spend about $250bn for checks up to $1,200 per person that will go directly to taxpayers.\nTo be eligible for the full amount, a person\u2019s most recently filed tax return must show that they made $75,000 or under. For couples, who can receive a maximum of $2,400, the cutoff is $150,000.\nIf a person makes more than $75,000, the amount given goes down incrementally by $5 for every $100 increase in salary. So a person who makes $85,000 would get $700 while a person who makes $95,000 would get $200.\nIf a person makes above $99,000, or a couple makes above $198,000, no check will be given.\nThere are some requirements and exceptions. Those getting a check must be living and working in the US and have a valid social security number. If a person is listed as a dependent on their parents\u2019 tax return \u2013 the case for many college students \u2013 they are excluded.\nThe Tax Foundation, a DC-based thinktank, estimates that 93.6% of Americans will be eligible for a check coming from the stimulus package.\nTaxpayers will be given $500 per child 16 or under listed as a dependent on their latest tax return.\nThat is still unclear. Experts say that Americans will probably not get the money until May, given how long it takes the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to send out checks. The treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said those whose bank account information is already with the IRS from previous tax returns can expect a payment \u201cwithin three weeks\u201d.\nFor those who still need to give the IRS their bank account information, a web-based portal will be opening soon to allow people to provide the IRS with their information. The IRS says this is to make sure people get their checks immediately, instead of sending them through the mail.\nThis is not the first time the government has sent checks to Americans. The federal government gave up to $300 in 2001 and $600 in 2008 to taxpayers who met a certain income bracket to similarly stimulate the economy.\nThe IRS recommends people file their 2018 or 2019 tax return as soon as possible to get the payment. A check will be sent to any qualified person so long as they file their return within 2020.\nA person may still be eligible even if they do not file the taxes. The IRS says people who typically do not file taxes \u2013 low-income taxpayers and some veterans \u2013 will need to file a \u201csimple tax return\u201d in order to get the payment. Social security beneficiaries will not need to fill out the tax return, even if they do not file their taxes, to get the payment.\nYes, specifically the bill will increase unemployment insurance by $600 for 13 weeks \u2013 about four months \u2013 for every person, added to the existing unemployment compensation a person gets from their state\u2019s program.\nThe length and amount of compensation varies from state to state. A majority of states providing a maximum of 26 weeks of compensation, while average weekly compensation ranges from 20% of a person\u2019s wage to just over 50%.\nWhile unemployment insurance typically does not cover people who are self-employed \u2013 freelancers, contractors and gig workers \u2013 the bill comes with a \u201cpandemic unemployment assistance\u201d measure that will extend insurance to those workers.\nNot in this bill. Earlier last week, Donald Trump signed the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, a bill worth about $100bn meant to expand paid sick leave and emergency paid leave, but it came with major loopholes. Companies with over 500 employees were not mentioned in the bill, while companies with under 50 employees can apply for exemptions.\nThe bill mandates 10 days of fully paid sick leave for employees of companies with 500 employees or less. Parents of those companies affected by their children\u2019s school closing and those leaving for medical reasons can get 12 weeks of pay at 67% of their salary.\nAgain, not in this bill. The Families First Coronavirus Response Act included a measure that mandated all Covid-19 testing is free, but treatment for any symptoms (there is currently no cure for the illness) still comes at a cost.\nA few states have reopened enrollment for their health insurance programs to allow those concerned about costs to enroll, and three major health insurance companies said they will be waiving any high costs for treatment, but there are still stories of people getting bills for as much as $34,000 to cover treatment of the virus\u2019s symptoms.",

It also remains within the UK\u2019s customs territory to allow it to benefit from any future trade deals secured by the British government. But the full EU customs code has to be enforced on goods travelling between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. All goods deemed at risk of travelling from Northern Ireland into the Republic of Ireland would attract tariffs.\nThe messy compromise allowed for the avoidance of a border on the island of Ireland but brings with it a host of potential flash points.\nThe issue of a Belfast office was raised on Monday during the first teleconference meeting of the EU-UK joint committee, set up to supervise the operation of the withdrawal agreement. The chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Michael Gove, is the UK\u2019s senior figure on the committee.\nUnder article 12 of the Northern Ireland protocol, the UK government is \u201cresponsible for implementing and applying the provisions of [EU] law\u201d but EU officials \u201cshall have the right to be present during any activities\u201d relating to checks and controls.\nThe UK is obliged to \u201cfacilitate such presence of representatives and shall provide them with the information requested\u201d. The EU wants a base for its customs and veterinary experts.\nA European commission spokesman said: \u201cWe can confirm that we have sent letters to the UK regarding a proposal to open a technical office in Belfast with specific technical capabilities to ensure the implementation of the protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland. This issue was raised in the joint committee on Monday. We remain in contact with the UK on this point.\u201d\nA cross-party group of members of the Northern Ireland assembly has written to the prime minister backing the commission\u2019s proposal.\nMichelle O\u2019Neill of Sinn F\u00e9in, who is the deputy first minister of Northern Ireland, along with the leaders of the Greens, the Social Democratic and Labour party and the Northern Ireland Alliance, wrote: \u201cAs party leaders representing a majority of citizens who voted to remain within the EU, we feel strongly that an office in Belfast is necessary to ensure the implementation of the protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland which you negotiated with the EU \u2026\n\u201cTo oppose the opening of such an office by the EU in Belfast represents an act of bad faith by your government and a breach of trust at this critical stage of the process.\u201d\nA spokesman for the UK government said it was considering the issue. He said: \u201cWe received an initial request from the EU and responded to decline the proposal in February. We have since received a follow-up letter to which we will respond in due course.\u201d",

He worked closely with several colourful Dales characters, who became family friends; and with Joan Maynard, the indefatigable advocate of agricultural workers, who later became a prominent leftwing Labour MP.\nIn 1970, Roger was appointed to the department of adult education and extramural studies at the University of Leeds: later, he became responsible, as head of department, for all the liberal adult education work of the school of continuing education. Roger was committed to a \u201csocial purpose\u201d perspective on adult education: \u201ca democratic, dialectical and non-utilitarian approach\u201d, as he put it. He aimed to provide \u201cindividuals with the knowledge which they can use collectively to change society if they so wish\u201d, with a particular focus upon enabling working-class students to \u201cchallenge the inequalities and injustices of society in order to bring about radical social change\u201d.\nAmong his many publications, A History of Modern British Adult Education (1996) remains the standard text; he wrote a definitive history of the British anti-apartheid movement (2005); and he and I co-edited EP Thompson and English Radicalism (2013).\nRoger was born in East Sheen, south-west London, the second of four sons of Ernest Fieldhouse, a commercial traveller, and his wife, Phyllis (nee Scott). After Wellington school, Roger studied modern history at Reading University, 1960-63; later, studying part-time, he was awarded a PhD (on the ideology of English adult education) by Leeds University.\nDuring his time at Leeds, Roger and his wife, Gill (nee Taylor), enjoyed a busy family life in Harrogate, bringing up their four children - Catherine, William, Edward and Victoria. They later divorced.\nIn 1986, Roger was appointed to the chair of continuing education at the University of Exeter, a post that he occupied until his retirement in 1996. He enjoyed village life in Devon and came to know Devon and Cornwall well. But he also travelled internationally \u2013 to Africa, Asia, Australia and New Zealand, with his partner of more than 30 years, Roseanne Benn.\nRoger, an English Romantic at heart, loved the English countryside. He was a member for 40 years of a group of friends who met for walking weekends in the Lake District; he was an enthusiast for English pubs and cricket; and we enjoyed for many years joint family holidays on the Welsh coast. He had, above all, a lifelong love of the Yorkshire Dales.\nRoger was a kind and generous man, much loved, valued and respected by family, friends, colleagues and students.\nHe is survived by Roseanne, whom he married in 2015, three stepdaughters and six step-grandchildren; and by the four children, and 11 grandchildren, from his marriage to Gill.",

        "content": "How better to liven up lockdown than to stage the entire Shakespeare canon online? Our writer reports on his role in the webcam drama\n\u2018Would you like to take part in a livestreamed performance of a Shakespeare play?\u201d An innocent enough request, and tempting in these monochrome, locked-down times. At first I think I am being offered a part in Henry IV Part I, a very good play I dimly remember from A-level. Perhaps I could play the fiery Hotspur. But I realise it is actually Henry VI Part I \u2013 early Shakespeare, co-written with others, and reckoned by some to be the Bard\u2019s weakest number. Oh well, you have to start somewhere. In any case it is too late. The die is cast, and so am I.\nThe enterprising director is Robert Myles, whose response to the lockdown has been to set about mounting the entire Shakespearean canon in chronological order, livestreaming a play a week on YouTube under the banner of The Show Must Go Online. He\u2019d done two already \u2013 The Two Gentlemen of Verona and The Taming of the Shrew \u2013 but this was to be the first history. Whether it would make history was another matter.\nWhy attempt this epic undertaking? \u201cI lost a gig that was going to take me to the end of April,\u201d Myles tells me, \u201cand it soon became apparent the same thing was happening to every actor.\u201d He decided to plug the gap. Rehearsals and the production are all done on Zoom.\nI suggest I should play the title role, but Myles points out Henry is only nine months old when he succeeds to the throne and this might be beyond even my acting skills. I get the part of the Duke of Burgundy instead. Burgundy doesn\u2019t have many lines but he does play a pivotal role, since switching his allegiance from the English to the French is crucial in turning the tide in this phase of the Hundred Years War. My ego is satisfied. I also quickly come to realise that 40 lines spread across half-a-dozen scenes is about my limit.\nThe play is largely impenetrable, with various English nobles vying for influence over the child king. \u201cThis one has been a beast!\u201d Myles tells his 25-strong cast \u2013 mostly professionals but with the odd am-dram enthusiast too, playing more than 60 roles and Zooming in from all over the world. I decide not to worry about what the Dukes of Gloucester, Somerset and Bedford are up to, and concentrate on my role instead.\nMyles tells us at the outset that he is playing it straight and not sending it up (which I would be very tempted to do) but there will still be lots of opportunities for on screen business, with castle walls made out of cardboard, plenty of alarums, battles and funeral processions, some lurid \u201cfuries\u201d putting in an appearance when Joan of Arc (who has galvanised the French forces) has a vision, and an array of silly hats.\nWith Myles\u2019s blessing, I decide to play Burgundy wearing a leather hat with ear muffs \u2013 the closest thing to a helmet I can find, even if it does make me look like an aviator. I also attempt an unusual reading of the role. The text portrays Burgundy as being converted to the French cause by Joan of Arc, but since she manages this in the space of two short speeches I find it implausible and decide he was looking for a pretext to switch sides. A brilliant reading, if based on nothing much more than a hunch.\n\u201cSubtext doesn\u2019t mix well with Shakespeare,\u201d Myles tells me, \u201cbut I\u2019m happy for you to do what you need to commit fully to a characterisation you can take ownership of. I think the clues that he\u2019s ultimately self-serving are there in the text.\u201d We are as one on the interpretation, though judging by the balls-up I make of the final rehearsal \u2013 making entrances when I should be making exits and vice versa \u2013 the subtleties of textual exegesis are probably the least of my worries.\nI am horribly nervous before the virtual curtain goes up and panic when my Zoom fails 20 minutes before we are due to go live. But producer Sarah Peachey restores my link and calms my nerves, and I settle in to follow the play on paper and speak my lines from chunks of on-screen text. At one point, trying to switch from paper to screen, I lose track of where we are, but just about find my place in time to speak my lines.\nWhat I can\u2019t do is act (no surprise there), spending all my time making sure I\u2019m using the mute button properly, appearing on screen when I\u2019m supposed to, and delivering my lines. I am listening neither to myself nor to my fellow actors, and am in awe of those who manage to achieve so much locked in their bedrooms, with so little rehearsal time and in a tiny space on screen. There are some truly wonderful performances, though sadly mine is not among them.\nMyles and Peachey move on to Henry VI Part II next week, and have more than 30 plays ahead of them \u2013 they are clearly planning for a lengthy lockdown. They encourage me to consider applying for a role in a future production. I wonder if the world is ready for my Hamlet.",

        "content": "As scientist David Nutt campaigns for drug rules to change, we look at artists who said yes to psychedelic culture\nWhile the neuropsychopharmacologist David Nutt and colleagues campaign for rules around psychedelics to change to aid research, such drugs have a long history in creative circles.\nLSD was important to the Beatles, whose song Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds is thought to be a nod to the drug, with psychedelics referred to in Day Tripper among others. LSD is also thought to have played an important role in the creation of the album Revolver. John Lennon and George Harrison were enthusiastic about taking the drug, whereas it took Paul McCartney some time to begin taking it.\nIn November 1963, as Aldous Huxley lay dying from cancer, he asked his wife, Laura, to give him LSD. The results were recorded in a letter from Laura to Huxley\u2019s brother. \u201cSuddenly he had accepted the fact of death; he had taken this moksha medicine in which he believed. He was doing what he had written in [his utopian novel] Island [which features psychedelic drug use], and I had the feeling that he was interested and relieved and quiet,\u201d she writes.\nDesigners including Michael English and Nigel Waymouth created hundreds of bright, swirling posters during the late 60s. Writing in his autobiography, the founder of Oz magazine, Richard Neville, remembered English and Waymouth telling him that \u201call our ideas come from trips\u201d.\nWhile psychedelic trips are often connected with artists from the 1960s, modern painters have also explored the impact of mind-altering drugs. Among them is Joe Roberts, who has produced works inspired by trips from LSD, DMT, and psilocybin. In 2018, he explained his thinking: \u201cPerhaps the most important thing is to inspire someone to see for themselves what the psychedelic experience is. I think they are incredible tools or teachers that we have access to, and they should be used. And like any tool, they should be treated with respect and used with caution.\u201d\nWithin the acting community, Susan Sarandon is among those known to advocate for psychedelic drugs, including LSD. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to solve all your problems,\u201d Sarandon told the Daily Beast \u201cBut, yes, I\u2019m totally supportive of that means to reframe your universe.\u201d",
